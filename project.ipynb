      "Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).Some championship races and cars can only be \"unlocked\" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful.\n",
      "1st shipment received a book instead of the game.2nd shipment got a FAKE one. Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box. I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content. They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD.Returned it good bye.!\n",
      "I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is. Like everything else Microsoft makes- it doesn't work. When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time. To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min. to accomplish. If you want another disappointment from Microsoft, buy some \"Games for Windows Live\" games.  I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting. If that's what you want, don't buy this. If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game, then buy it.  oh, one more thing, every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working (there's Windows 7 for you)\n",
      "I bought this and the key didn't work.  It was a gift, and the recipient wasn't able to solve the problem.  It might have been a good game, but I never found out because the key failed.\n",
      "Crashed in Vista.  Codemasters told me they don't support it in Windows 8.  Couldn't get it to work even after looking on the Internet.\n",
      "This game was a rip-off.  It has less terrain, less tracks, and less features than DiRT 2.  The graphics are about the same.  Not worth the money, at all.\n",
      "This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software. Then it did not have any voice sounds. Then it was running on windowed mode only. Now, everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer (BSoD).I give up. Codemasters, next time, dont rush a game out just because you have to. Test the game! If not for yourself for Colin himself. If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And don't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work, Steam will show you the finger :)\n",
      "DiRT 2 was like this.  I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.  Anyway,  just my opinion...\n",
      "I would like give this game 4 or 5 stars, if I could get it to run. Like others the game crashes on start-up or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it. Why they can't get their asses in gear (pun intended) and fix it I don't know, but with so many folks reporting the problem it isn't just occasional. I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim.\n",
      "I cannot get this thing to work with my Wii Rockband 3.It might be related to the USB hub that I'm using, but it simply refuses to be detected by the game.Cosmetically, it's a microphone. Bit on the ugly side.I would be wary of compatibility issues with this one.\n",
      "The greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time.To begin I will provide Amazon's customer base the &#34;tale of the turd&#34; as I call it in relation to this abomination's &#34;quality&#34; or rather lackthereof:Gameplay: Utterly challengeless. A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or &#34;spam&#34; the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque &#34;Screw you!&#34; to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: &#34;Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!&#34;We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.Aonuma's first game &#34;Marvelous&#34; failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more:Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).Conclusion: My rating of this turd is 1 star since I can't give it lower due to how Amazon's system is set up.\n",
      "Are 9 out of 10 GAMECUBE games like this little kid's game terrible? Answer: YesI bought the game, and I regret it so much!\n",
      "I was very disappointed in this item.  We thought we would get a better picture than the standard WII video cables, but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction.  I would not recommend.\n",
      "There are at least 5 missions that cannot be completed without joining the forum, then the Creator's Forum, and a lot of research, downloading, etc.  4 of these defective missions were built by \"Bottman\"...someone that should definitely find another occupation.BUT...do not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging.  The ones they label as \"Hard\" are as easy as those labeled \"Easy\".  My 6-year granddaughter could do most of them after 15 minutes of instruction.Do not buy this product.  The GFX are circa 2003, the user interface far from intuitive, and the support abysmal. It's a waste of money & time.Too bad.  Ship.sim 2006 was actually better....AND all the missions worked.  Vstep took one giant step backward.\n",
      "This thing was DOA. It wasn't even worth returning for the money I spent on it. Don't waste your money on this card.\n",
      "I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well, my problem(s)?Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )It's cheap now so, I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it.\n",
      "this is an excellent game that really has some substance! the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy VII. if FF7 was too long for you, get breath of fire 3. the story is good and the battle system is great!\n",
      "I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well, it was hard to locate where you were going, unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately, the writers expected us to know as well.\n",
      "Yes I'll review Batman & Robin to the Playstation and why couldn't have been like Batman Forever arcade. It's wrose than Batman Forever on SNES and Genesis. I don't know which is wrose this game or the Joel Schumacer film. Becuse I don't know what to do after I get the diamond. I know what I'm getting with the film a very bad one. Just leave them both alone.\n",
      "This game is complete crap.The graphics look decent,but the gameplay is for sh**.I can't even begin to tell you how bad \"Batman & Robin\" is.First off,the controls are terrible.You have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fight,drive the batmobile,swim,use the gadgets...it's even a pain to try and walk.The map of Gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the same.The game is also almost impossible.You get one life.After you die,it's game over,and right back to the beginning.You can also die quickly as well.You can play as either Batman,Robin or Batgirl,but their combat moves look absolutley retarded.Overall,this is THE WORST Batman game I have EVER PLAYED! \"Batman Forever\" on Genesis was better then this dud,and we all know how bad that game was.I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this.The ONLY reason why you MIGHT wanna purchase this,is because it's a pretty rare game,and it could be a part of your game collection,but as far as the game itself goes....IT SUCKS!\n",
      "I was only 5 years old my first time playing this game back in Christmas of 1997. I was never able to get past the first couple levels then. But I always loved this game. It was magic back then. The graphics were also great THEN. Second time around, I was 12 and it was 2004. I was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to. Now in 2012, I had the urge to replay this game again. To get those feeling of being so young. I'm 19, and the magic is completely gone, and for ONE REASON.BE WARNED...... if you have a full HD TV and have a PS3, and bought a physical copy of this game......the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely HORRIBLE! It completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because EVERYTHING is so pixelated if you will. Like I NEVER remembered this game looking so bad before, but I have to assume it had always looked this way but I was in a different era of technology then. HD TVs are completely unforgiving to these types of games. I'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the PSN is any better, but the actual physical copy is not meant for a HD display even in it respective aspect ratio. Maybe just playing this game on standard definition TV might help, but I haven't tried that either. I will just have to remember the game like when I was young as the best PS1 game I ever played and then later the only one I ever beat. To the future gamers!\n",
      "I *hate* this game.  Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.WWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.\n",
      "This wwf game sucks...Boring...Graphics are alright...It was just plain awful EVEN FOR IT'S TIME!UGH this game was slo[...] get this game..GET NO MERCY!  BEST WWF GAME EVER!...This game was very dull and boring...If I could give it a zero I would...THIS GAME FLAT OUT SUCKS!good thing I Baught this for a 2 bucks....But still that was a waste...Later\n",
      "Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics,better realism, and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good, after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much.\n",
      "Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money.Uneven gameplay,and few options plague this game,it is also way too short even at this reduced price.Spend your money on a game,just not this one.Hope this helps,I hate to have games collecting dust,but this is one of those and I own about 50 recent games so I know what's what.\n",
      "I thought Red Alert was a pretty fun game. This was just a clone of red alert though. The people that make C&amp;C need to come up with some more ideas. All the C&amp;C games are exactly the same. I didn't like Red Alert to start with so Tiberian Sun has to be worse.\n",
      "the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...  END\n",
      "I found Half-Life to be somewhat interesting, although it started to run thin by the ending levels. Not many of the levels were amazing, either. Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena.Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager.Aside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels, the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities. If you want a weekend of pure hell (both keeping you  stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely) then buy this game.  Otherwise, don't bother.\n",
      "this is the stuppidiest game i've ever played. I advise everyone not to play it or buy it. It really sucked.\n",
      "this game is the hardest game ive ever played, and that takes away the fun. also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 cannot even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n64 game ever\n",
      "When I looked for the game I was looking for this for a tear Play Station 3. The view on this game I liked. When I received it was not discovered for version 3, but 2.I am very upset\n",
      "I have played this game before and it is very fun! That is why I came to Amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that I could go back in time and enjoy a classic game. However, I bought it from the seller &#34;Warehouse Deals, Inc&#34; and I did NOT get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them. Watch Out!\n",
      "This game is ok, but mostly mediocre. This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark. The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage.  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission.Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.  Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor.So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title. Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least. They haven't made anything decent since though\n",
      "I just wanna review out something no ones said yet.If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didnt include certain things that the PC version and better version had.First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!Convinced the PC versions better? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking, huh?\n",
      "mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.\n",
      "I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE. JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL, PASS, AND WITH NO ITEM, THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED. HORRIBLE\n",
      "Seriously, this ranks up with some of the worst games I have ever played. It is a complete insult to anyone who respects the RPG genre as this is nothing more than a linear, cutesy, puzzle game. You run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around, jumping from platform to platform, and killing enemies (with an awful targeting system) that respawn as soon as you leave the room.I can guarantee that about 95% of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them. But if you are an older, more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad.If you'll excuse me I am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge.\n",
      "Seriously, it's one of the worst games ever! Terrible graphics, especially compared to the PS Triple's, no voice acting, boring puzzles, and above all, it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game. Plus why is the main villian black? That's racist!For a good Zelda game, I recommend Link: The Faces of Evil, The Wand of Gamelon, or Zelda's Adventure.\n",
      "There's many that love this so-called masterpiece, but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack. Sticking to the superior original.\n",
      "Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good.  I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.  Let the series END already.\n",
      "Twisted Metal 3 is overrated - because it's not normally considered the worst Playstation game.  I can't believe how unfun this game is.  The  control is laughable.  The gameplay is incredibly boring.  The music is Rob  Zombie, which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row.  The  game also adds almost nothing new.  Don't even rent this one.\n",
      "Trust me, Do not buy this game.  I am the local TM lover and know-all.  I bought TM4, TM2, and TM3 (sadly I can't find a copy of TM1)  After i bought TM2, I was looking forward to cool characters, cool battlegrounds, and semi-pixated graphics.  I found none of these things.  There are only 4 new characters, Club Kid, Auger, Flamethrower, and my favorite new driver, Flower Power.  The levels, especially Washington DC, is a small open level, which is no fun.  The North Pole is annoying, and I hate the boring London level.  The graphics are cheesy, and 989 studios tried to make them look too real.  The cars flip over with every tight turn you make, when another car hits you, or you drive onto a hill.  This game is not realistic.  This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title.  I warn you, do not even look at this game.  It is the worst.  The car combat genre is in shame.\n",
      "To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!\n",
      "Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds, espessially in pits.  Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes.  The graphics are terrible, the music is annoying and it's just boaring.\n",
      "I'll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out, with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity.  I'm more of an action person, not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person.  Sure,  Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year.  I  turned out to be one of the latter people.  No matter how hard I tried, I  could never get the income to come out positive.  So, I did what any  distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes!  An hour  later, I was bored.  If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000  out.  But, if you're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words,  try Dungeon Keeper 2, a game like Simcity 3000, but not as complex (and  more active!).\n",
      "Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games?  That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.\n",
      "Augh! I found the first few levels of Crash 1 harder than the 3rd world levels Crash 2 and 3. It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next. This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or... hell, I don't know. I just had to repeat the level because it wouldn't let me continue.Also, there is no giant screen where you can save. You have to find the bonus platform, and make it all the way through the bonus part to save. Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus? Sorry! You're just going to have to hope you don't die or else you'll have to repeat EVERYTHING. OVER. AGAIN.A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him. Be nice to your children. Buy them Crash 2. Or 3. Or games from the Spyro series, that would work too.If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it's dirt cheap to buy.. (haha) Put the money towards something BETTER.\n",
      "Ok, here are the reasons this game is BAD!.1. The graphics aren't very good and plus most of the levels look alike.2. It's frustrating, and there are millions of ways to die in one level.3. You'll wish you never had this game.4. Most of it doesn't make any sense and it's un-imaginative.There.  Are those good enough reasons NOT to get this game? Don't get it.\n",
      "If you like orange bandicoots and video games, then get Crash Bandicoot, the stuff of dreams and legends. \"I am N.Gin you FOOL! Face my destructive robots!\" That is my fave quote. If you hop on the 'shrooms right before the end o' the 2nd snow bear level and go to the central one, you shall find none other but a secret tele-port. You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense. Congrats.\n",
      "Everytimes we loaded the game it would play for maybe 5 mins and then would keep freezing and not play and my gaming system is not messed up I cant return the game I threw away the bag I wish companies would test their damn games before selling them disapointed.\n",
      "I bought it because it was cheaper than buying the original version which it is identical to except for item placements...\n",
      "This game is horrible. First, I bought this video &quot;game&quot; because I thought it was fun. Well in wasn't. 1st, the graphics are poor. 2nd the computer's difficulty level is so hard. If you play with one, two, or three people, you always lose. The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be, and it just degrades from the fun factor. So ignore the reviews that say it is so great. They are overexxagerating. My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours.\n",
      "This game is so stupid like one of the revier's said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door. And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before. This game is like doom, you know the one where you just see the weapon. Dont' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat.\n",
      "The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult. It takes some getting used to. The image was very dark, not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem. The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this. The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together. Overall i was not happy with the game itself. I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product.\n",
      "...  In more ways then one, it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye, but fails miserably.  Considering this game was made after Goldeneye, you would think it would at least have quality graphics, but no.  Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating, where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character.  The missions are vrey booring too.  This game is very hard even on the \"possible\" setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game.\n",
      "Avarage rpg with long and boring combact system, less than avarage story, dull characters, poor dialogue and dull graphics. Dont' waste your money in such weak product.\n",
      "Products offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand. Often they are unlicensed third party knock-off expansion packs. Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games. Look for sellers offering the real thing by Nintendo. Ive warned you. You can save a few bucks and take your chances. Deviation from the actual product isn't even allowed on Amazon. Their very listings are a violation to begin with. Their feedback speaks for itself.\n",
      "I have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo 64 and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues. The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion Pak.\n",
      "This game is so oold you can't even get the graphics!I suggets that if you didn't play this game but you all ready played ruby/sappire you will hate this game. I say wait for fire red and leaf green 2 come out it's the same thing but the graphics are alot better.\n",
      "This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!\n",
      "The gameboy color was good but i really like the 1989 gameboy the grey one that takes 4 batteries\n",
      "Honestly, there's nothing good about this game.  The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for.  The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation.  If you like games with good graphics, do not get this game.The gameplay isn't that great, also.  The N64 version is much better, because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic, and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics.  Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: \"Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A.\" Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didn't have much money at the time, so they decided to make a mediocre game.  This was bad.  Believe me.If you want a game with good gameplay, excellent graphics, wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it, get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.If you want a game with awful graphics, bad gameplay, no storyline sequences, and a Sega Genesis feel, then get this game.This game is not worth any money at all.\n",
      "I've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time. I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes. Total Meltdown is the most frustrating  FPS I have ever played. The speed is so fast it is hard to move. Looking up and down is a chore.You use L1 and L2 to look up and down. Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible. Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible. Sound is bad as well. The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook(it is funny). The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations. Even the cutscenes are bad. Please try to avoid this game and save some cash.\n",
      "Yes, people, this game sucks big time. This game came with the original Nintendo system back in late 1980s. I had a hard time trying to beat this game because the control was down right horrible. Most of the time you'll jump off edges by accident. And who ... would pay ... to relive the nightmare of this game? Apparent, 82 people who reviewed this game and my friend did.\n",
      "Wow, Superman! This game has earned the lowest review score I have ever given a game (and I've given some rather s***ty scores), and the second lowest score I have given a product I've reviewed. I find it absolutely sickening when some of the people who reviewed this game; like ShaqFu (A guy who named himself after what many people would proclaim as the worst fighting game of all time and one of the worst games of all time, mind you), said that this game was a masterpiece and quote on quote, \"This is by far the best game on the N64.\" WHAT?! You're not serious are you? This is definitely not the best game on the N64, it is without a doubt the worst game to plague the N64. That's like the stupid people who say the that the God-awful Gamecube was way better than the PS2 and Xbox, it's not an opinion, it's the truth that those things suck. To show my love for the N64, instead I will give you a list of my personal favorite N64 titles you should play instead of this:1. Perfect Dark2. Starfox 643. Conker's Bad Fur Day4. Resident Evil 25. Mario Kart 646. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater7. Spider-Man8. Star Wars Episode I Racer9. Road Rash 6410.Pilotwings 6411.San Francisco Rush series12.Goldeneye 00713.Turok seriesetc., etc., etc.There, go play those instead. Those games are a million times better each than this game will ever be. Now let's talk about the glorious Superman 64 in all of its greatness!WHAT THE GAME IS: The story seems straight out of an award-winning movie. Superman's friends have been kidnapped by Lex Luthor and thrown into a virtual metropolis. Superman must go save his friends and the world from the evil deeds of Lex. This game feels like a Pilotwings/Beat 'em up/Find the button game.GRAPHICS: The people who gave this game 5-star reviews said the graphics are amazing. Are they? Why yes, if you think a game that looks like a PSone game made on a budget of $10 or it looks someone vomited Fruity Pebbles all over the TV screen, then yes it does look fantastic. Absolutely mind-blowing especially with the numerous glitches in the environments. The programming work done by Titus is stunning indeed. Superman can go through walls unexpectedly or can stuck in random places and will be unable to move for a brief period of time. Wow, Titus!MUSIC: The musical score is truly amazing. It's the kind of musical score that makes a person want to drown some kittens when they hear it. I want this composer's hand then slap them across the face and tell them, \"Wow, way to suck!\"SOUND: The sound effects seem like they were recorded in a basement. Everything is too quiet or it echoes. Another accomplished feat for the guys who made this game. Even something as simple as sound effects suck.GAMEPLAY: During my playthrough of the game this is how the missions went; Fly through the rings! Pick up those cars before those people get crushed! Fly through more rings! Pick up that police car and take it to the other side of the road! Fly through more rings! Beat those four thugs armed with guns! Fly through more rings! Use your ice breath to stop those tornadoes from sucking up those people! Fly though more rings! Go into a building! Beat up robots and find a keycard! Insert keycard then go to an elevator to another with even more robots to beat up! Destroy those robots, open those doors, and rescue those people underground! Go disarm bombs, and along the way beat up more robots, a tank, and a woman who has better skills than you do! The repetition goes on and on and on. This game is very repetitive. Extremely repetitive to be exact. And very broken too. Overall, this game plays out like Pilotwings, except you break the controls, and the make the dated visuals even worse.OVERALL: If you enjoy life and don't wish to pollute the classic N64 stay away from this horrible game. I'm surprised Nintendo didn't do what Atari did with E.T. for the Atari 2600. Destroy thousands of copies and bury them in New Mexico. Worst of all there's a Nintendo Seal of Quality on the box. How did nobody stand up to say, \"This game sucks,\" that's all it would have taken.THE GOOD: (This category has been left blank for obvious reasons).THE BAD: Everything. Every single thing is bad about this game.\n",
      "If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad.\n",
      "Fly threw rings and pick up cars...this game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anus.\n",
      "Bad games happen all the time, but only the worst of the worst are talked about years after their release. Superman 64 is just one of those games. Receiving no positive reception when it was released in '99, it is a laughing joke and quite a disgrace to the Man of Steel. This looks like a job for...a hammer to smash the cartridge with.GRAPHICS: Bad, even for its time. Blocky characters compiled with glitches in movement and glitches in general. The town is full of 'kryptonite fog', which is just an excuse for the lack of perception in the town. Simply inexcusable.MUSIC: The same repetitive tunes, over and over and over and over...STORY: How long did it take for Titus to think of this epic story. Pretty much, Lex Luthor traps Superman's friends in a virtual world, and for some reason, Superman flies through rings and saves virtual people on his way to finding them.CONTROLS: I once recall someone on Gamefaqs saying that Superman controls like a 500 pound man on drugs. That's an understatement. Taking off and flying requires lots of work, while Superman himself steers like a drunk driver.GAMEPLAY: Before starting a stage, you have to start a series of awful missions. For some reason, Superman flies through rings, rings, and more rings, and this is quite difficult with the godawful controls. After that, Superman does odd missions such as saving people from cars, beating shadows, or stopping tornadoes with his ice breath. Note that all of this is virtual, so why is he bothering to save them? Then after that, he flies through more rings, does a mission, more rings, and eventually the level begins. The levels themselves are terrible as well, filled with glitches and the fact that Superman is super weak. He is the Man of Steel, yet an explosion is enough to kill him. After the level is completed, the whole cycle starts all over again. As with all Titus games, to fully complete it you must play on the hardest difficulty, which is just plain stupid.BUY: No! Stay away at all costs and don't let it corrupt your N64. Well, if you are interested, get it on an emulator, because even paying a dollar for this game is asking too much.\n",
      "This is one of the worst games of all time.  I remember playing this as a kid and just kept sucking at it.  When I was a kid, I didn't understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful.  The control in this game is really bad, especially during the ring stages.  You'll just fly all over the place.  The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly, but you have a time limit, so you don't have time to move slowly.  When I got to a point where I could fight, it was like a maze and had no idea where to go.  The ONLY reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only, and even then, they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrel.\n",
      "Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought \"superman, I'll have to try that\". I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far, far away, Superman weeps.\n",
      "I could go on and on, but look, it is really very simple. It's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it.So to all, always PRONTO pay attention to mister number one best sheriff student's idiotic post (i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are cool...White Trash that sums you up :) have a nice dayAnd don't forget, you hafta agree with me at all times, click on the YES button under my review, obey me, everything that has to do with good things of me\n",
      "This game does not, in fact, star Superman. It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman. Stuporman staggers like a drunken person, relies on power-ups for super powers, pulls punches so enemies beat him, likes random time limits (including ones that lead to an instant game over), can pass through solid objects like they aren't even there, and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years, like ordinary bullets and explosions. He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak. All part of Lex Luthor's evil plan! If you love Superman, don't buy this game, or you'll be buying into a lie!\n",
      "When I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited, then they delayed the release date, which usually means the game is going under even more improvements.  When I bought Superman I sped all the way home, turned off my phone and sat in my chair.  To my suprise, this game is not worth the plastic it's made of.  I don't even have one good thing to say about it.  I was extremely disappointed.  Superman used to be cool.\n",
      "I didn't even play this game and I don't own an N64, but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people won't buy it since it's supposed to be the WORST GAME EVER.\n",
      "In \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\", David Carradine described Superman as follows, \"Not a very good comic; not particularly well-drawn.\"  Well, I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character, then the game must be cool too, right?  It's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system.  It must be good, since we're still talking about all these years later.Seriously, there's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64.  You won't need any sort of defect warranty, because the second you flip the POWER switch, it works every time.  It's refreshing to buy an electronic device, knowing that it's electrical circuits will never fail you.Equally cool is that Superman flies in this game...I like it when he flies.  Every time I pop in this cartridge, I'm even more eager to watch  the Christopher Reeve movies...all 4 of them.The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint.  You see, there are bizarre, murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick wouldn't be able to visualize.  For example, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to, um...a blurry contraption that kidnaps them; or does it imprison them?  I personally couldn't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois, because it's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes.  But isn't it neat to figure it out for yourself?  You see, because the graphics are so confusing and blurry, you get to keep playing again to unearth the game's secrets.  And don't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time, either.  It's a tough game, and there are few games that equal its challenge.What's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman's emotional state.  I'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly; it's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7.  Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully.  You see, when Superman flies, he won't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do.  A free-spirited main character...brilliant!Lastly, Superman's powers are present here.  He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath.  That's always neat, huh?  But what's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel --- according to this game --- has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists.  He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky, and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis.  How cool is that?  On the other side of this spectrum, there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch......you know, I still haven't figured out how to beat those sections of the game.  I wonder, is there a higher power known only to Superman?  I ask, because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry.  The most gifted scientists, researchers, cryptologists, artists, and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.SUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming!*****THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL.  I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BUY THIS GAME!*****\n",
      "This game was soooo bad, I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from. I got it since I am a Superhero fan, but trust me, even if you are a diehard fan of Superman, resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free!!!!! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.When i first turned the game on, the people in the first level looked like an oil painting. And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings!!! Miss one ring and words show up that say,\"Lex wins\" and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy's laugh.I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at!!! I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game!!!! 'sob'\n",
      "Once again we have an example of an Amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something else.This CD-ROM did not even come in a protective plastic jacket. I suppose little Tommy's parents wouldn't give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the Amazon Dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copy.\n",
      "not worth 10 cents, graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick. The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die. Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring. After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it. A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately dont waste any money on this game, it down right sucks\n",
      "Oh, here they come! Can you hear it? The wimpy cries of the thousands and thousands of fanboys and fangirls of this failure of an RPG! I can certainly hear them, because I've been listening to them for the past few years. I will admit, I was excited to play this game at first, seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008...but honestly, I wish I had never played it at all. Why? Well, stick around, sit back, shut up and read.STORY: 2/10Atrocious. Simply atrocious. You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud (default name, seeing as you have the option to name your main character), who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE. Why these groups and names have big, capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me, seeing as they don't stand for anything. Along the way, you'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you'll be doing in the current area you're in, get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters, and finally come to the climax of the game, facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes...but not because it's hard. It's not. I have so many problems with this game's story...okay, I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD. You get a total of 9 characters in your party, and guess what? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever! The only reason they exist is for party-filling, seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to...well, ANYTHING. Two of them you don't even technically have to get in your party to begin with! You can literally beat the entire game--all 13-17 hours of it--with the drooling retards you pick up along the way. The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story, and everywhere you turn, you can see something you can bitch about for hours. Party members included.GAMEPLAY: 1/10Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time. There's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game. It's the same boring, lazy turn-based system you're used to, except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable. The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched, and every time you use an attack, skill, or spell, you'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass. Oh, and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia...well, I certainly hope you stocked up on food, drinks, and toilet paper; you'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.PRESENTATION: 0/10What are you talking about? This game is CLEARLY not even finished. Do you know how many glitches, bugs, and excruciating errors I found while playing this game? Hundreds. The sickest part? I didn't go out of my way to find them. They came to me. The character models look ridiculous, nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game, the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise's name, and you'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two. Or ten. Not only that, but the game is WAY too easy. I literally played through the entire game--story and all--in less than 20 hours. In that time, I never once died or even lost a member of my party (if you're not counting Aeris, seeing as she dies in a cutscene). And hey, if you're having trouble with something, just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls, gain infinite money and items, level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight, deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit, or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats, items, and equipment you already have. But seriously, who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once? This unfinished, broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.SOUNDTRACK: 0/10What soundtrack? It's just a bunch of clicks, screeches, and otherwise infuriating sounds. It's not music. It's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds, or your money back! GUARANTEED!OVERALL RATING: 1/10This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did. It's especially lucky that Amazon.com's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars. If it was a standard 1-10 rating, I'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10, seeing as I can't stand this absolute travesty of a video game. It's a downright abomination to the world, and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy, like myself. I'm glad I didn't play this game until years after it came out. If I had played it back then, I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time. You can't rate a game based on how well it sold, and you can't rate a game depending on the graphics. Why? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review. I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon. It's not worth a penny out of your pocket.\n",
      "oh hey those pixelated shemales are gonna save the world over 701251709 hours of boring gameplay! this game super mega dumb.\n",
      "Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man, are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh, you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics, horrible gameplay, sucky battle system, hard to understand, VERY difficult to get into it, too confusing, dumbxxx characters like cloud, hes the worst.(except sephiroth), sometimes too long of cutscenes, boring cutscenes, you can barely see their eyes &amp; mouth, etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.I hate this game.\n",
      "I'd like to preface my review by saying I had heard A LOT about this game. The main character, Cloud, is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games (like Kingdom Hearts) so I was really interested in trying it out. That, coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like IGN, which quotes that FFVII is \"The RPG by which all others are to be measured, FFVII is a cinematic wonder\" had me thrilled to try this out. For some perspective, IGN quotes my favorite game of all time, Zelda Ocarina of Time, as \"IGN64 reviews the biggest game of the decade. Does Zelda 64 live up to the hype?\" I never owned a PS until the PS2 & PS3, so I was stoked to see this title come out on the PS network for $9.99.Now that you know a little bit about what I was expecting from this game, I'll provide a little bit about my gaming style/history before I go into the game review. I'm a huge RPG fan, and I like a variety of games in that style (turn-based, timer, real time strategy, action). I've played a few FF games (III, X, Tactics, Tactics II), and I liked them all, except for X, which I found to be a little too easy, albeit very pretty. I also really enjoy the Dragon Quest games. I've been into video games since I was 5, and apart for a work-induced stint of abstinence in college, I still enjoy video games when time permits.As soon as I started playing this game I kept telling myself, it must get better. It's just a slow start, surely the story picks up? I pushed on for a few hours, going through Clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before I finally gave it up as a bad job. I'm glad I only spent $9.99 to try this game out, and not $100+.Graphics:I'm not sure what IGN is talking about, but these graphic are terrible. Yes, I know the game is from 1997, but Zelda OCT came out in 1998 and it's graphics have held up to the test of time much better. Although the PS and N64 (pre-graphics expansion) are supposed to be comparable, a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross (1999 PS). The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch. Also, since it was being released on the PS network, Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics (like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube) instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs. Maybe it would look better on an old TV? Who knows. The cut scenes have slightly better graphics, which are almost comparable to Zelda OCT's in game graphics.Story:I wasn't really impressed by it, although it it's an interesting concept. I've done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers won't have the story spoiled for them.GOOD/Unique:When you boil it down, you are basically fighting as an eco-terrorist, and that's an interesting concept.BAD:The character integration into the story is very poor. When you look at all the character's background stories, it doesn't make sense that they are all working together. If the game spent more time with them discussing WHY they have their common goal of being ECO-terrorists it would fit better. Aside from the fact that they are all eco-terrorists who live in the same beat down community, they really have nothing in common.I did not like the characters I had been introduced to, before I quite playing. Cloud is incredibly angsty and self-centered in the beginning, and I found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant. His friendship with Tifa doesn't make much sense to me either. Tifa is a sweet person, and portrayed as kind-hearted, yet she seems to be obsessed with Cloud who is nothing like her emotionally. Barret, um, can we say racist? Barret, the only black person in the game, consistently beats his chest like a gorilla. Yes, let's make the black person look and act like a gorilla.Gameplay:Mediocre.This is the most important part for some people, although I tend to find the story to be nearly as important. For me, if the story is bad, it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game. The game play here was average, it has a pretty typical timer set-up, nothing to write home about. I'm not sure if this game invented timer play, if so Kudos to Square Enix. The timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions, so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play. Once I figured out the game play though (~1hr of game time, most of which is scenes) I quickly grew tired of this game.Summary:This game has average game play, terrible story, horrific graphics even for a late 90's game, and pretty pathetic characters. I played for 3-4 hours and then gave up on it. My free time is limited, and I don't waste time on games that aren't fun because \"they might get better.\" Maybe FFVII really picks up in hour 4. All I know is that I was very disappointed in the game, and I'm quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on Amazon and on other gaming sites.UPDATE:Barrett - when Cloud is introduced to headquarters, Barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which I found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing. However, his overall portrayal may not be that racist, as I only played for 4 hours and many claim he is treated better in the later game.Despite the comments and emails I've gotten about this review, I still leave it as 1-star. Without the nostalgia goggles I didn't enjoy the story, the graphics, the gameplay, or the characters.\n",
      "When I first bought my PS2, I got FF10, FF9, and FF7.  That was back in 2002.  FF10 & FF9 I liked. Good stories & loveable characters.  But FF7 was a drag.Then I saw all the positive reviews (\"best game ever\"), so I decided to give FF7 a second playing in 2004, to impress me.  But I still did not like it.  IMHO the major flaw is that FF7 has too many \"dry\" sections where you fight-fight-fight and almost nothing happens storywise (example - climbing the 100-floor building of your enemy -or- the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress).  In some sections, literally hours pass by with no story... it feels like a step backwards to the near-nonexistent stories of the original nintendo..Also the Battle Engine - totally unbalanced.  A good RPG will provide balance between physical & magical attacks, so they are near-equal.  A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills & weaknesses (like real people-some are fighters; others are healers). Not so FF7:- it's all magic... physical attacks are worthless (about 1/4 the damage)- and the characters are completely interchangeable. You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl.  And then the next battle, completely flip it around, so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer.  And then flip it again!  No individuality. Each character is identical.  Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting... not realistic at all..Also, the story, while good, is poorly executed.  It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planet's \"health\" - very simple concept - but the writer dances around & adds un-necessary complication.  He takes 2+2 = 4 and turns it into 1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4.  That's why so many gamers go, \"Huh? What just happened?\"  It was a good story, but a lousy script.Overall, FF7 is one of the weakest games in the FF series (inferior to the other PS1 game-FF9, super nintendo games FF4, FF5, FF6, even inferior to FF10.\n",
      "I got the PC version of this game and its A far cry from the others in the NFS series. The graphics are horrid, the cars are weird not more normal cars like the ferraris or jaguars in the other need for speeds. The cars are hard to control, its way to easy to spin out and crash. The menu controls are hard to use to, for instance most of the options dont have A pull-down menu you have to cycle through all the options. If you want great racing get Need for Speed 3, High Stakes, or Porsche Unleashed.\n",
      "If you want a game that you can master in 5 mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT. I beat the game as I got it once I discovered \"the formula\"...I'll list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundownPros1) Characters are unique and fun with personality, i.e. personal story, ending etc (missing from PS2)2) Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive3) The moves and effects are radical (King Capcom shines here)4) Fast action5) Cool Japanese voicesCons1) One dimensional fighting sucks as a 3D fighting game!!2) Weapons make no sense once you know the formula! They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula!!OverallOverall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game. The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed. Powerstone 2 got it right and is a blast, read my review!\n",
      "Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake! The game looks great and sounds great, but its too easy. The game that is supposed to be the game for &quot;die hard fighting fans&quot; is basically a walk in the park. The game is a button masher! I played the game and found that &quot;turtling up&quot; and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this &quot;demon sword wielding&quot; game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game. What sick minds came up with this anyway?If the game had a better plot (one that involved some thought) then it would be a classic, but as it stands...no.\n",
      "People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game.This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window.The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring.I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay.If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is.Avoid this nerf dung at all costs.\n",
      "I played this on the N64 when I was a kid and it was funny and hilarious. The problem with that is... This isn't the N64. This Playstation version sucks! There's only about half the weapons and half the maps or the N64 version. This is more like a demo!\n",

      "I bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system. It's graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play. But the chances are that it will now be a dying system. With Sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow. While more and more PSX2 get into peoples homes the same cannot be said for the DC.  There maybe 70+ games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease. A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become.  Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line. The local video stores around me have dropped Dc. Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale. The DC section had been replaced with PSX2 games.  Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX2 and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind.  Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry. The current price is very very good. But it is consol taking it's last breaths.  Was the PSX2 heaps better. I don't think so. Not from what I saw. I enjoy my DC immensly and played it for many many hours. But it's day is gone. The future is the PSX2. A shame really both for Sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar console's.  Because of this I personally will not buy Sega gear in the future.\n",
      "Sega does not even deserve a one star.  The only good games for Sega is Sonic te Hedgehog.  Sega announced the are making a deal with Nintendo to send Sonic to Nintendo.  Sega has decided to give up to the competition.  Finally.  They will now only make games.  I am happy for that.  I am a Nintendo Fan.  Zelda and Mario and I will be glad to see Soninc coming to Nintendo.  Dreamcast starting in February will drop ....  At the end of the year goodbye Sega.  Now our only compettioor is that damn Playstation and the Xbox will compete.  But Nintendo Rules\n",

      "Let's sum up what is great about Dreamcast:  Sensational graphics (equal to PS2), great sound, good controller design and an excellent, although not outstanding, software line up.Now, what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low ------ Sega Corporation!!!If you haven't heard the announcement yet, Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console.  This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low.  I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn.  Once the Saturn production was stopped, only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them.When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX (the same programming API as Windows for the PC) I was very excited, because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast.  There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come (Urban Chaos, Rainbow Six) were bad.Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies.  I believe that Sega owes it's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform.  My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years.  My Dreamcast lasted six months.  Goodbye Sega purchases forever.\n",
      "This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market.  It has a horrible design, is made of cheap plastic, and to make matters worse, it's  also highly priced.  Don't even think about using it for games like Marvel  Vs. Capcom, because even casual play will break this controller.  If you're  serious about games, find an import controller made by another company.  Don't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America, they  are all just as bad, if not worse.\n",
      "I don't mind if the graphics aren't completely state of the art, but this was ridiculous.  Not only were the graphics terrible, but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible.  I  ran this game on a P3-733Mhz with a DDR GeFORCE256 video card and could not  enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you  would receive depending upon where in the track you were.  Terrible.  Even  at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish.  I-76, which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill NS4.  I am unbelievably dissapointed.\n",
      "To be quite honest, I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I've ever played. The narrative sequences are ridiculously long, the graphics are mediocre, and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed. I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it, and I was terribly disappointed.\n",
      "I've always been a Thief fan, especially Thief 1. I'd read about this game over the years, but never played it because I was busy playing other games. This game was developed by the same folks who made Thief, so I figured it had to be great.I rate it with one star because I cannot install it on an SD card and play it on my netbook which lacks a CD drive. Even after doing a full install, the game refuses to start without a disk in the non-existant drive. This is inexcusable because I *paid* for this game, while those who obtain it through other means are able to do the above.Once again, I (the honest customer) get shafted. I regret buying this game and I will never ever touch another EA-published product again. Thanks guys!To all the gamers, ask yourself this question: How will you play all of these games that require a CD in the drive to run when modern computers eventually stop using optical media? Oh, but I forgot, nobody is supposed to be playing games from a decade ago. We're all supposed to get the shiny title of the month!\n",
      "This is just like an arcade game you play at a bowling alley or something.  For those who like those kinds of games then maybe the game would work for you.  But I found this game extremely boring and no fun\n",
      "This game was bought and rather farfetched. I hoped it would work and It doesn't play story mode at all. So I'm stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session. A shame.\n",
      "Costing as much as fifty dollars new at the time, I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in 1999 or so when I played my N64 a lot.The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break.  The first stupid thing it does is in its use, you put the Gameshark into the slot, then stick the game up on top of it.  As with many cartridge game systems, it seems you need to wiggle it about, and position it just right just for it to work.  I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided, because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way, like it's supposed to.Of all the functions it has, half of them don't even work.  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games, and at worst, caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark.  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code, and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark's memory with useless information.  Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked, names were screwed up with random characters and letters, and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke---both VHS's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT!  If you still remember how VHS's work, this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT!  I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS, packaged it with the Gameshark, sent it back for a refund, and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else!Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run.  It doesn't ruin your game permanently, but it ruins itself just fine.  There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working.\n",
      "I know what you're thinking... I need another controller. The generic can't be that bad, I might not like it, but I'll be able to play.No, you will not. You wll hate every minute of this.As others have said, the buttons are actually ok, but the d-pad will drive you insane. Rage quit-inducing. Don't bother, go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual, old SNES controller. The price will be well worth it. I've pretty much thrown this in the garbage, but I can't seem to bring myself to it for some reason, but it deserves it.\n",
      "This is a very dissapointing system. Slow loading, Bad graphics, and terrible games. But it has a good controller.\n",
      "As usual Interact accessories dissapoint. This Tremor Pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks. The slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you hand....not good at all. Instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyance!AVOID AT ALL COST. Get the official Sega Jump pak instead\n",
      "This thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play. It is at times comical. It makes your controller rattle, you hear shaking noises, and feel like you are having some sort of seizure.This tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion. It will go the way of Robbie the Robot for the NES. Remember him? Neither does anybody else...It is an interesting idea, but it doesn't really enhance the games. Just because the controller shakes in your hands doesn't mean you feel like part of the game. In fact, with all the shaking, it might even disrupt your game play. You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot, at least that enhances your gaming experience. I have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours I took it out and haven't used it since. Don't waste your money on it. That is the best advice I can give.\n",
      "I thought this game looked like it would be great-- but it turned out that it was boring, irritating, not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new, and this game would crash every five minutes. A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon, and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it!  If you are interested in this game, I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead, it's a lot more fun, and it doesn't have bugs- don't waste your money on Sim ThemePark!\n",
      "Ok,I'm a HUGE fan of Sim-stuff ... I can't get over how clever they are, how real they play out, how absolutely consuming they can be.This product is not one of them.It's awkward, it's punchy, and buggy. It  restricts your creativity in a way that I've yet to experience in any other  Sim game. You are limited to two island scenarios to begin, and they are in  themes like Dinosaur, and Space Ship ... and they are VERY tiny -- not much  to work with.  Creative-wise, you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme -- IE: your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaur's stomache as one of the rides. *shudder*I think the game is  ideal for children 10 and under. It's fun and quirky enough to entertain  them, but it's not what you'd typically expect, as an avid adult player,  from a Sim game.Try Roller Coaster Tycoon if you're an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software (but even that gets a bit dull after  a while -- it's easy to win and repetitive).Or try The Sims, it's quite  entertaining, and very well put together.\n",
      "This is the Worst Game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the 2nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it don't waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but i've never been able to use it since its so messed up\n",
      "first in the series by blizzard. not something I would play nowadays but this was a very interesting rpg back in the day when I had been a gamer.\n",
      "Hope you like backtracking cause you'll be doing that allot in this one. I bought this game at a yard sale for a buck$ and I still think I got ripped off. This game has no strategy, none. The controls suck, whatever happened to up, down, left, right? Guess the developers at Blizard entertainment thought that is just way to convenient. I have no clue on how this game got so many good reviews over the years. This game is for anyone under the age of 14 to like it. You can't just fight a boss head on, (like they do in games that were actually worth playing), no you have to run behind a door or somethin' and cast a spell until he's dead. ... Yeah, I know, as if a boss doesn't know on how to open a freakin' door. Another thing that got me was when your backtracking outside some kid just outside of this underground church that goes ten stories down. The kid has some info on a place or a location or somethin', he charges outrageous prices, like if you want a sword or somethin', it's $4689.  WTF! Ya know a nickle use to go a long way in the 1920's, this is like 1400's, Whats he fixin' to buy, a castle? I don't what my dollar back, I want the 8 hours I wasted my life on playing it.  So don't buy this game, no matter how little of a price they want it.\n",
      "I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS GAME AT ALL! IT WAS WAY TOO FANTASY-BASED! DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE GAMES THAT ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY REALISTIC!\n",
      "Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played. Sure, terran  marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are  frustrating. You have to right click(why not the usual left-click?) to  select units and you cant deselect them. Building times are extremely long-  and so are the units. Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow( on a  Pentium II 400, voodoo3, 96mb RAM). I have only got up to the third terran  mission then finally gave up. And whats up by only controlling 12 units at  a time? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on  screen.Starcraft's ingame graphics aren't that good, FMV qualty is terrible  and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and  few options. Westwood online gives the player more options and is also  faster. All in all, i say the command and conquer series is better - go  play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C&amp;C game - SC isnt worth  your time or money.\n",
      "{YAWN} Very boring disapointing game. Terrible gameplay, graphics, bla bla bla. The cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate. At least the music is kinda good. I don't recommend this for any god damn gamer. =[...\n",
      "The game will not load on my Mac. The box says its supposed to. This was a very big disappointment. I was trying to get out of the shooter games.\n",
      "Hey, maybe I'm doing something wrong but, I haven't been able to get this game to do much of anything... the graphics are poor for this day and age and the controls were even worse... I didn't play very long though, so it's not fair to say it truly [stinks]... Maybe I'll try it again and see if I missed something...\n",
      "Awful! A real disapointment. This game is confusing and boring much like civilization 2. The game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was. I bought it a while ago from Rinho and it was bran new then. I was sooo dissapointed. It takes forever to play, the battles are cheesy and a waste of time. If you are considering buying this game, I reccomend you try it before you buy it. Belive me it's not even worth $5. I've always been dissapointed with Sid Meier's games. So I think I'll stop trying them. If your considering this game, try Imperium Galactica 2. It's awsome. No comparison. I hope you found this reveiw helpful.\n",
      "I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel. It's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes, but what's worse is that you wouldn't want to! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game. Where are all the catchy tunes? I can't remember one line from this game, whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper's songs memorized. It's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite: &quot;Sunny in my life, she's like a dice, I can't tell which way to turn 'till I spice!&quot; Skip UmJammer and get Parappa.\n",
      "It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it \"best game of all-time\" or \"best Castlevania game you'll ever play\".I don't think so.  If you want a \"real\" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.You're probably thinking by now \"Alright, talk about the actual GAME!\"  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.\n",

Don't bother.  It's been a while since I even had my Dreamcast hooked up, so I don't remember what it was that I didn't like about the game.

      "People saying this a perfect game are either skateboarders are just crazy.

      "horrible graphics, mindless games, hnow the heck did u give it 5 stars???\n",
      "A lot of good reviews--two perfect 5 star reviews even. Amazon.com gets to choose which reviews are \"featured\", so that's not really much of a surprise.You should definitely read more reviews. The graphics are okay, but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many. Bright oranges, glowing blues, and odd color assortments await you in this game. Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone. That was a game I played so many years ago I can't even remember when, but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good. The story made more sense, the missions didn't tell you exactly what to do (you had to figure it out, which was the fun part), and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time. To summarize what these reviews (on the first page) are all leaving out:- You'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly. Because the drivers of other vehicles just aren't smart enough to do the job themselves. You'll also have to do this to access the tactical map, the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there (by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed, too little, too late)- Missions aren't involving, and the story doesn't continue from the original game. In short, there's really not much of a story, as you'll find yourself doing strange things that you've been ordered to do for no apparent reason- Interface is cluttered, buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things, and it's a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle. In many games, the only deciding factor of whether you'll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enough\n",
      "I got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile. It blows it is a boring extremely hard game. I liked the movie option, graphics and real car phisics. The story was okay not great. The controls were horrible. The missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring. The first mission took us 3 weeks to fufill. Also your stuck in the car driving around. The missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path. It's not even challenging fun. It is more like boring impossible!! Also you can't see in front of you. I'm still on the first city. On the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies. Also there are driving games like pursuit and Getaway, carnage, surviver and time trials ect. There fun for a while you can also turn them into movies. Also I think this has much improovement from the PS1 version by far. But still this game is horrible. The story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving I've ever seen.

      "This rumble pak is too big, uses up batteries rapidly, it's so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble, Nintendo should have built-in rumble in thre controllers this sucks.\n",
      "I rue the day this title came out for Playstation. It was considered so original, it influenced many, many stealth-type games that followed it. Too many.Where do I start with the things I hate about this game?1. It's way too difficult. You get awfully sick of hearing \"Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!\" every 10 seconds. There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me. \"Easy\" mode really isn't.  Sheesh.  I wonder what \"Hard\" mode was like.2. Way too many cutscenes! I've never seen anything like it. There's one cut scene that goes on for like 30 minutes. This has got to be the talkiest video game I've ever played.  And these dialogues are all so silly, and you're pretty much forced to watch them or you won't be able to understand what's going on. In fact, I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes. It's not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons.3.  I hate video games that won't let you pause at certain moments, as this won't.  I wouldn't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who's gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen:  you'll find yourself saying, \"Yeah, I'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour!  Not allowed to pause it for some reason!\"4.  Even more excusably, there's not way to pause the cutscenes.  You can't even pause the codec dialogues!5.  There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didn't, the scene would be too easy.6.  There are far too many boss monsters.  It's like every other encounter is a boss monster.  The first part of the game (say, up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot) is pretty great, but that's not representative of the game:  after that it's basically an unending series of boss monsters.7.  Frustratingly, you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die.  Having to \"kill\" the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you're going in circles.8.  The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down. Was this written by a 14-year-old?9.  The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time:  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didn't mean to do this.  This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still, allowing your enemies to shoot you.  It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L1 or something.10.  The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody.11.  The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices, such as the thermal goggles.12.  The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you:  you can't look ahead because your radar is \"jammed\" and then you get shot by a security camera.  Or blown up by a mine.13.  The way you are prevented, after having killed a boss, from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didn't collect during the battle.  Is it there or not?  So why can't I get it now?14.  The absurd anti-nuclear message at the game's finale.\n",
      "I read lots of great reviews for this game that made me want to play it.  It will not play on my XP.  Talked to a lot of other gamers that tried to help but nothing worked.  Am holding onto it in case I can get a chance to play it on another computer.  I don't think it is XP compatible.\n",

I mean it was like watching your  units walk through glue because the game slows down so bad, it took my  little army of 30 units 15 minutes to reach the enemy base! Also 3D  acceleration for this game is non-existent! In the original TA the computer  cheated, but it wasn't to an extream sence, here they made it ten-fold!  Whenever you aren't looking over the enemy's base, they make units in 3  seconds or less, they can make thousands of units with only one lodestone  in place! its ridiculously IMPOSSIBLE in skirmish(when you are just getting  your defences finished they will have those plus a 30+ army coming to  attack your base) and just plain weird in campaign mode. Do not buy this  game, buy the original TA, its WAY better, trust me. Avoid Kingdoms like it  is a urine cup used to serve apple juice!\n",
      "I got this on sale and decided to have a look based on its low price and 5 star rating.  What a joke!It's like Starcraft with bad graphics, zilch instructions and awful controls.  There are better games out there that are free!\n",
      "While the curse began with \"Cartoon Studio\" for many Simpsons fans, it began with Virtual Springfield for me. Now, I'll began by saying that this is one of the worst designed game ever. The developers attempted to use the \"Kids game\" excuse, but they even fail at that.Using myself as an example, I first got this game when I was seven years old. At this particular time in my life, I was EXTREMELY easy to please, but this game couldn't even achieve that.The first and instantly noticeable problem with this game is that it is choppy and poorly programmed. I first played this game on a poor PC, but I later got a high end PC. I decided to give this game a second chance and I discovered something in the process. The game is choppy because it is poorly designed and programmed, not because my old PC was bad. If you were to look at the requirements, you could see that is is VERY low. The high end PC I had contained specs at least 5-10x higher than the requirements, yet the game was STILL choppy.And it's not just some parts of the game, it's EVERY part. When you turn, when you walk, when you do ANYTHING, you will notice the choppiness. That is, of course, assuming you have 20/20 vision or are wearing your glasses. Then again, you might notice it either way.The next and the second most noticeable problem is that the game has no substance. There are very few things you could do and the few things you could gets boring quickly. For example, the main thing you will be doing is simply exploring Springfield. This is all nice and good, but what happens when you explored everywhere? Absolutely nothing. The game ends there. Of course, you could also collect cards, but it is so ridiculously easy that you can probably finish by the time you're done exploring. Hell, at the time I first got this, I couldn't solve ANY kind of puzzle, yet I did it anyway. In addition to this, the few minigames that are here are simply terrible. They were made to only take your attention for a minute or two. There are freeware online that are better than these minigames.Now, Virtual Springfield has already committed two of the the worst possible crimes for PC games (bad programming and no gameplay), but to make the whole package even worse, it's expensive. At the current time of this review, the lowest price offered for this game on Amazon is $10.99. Selling a game THIS bad and that you could beat in less than one day for anything higher than $3 should be a federal offense punishable by 50 lashings.Overall, it is a terrible game that has once again proven that the old saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\". I had thought that since this was a free roaming Simpsons game, it would rock the casbah, but I now realized my mistake. Don't make the same mistake I did.\n",
      "all u do is walk around springfield and look at things, it is good at the start but then after u have looked at everything it [stinks]. there is nothing else to do.seriously, i am a HUGE fan of the simpsons but dont let the amazing tv show make you think that this game is good. its not. dont make the same mistake i did in buying it, you WILL be dissapointed.\n",
      "This game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head, but not by much. A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission. It went like this:  Me: &quot;Where am I? Is this a wall or a door? I'll just open it-&quot; Guard: &quot;Hey!&quot; Me: &quot;Oops!&quot; Guard kills me. The End.Wow. That was fun. Hoo-boy!\n",
      "After all the years and all the hype I expected that this game would have *something* to recommend it.  Sure, I realized it wasn't going to be the GAME TO END ALL GAMES.  I always make sure to discount 25% for hype.  But,  my gods, what a poor showing this is!There is next to no innovation.  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake, the puzzles are of  the annoying &quot;find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack, etc&quot; style.  The sense of immersion is zero.  The  sounds are poorly choosen.  The enemies are, for the most part, utterly  uninspired.  The load times between segments (which uses the Half-Life  formula) are ridiculously long.  It's also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment.Well, you get the point.  If this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from $20 on the  discount rack, maybe I wouldn't feel so annoyed.  As it was, I went back  and exchanged it for &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; which, well also not  ground breaking, is solidly entertaining and, at least, mildly  innovative.Please, folks, don't get sucked in by the hype.  Save your  money for something better.  In the meanwhile, I'll be hoping that Ion  Storms next big product, Deus Ex, does a better job of living up to its  reputation.\n",
      "&quot;I am only left asking, &quot;how long until Daikaitaina 2? &quot;&quot; - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!I really tried to like this game.I felt like screaming &quot;Turn the lights on!&quot; during the first level. What a murky morass. I installed this game twice and I still can't stand it.What angers alot of gamers is this: We wonder what games didn't get made because &quot;Daikajokea&quot; sucked up so much cash?\n",
      "Daikatana is to computer games as Battlefield Earth is to movies. The plot is one-dimensional and does not let you stray, even to the point of letting your supposedly smart teammates (read: more of a hindrance than a help), keep you back. If a man can't figure out how to walk in a straight line across a bridge, why should I trust him in a fight? Additionally, the enemy AI is alternately idiotic or lethal, with little balance between which road is taken. The weapons range from the interesting to the downright Twinkish. The program itself drains a system of precious resources to accomplish what most other games can outdo with less programming, and with better results. This is a game to avoid. For a truly good game experience, stick to something with more plot, better game engine, and more developed player-to-AI interface.P.S. That One star should be 0, thats right zero stars buddy.\n",
      "I am going to make this short but true.  First off this game is HARD or at least what I played. this game is no Shoot them all like Quake 2 or anything.  I found this game Repugent.  I don't even want to try it again.  I don't care if you have 1000 weapons, if you can't beat the first stage  with Ease, then forget about the rest.  The Graphics in this game are  Dated back to the DOOM age.  This 5 year opus did not pan out like I  wanted.  I really thought John Romero actually had some skill but it seems  not.  The game might have good points but the save system (save only if you  have a crystal?) is an abomination.  This is a horrible idea which is seen  way too much in Console System games, but never should have made it to the  PC.  I admit Ion Storm Made has made a killer game (Deus Ex) but this one  is just a pile of turds.  Bargin Bin Box.  I also just want to close with  this.  We can now see the real genius behind Doom, and Doom 2, was John  Carmack, not John Romero.  Sorry about being rude and mean, but this game  is really horrible, and I just want to be honest.\n",
      "Dont ever, ever buy this game! I knew it was going to be bad. So far this game beat the record for the shortest stay in my hard drive, even beating Trespasser by 2 days. A game that took 4 years to develop, well, you know  something's not right. Lets start with the graphics. Really very dated  OpenGL graphics. If this game came out 2 years ago, it would've been  awesome. Interface: No In-Game save. Only way to say your progress is by  picking up Save Gems. No Gems, no save. Control: Ok, so it's like any other  first person shooter which is why I gave this game it's one and only star.  AI: very very bad. Talk about having your AI teammates to back you up.  You'll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you. Also,  there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake.  Story: just watch the old TV series &quot;Time Tunnel&quot;. Overall: spend  your money on another game.\n",
      "I have little patience when it comes to games like this.  Makes me wish I hadn't bought it and I am still trying to get rid of it.  Before buying take mine I will mail it to you before I hurl it through the wall.  EGM  said this was a good game and usually they are right.  Well they blew it  this time.  Don't get me wrong it might be fun.  Good concept, interesting  story,  Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss  fights.  I never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until  I died 50 times in a row.  O' YE OF LITTLE PATIENCE AVOID THIS ONE!\n",
      "the game its self was good but the ending was such a letdown i had fun playing it making the girls mad but the ending was just so bad that it killed the whole game for me i played 40 hours into it\n",
      "Never before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play.The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that, my friends, is a sad, sad thing indeed.The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all. Heck, I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.I love GTA. It's a great game, but why does the '88 NES Super Mario Bros. have superior graphics to a PS1 game from 1999. It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself.I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from Rockstar.\n",
      "Given that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this (cough) classic I decided to give it a second chance.Let's see let's put it through the test.Graphics: 1 out of 5 (it fits on the Gameboy Color, that's pathetic for a PSX)Sound: 1 out of 5 (fairly decent sound effects, bad music)Controls: 1 out of 5 (these are the worst controls ever)Fun Factor: 1 out of 5 (I still returned it the next day)So there you have it.  This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again.  Word of advice, buy a PS2 and get Grand Theft Auto 3, you will not regret that financial investment.\n",
      "Do not buy this game. Seriously. People might try to tell you it all great and dandy, but as a very heavy gamer, I think I can honestly rate it as one of the worst games I have ever played.The graphics were terrible, even for playstation, the difficulty was ridiculous and through the roof, your teammates were slow and stupid and the enemies all shot far more accurately then you could.The difficulty was even backward, from everything I have read on the game- easy was hard and hard was easy. It was like the game wasn't even finished.Now the game might not be that bad if it just let you relax and stealth through a mission. But, no, every map has an absurdly short timer, forcing you to run headlong from start to finish, shooting wildly at everything around you, trying to get to the end before your team gets slaughtered or the time runs out.I only ever managed to beat the first mission once- and im pretty good at shooter games- but the second mission was only that much worse.I have a rule, that I keep every game I own (rather then trading it in) forever and ever because you never know when one day you might want to go back and play it again. This is probably the only game I've ever owned that broke that rule. When I think of what the worst game I ever played was, this is usually what comes to mind.The sound was terrible, the graphics were terrible, the controls were terrible, the difficulty was terrible, the TIMER was terrible, what little I seen of the AI was not impressive- teammates killing themselves like always- and even the lighting was terrible, forcing you to stare at this strange vista of green and black all the time.You want a playstation one stealth shooter? Try Metal Gear Solid, or syphon filter, or anything. Anything at all.Please, I'm warning you, don't buy this game. Not even for 1 dollar, because it will only tempt you into the torture of playing it. You will get far more pleasure out a dollar double cheeseburger anyhow.\n",
      "Looking for rise off of naked blue men with green capes reminding you of your hero to save you. Well this game is for you. I first got introduced by one of my friends I mean an acquaintance. His favorite games soon showed me that he really wasn't all that bright. He said (In a gay womenly voice) \"Hey try this game out.\" So I said hey what the hell. As I took it home I hid it away so no one would see it. So I popped it into my Playstation and even it rejected it. So after a couple of trys it finally ran. So the title screen appeared...I never knew this was an alien/vampire porno flick. The idea of impailing naked green \"Slaughs\" as their called in the game isn't my idea of a thrill. After killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy. Wow now I know im scared. Then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds (one retarted...another more retarted) is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sh*t. Answer me this: If a vampire/gay alien, has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk? Its amazing!! \"Feed on the balls of your enemies\" \"Explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet!!\" The main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire. His arch enemy is another vampire but is about...I don't know a billion times better then him (Just a rough estimate). The most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo. WOW THREE HITS!! Then press x to dodge/lunge and triangle to impale. Oh the complexity. My mind strains over this sh*t. Well if you like to get off to blue alien like men...Go for but I suggest you don't waist your money.\n",
      "Take a game made by someone else, change it, use the Tomb Raider engine, add some nonsense and you have the so-called LOK series.The only game in this series worth mentioning and playing is Blood Omen, the rest of these are Tomb Raider Engine based made by someone else (not Silicon Knights the Creators).\n",
      "I really wanted to like this game. I wanted to play it ever since I got my Dreamcast. After many delays, it finally came out, so I rented it. Thank God I did. I'm sorry to report, but this is a horrible game. But why? Here's why: 1. The Graphics. While they're certainly not the worst I've ever seen, they really leave too much to be desired, especially for the fact that this is a Dreamcast game. You can see the polygons sticking out of the characters and they don't look real at all. I've seen N64 games that look better than this. Heck, I've seen Playstation games that look better. 2. The Controls. They are the worst part of this game. Using the X, Y, B, and A buttons to move isn't bad, but on default, A moves foward and Y moves back. But that's not all. With almost unuseable menus and 37 commands put into the Dreamcast controller, it makes the game a REAL pain to learn and makes it barely playable. I can assure you, the controls are much worse than they sound. Plus, the loading times are too darn long. But there's a good part to the game. The sounds are very good and draw you into the action. But that's it. I was hoping for a good spy game like Goldeneye, but on Dreamcast, but I just wasn't that lucky. Don't bother wasting your time with this piece of junk. Instead, skip it and go immediately to Perfect Dark. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.\n",
      "The absolute worst Dreamcast game I have ever played. I would not even take this game if it was given to me for free.\n",
      "I bought this game because I had lost my original and I wanted to play it again. The day I got it I played it for 3 Hours! I had so much fun. Then the next day I wanted to play with it again. But when I went to play it, My data did not save and I thought it was maybe because I played it on the Gamecube. So I took out my gameboy color and played it again. I played and then saved. I turned it back on within 5 minutes and it said my data saved so I thought my problem was done. But then I turned it back on within 8 hours and everything again was deleted. I tried to play it on my Gameboy Advance SP and it did the exact same thing as the Gameboy Color. I just contacted the Buyer to see if I could get a refund or my money Back. I am pissed that it didn't work and I wasted my money on it. But I am sad too because I love this game and I wanted to play it. Make sure your game saves before you play it for 3 hours :(UPDATE: I did receive a refund for the game back on my Card. I paid shipping and Handling to send it back.\n",
      "I had this game a while ago. I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version. I liked being able to play a girl, and to get a cat, and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good in-game profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites (all other HM recently, I've noticed you NEED them...I'd rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do it)...but I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game.And thats not the worst of it...This is a 'real time' game, and after a while, either it decides you're not playing enough, or the time system just breaks...either way, unless you play it almost nonstop, it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you.Its good fun while it lasts...but it doesn't last long enough to even win it.\n",
      "I love Mortal Kombat. I really do. I have always been a huge fan of the franchise,but I am very sorry to say,the MK \"adventure\" games sucked.  Is there anything good to say about THIS game??? No. Nothing at all,of course. It's just as bad as MK Mythologies and MK Shaolin Monks. ...maybe even a little worse than those two. The gameplay is absolutley awful. It is unplayable! The controls will make you wanna throw the controller through your TV screen. It's almost impossible to control Jax,let alone fight. The storyline is about how Jax and Sonya have to go after Kano,or some kind of bullcrap like that. The graphics are eye-aching. Just terrible. Bad gameplay,bad controls,bad story,bad graphics=very very bad game! The konquest modes in MK Deception and MK Armageddon were more fun and better than this!\n",
      "I'm ordering this game on super NES on Ebay. It's only $3. I heard it was good so I want it. I'm also buying Ultimate MK3 and MK Annihilation. It's only $5 all together. I'm SO MAD that Baraka isn't in it. At least Kung Lao is in it. I like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee. Nightwolf's friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers. I like Sindel's animality. I am SO buying this game.\n",
      "First of all...let me say,that I am a HUGE MK fan,but oh my god...this game sucks! This is a TERRIBLE version of MK3.The fighters move VERY slowly and it is SOOOO HARD to pull off a single special move...let alone a fatality!!! The sound is terrible,the music is all muffled.Although the graphics are decent,this game is a komplete letdown.If you want a great MK game for the Game Boy,pass this piece of krap up and buy Mortal Kombat II instead.It's A WHOLE LOT BETTER!!!\n",
      "I don't know where to begin. This is, like, the worst game I have ever played in my life. The graphics suck, the gameplay reeks, the sound is pathetic, and on top of it all, the characters are given no respect whatsoever as they are designed badly and their moves don't work the way I, them, or anyone would want them to. If you like Mortal Kombat(like I do)stick to games like Deadly Alliance and Deception. I mean, Mortal Kombat Advance was crummy, but it was three times better than this piece of trash. You want the true MK games. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON AN INSULT TO THE SERIES SUCH AS THIS!!\n",
      "This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4! The graphics are awful,the sound and music is ear aching,and the gameplay is beyond hideous.This plays just like MK3 did on the gameboy...like total krap! Actually,it may even be worse than MK3! Avoid this at all costs!\n",
      "Just give up, this game is so bad i dont how it got a seal of quality. Its MK3 remade. choppy terrible graphics, horrible sound, moves, and everything else. I can't even tell which character im choosing!! You can tell they put noo effort into this game at all. If you want a fighting game try street fighter alpha on Gbc, and stay far away from this!!!\n",
      "Okay is this a April fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in 3D what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk4 in 3D that just puts the other ones to shame. so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks don't even buy it i don't recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game that's why i gave it 1 stars\n",
      "This game is not the version I remember. It feels very clunky and the load times are hardly tolerable. Try another version for your MK3 fix.\n",
      "I first bought this game in a Hastings book store a long time ago and I've been a Mk fan for quit some time, so I went ahead and bought it thinking \"This is great! I've got MK trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it. And Midway makes really great games.(LOL) And I managed to find it in a five dollar bin. This is truly a lucky day for me.\"Until I played it....Then as time went on, I kept it in my basement, and then one day I decided to bring it out because I hadn't played it in a while and I forgotten all of the moves. So I went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so I can get the feel for it again. Then I remembered why I put it the basement. What I should have done was bury it in the back yard, never to see the light of day again.As soon as the first round said \"FIGHT\" I might as well thrown in the towel. The game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou I was 99.9% dead anyway, I mean, what the F is the point?!I don't even think the skill level even works.The only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as Kintaro, (he's your best bet.)If you play as Motaro you will get your a** handed to you literally! (Pun intended).  The A.I. actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen! But if you were to uppercut the A.I. Motaro, he only staggers, can't have him flying into the air, oh no, that would require fairness in the game.MK has been known for the (copy and paste) routine on characters, and MK Trilogy is the crowning achievement of it. The male and female ninjas, and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at Wal-Mart and calling them cyborg ninjas, you know this is a cheap a** game. What the hell was this game made off of, a 50$ budget? I guess Wal-Mart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off sale.If the Matrix was to take a glitchy $H&%, I'm sure that it would look something like this. I can actually hear my PS one groaning as it loads the next game, and that happens every minute. If that PS could talk it'd say; \"Oh god, please get this F-ing virus out of me!\" Hell I think that a virus would actually improve this game, sense there's little it could do to F-up an already broken a** game.I can see now why it was in five dollar bin, but I remember that there was a trash bin next to it, and if I knew then before I bought it, I would have said; \"Hey, this is in the wrong bin.\"Its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag Dan Fordan's big fat head keeps popping out saying \"Toasty.\" I wouldn't be a damn bit surprised if I saw Charley Sheen pop-out of the corner and say; \"Already got your money dude.\"And when it says on the back of the game. \"Seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death.\" That's you, your the opponent. The A.I. will make sure of that.As for brutalities, who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes? Wow. I never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before. Apparently Ed or one of the designers of this pile of $*#& game, doesn't know a damn thing about the human anatomy. Its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves, now this?To sum it up.The game play was awful.The A.I. is cheap.Glitchy as hell.They copy and paste the characters as they always do.The option menu is useless.The video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potato.The audio is average.And the story sucked.Forget water-boarding. Forget Guantanamo bay. It doesn't even come close to torture compared to this game. S*#$, force a terrorist to play this game for 8 hours strait, and he'll tell you on how to cure any form of cancer.I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless you want to yell at your TV screen all night.\n",
      "Mortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games.Those being of course,Special Forces and Shaolin Monks.The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place.I guess you could call it a pre-quel.The gameplay is absolutley terrible.The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game.MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences.As many have said,this game is extremly difficult.Hell,I had a VERY hard time beating it,with cheat codes...and with it being on very easy.All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies.There is also puzzle solving as well.Most of which will have you pulling out your hair.Overall,This game is crap and you shouldn't waste one dollar on it.Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as well.\n",
      "This controler stinks.  The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle (so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up), the rubber grips fall off in the first week, and worst of all, it's confusing.  I tried programing the buttons (because it's &quot;fully programable&quot;) and believe it or not it works!  sure you can't train whole sets of commands (like moves in fighting games) in, only replot the buttons but it works.  The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden, none of the buttons perform the X action.  Then, this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine.  Enjoy!:(\n",
      "It's pretty simple, here. Ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with Ultima 7. So you want three games if want old-school Ultima: Ultima 7, Ultima 7 Serpents Isle, and Ultima 8. The rest of the titles are just garbage, and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable. Is anybody really buying this? And will your PC even play the older titles? And would you even want it to? They're bad. I mean, really, really, bad.This is a nostalgia purchase, nothing more. It is to witness the evolution of RPG gaming, but definitely not to empty your bank account doing it.Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 Serpents Isle are still great fun to play; Ultima 8? A little less so, mostly because it is smaller in scope. This is where the Baldur's Gate Series began, which eventually spawned the Elder Scroll Games, so there is an historical component. Still, it's just not worth this price. I might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again (maybe). Yeah, maybe.\n",
      "I used to love playing Quake 2. I played it for hours on end. When I heard about it's impending release in 1997, I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out. And what did I do when it did? I played it AT LEAST 3 to 4 days a week from 1997 to early 2002. And guess what? I became freakin sick of it! I do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth!! (Well, at least for 10 years or so) My point is, after you log hours and hours of gameplay, it starts to get old. FAST. Quake 2 may be a legendary game but I warn you don't overindulge. Play Max Payne, Deus Ex or Unreal Tournament 2003 instead.\n",
      "I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, but this ain't no FF VII\n",
      "Before you get all jumpy about the Five Star Reviews for this game, read this.  I've been playing Final Fantasy games since 2 on the Super Nintendo (4 in Japan).  At this point, I've beaten IV-IX...Some of them up to 3 times.  Anyways, my point is don't buy this game.  If you play all the other Final Fantasies with their memorable soundtracks, developed characters, unforgettable plotlines, etc and then play this, you'll wonder what you just payed for.  The only thing this game has going for it are the graphics and pointless cinemas.  This was one of those games where I would &quot;pretend&quot; that something good was going to happen..You know to make me feel like the game was worth playing.  Nope.  The characters are insanely dull and just can't make up their mind.  One second Squall hates Rinoa and the next he &quot;wants to be with her the rest of his life&quot; and all that garbage.  Love story..yeah right.  The soundtrack is nothing that you'll remember like the other games and the plot is just so...confusing?  I still have NO IDEA what is going on in the last cinema.  I mean the game just jumps to places with no explanation or reason.  One second I'm protecting this fisherman's town, the next I'm in space and then I'm going to the future.  That's another thing I don't understand.  How will killing Ultimecia in the future affect the present?  More horrible storyline I guess.  Also, Ultimecia just comes out of nowhere.  She is the &quot;third mage&quot; who comes out of nowhere.  She says like 4 lines in the whole game and really isn't evil or spooky.  Like when I played FF VI and Kefka poisoned the Kingdom of Doma...that was a true act of evil among many.  Also, when Sephiroth killed Aeris in FF VII, I at least felt like she needed to be avenged.  But Ultimecia is just some chick who needs some english lessons.  That is all.\n",
      "Good gravy... This is the absolute worst game that I have ever played in my entire life. Not that the game was even that bad, but... It never lived up to its own hype. I have played all of the Final Fantasy games... Since I beat the very first game, I have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic. I cherished IV, and I absolutely LOVE VI, which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music. And Final Fantasy VII blew my mind... The Final Fantasy... In a whole different perspective, with three dimensions on the battlefield. When FFVIII came out, I already had a copy reserved... I held the glowing package in my hands, looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics, and in my head I could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to. But as my best friend and I put the disk in and beheld Final Fantasy VIII... There was a voice screaming in my head... My mind kept saying something to me over and over again as I walked through Balamb Garden... And then my friend said that very thought: &quot;Jay, this game sucks.&quot; Yes, it does. This game is a disgrace to the series. A storyline that is so slow, so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences? There was no Final Fantasy VIII Theme! The battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the FFVII Score. There was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey. The disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the CG movies. The character development was never there. Never did we ever find out why Seifer was such a jerk. ...Or WHY the GFs (Ha, ha) erased the memories of the characters. The lead character, Squall, answered every single question with the word &quot;whatever.&quot; Compare that to the strong-willed, heartbroken Cloud from FFVII, and it becomes obvious. Allow me to say one more thing: Final Fantasy VI gripped me. I captivated me with a spell that bound me. I played, played, and played that silly game, with it's cute 16 bit graphics, as if I were possessed. The same goes for VII. I wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment. I got as far as the mission to Timber in FFVIII, and never gave it a second glance. Only a year later, after exams were done in college, with no car or friends around... Did I pull Final Fantasy VIII out again to give it a second chance. How sad. The only time I ever cried over a video game was when Aeris died in Cloud's arms... But when I first played Final Fantasy VIII, I know that I wanted to just bawl.\n",
      "Good gravy.  What was Squaresoft thinking when they made this one?!  It's terrible in almost every aspect.First of all, the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities.  This means that if you use them, your skills actually decrease.  Not only that, but because the maximum level your characters can reach is 100 instead of 99, you're actually susceptible to the nervewracking \"Level 5 Death\" spell.Secondly, the cast is shallow and characterless.  The main character is grumpy and unsociable, and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to.  Also, none of the other cast are very memorable, like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games.Lastly, the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of... well, you get the idea.  The story begins all right, but then lapses into a nauseating, mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rival's ex.  Not only that, but the main character's attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the \"villain\" is really after; they never give you a deep enough look at her.So, really, if you're a Final Fantasy fan, skip this one.  You didn't miss anything.\n",
      "The Game is sow Boring the story is not good at all final 7 is so much beter get that ...\n",
      "What a poor excuse for a Final Fantasy game, this game should have never came to america. Sure, the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a Baby Sitter's Club Book. The main character Squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst, please. Oh, and the magic system (the draw and juctioning system- great idea... ahahahahahahaha. If you want a GOOD Final Fantasy get 7, 9,and 2, or 3 ( 4 and 6 for those people who think that they know Japanese.) Just stay as far away from this game as you possibly can!!!!\n",
      "ok, I admit if I known how bad this game was I still would have bought the game, but I wish I would had waited until the game went down to $19.99 before I wasted almost $50.00 for it. I hope Square makes FF9 better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap  shoot.Now for my reasons for the 1 star.1. It was a rip off of FF7. if you want to get FF8  but havent played FF7 get FF7.2. Why no voice acting!  I sooooooo recomend it!  C'mon Square at least on the CG movies(pease let FF9 have voice acting)!3. The characters in the game not just the playable  ones but all of them seem to have no life to them, its just boring how the characters are so dull, I just cant  explain it.4. Rushed, rushed, rushed, and, rushed. C'mon  Square where is this quality gaming I remember from your other stuff like Chrono Trigger and old classics like that.5. I dont have anough time to tell you the rest but there  is alot of other stuff.\n",
      "Could have been a lot better. to put it simply, to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan ever,me, i was totally diappointed by this game. i hate the whole modern/futuristic look that this game has. even ff7 had this to a point. i want this to be like fantasy..castles, swords, mages, kings, knights, wizards. i hate that there is no armor or accessories, plus i hate that there are no magic points, and magic is not earned. the experience points thing stinks. leveling up/money mean nothin in this game.  my favorite part of RPG is building up wrecking machine armies.  ergo my sabin, celes, edgar, and terra army from ff3/6.  in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up.  this game is soooo dumbed down.  the villain or lack thereof is horrible.  BRING BACK KEFKA!  the gf's take like 20 years to finish making battles so annoying, instead of fun like in ff6 and chrono cross.  the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking.  plus every character is essentially the same, each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks. maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy 8 i woulnt have been disappointed. this remains the only ff game ever that i havent finished, i stopped playing on disc 3. if u want a good RPG to play, get FF9 which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great. also i recommend ff3/6 which is undoubtable the best FF game ever, and arguably the best game ever. i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games.  dont waste your time or money with final fantasy 8.\n",
      "I am the type of RPG gamer who likes to chop heads off, burn down castles, pillage villages and slay dragons.  I don't like to go to Macy's or Talbots and buy a blowdryer so I can fight the next cosmo-monster.  This one sucks.  Final Fantasy should go back to its roots and deal with a true story, like FF3, FF7 or FF9.  The ending was a confused mess- good graphics, but what were the storywriters for this ending smoking?  I am not chauvinistic, but this is one chick-flick game if there is any.  Not for head-chopping, castle-burning, dragon-slaying guys like me. One star for the Square title and graphics.\n",
      "If you want yet another dogfight game, here it is.  If you want a game where you feel as though you are commanding a starship, as depicted in the Star Trek movies, you had better pass.  Cut scenes?  Wow, impressive, and  with David Warner no less!  Graphics? NONE BETTER!  Neat way to blow stuff  up?  Oh, yea!  A great game for those under 30 with cat like reflexes.  No  cunning needed here.  However, you had better be more practised in an  immelman turn than the corbomite bluff if you want to suceed at this game,  and that precisly is the opposite of what is advertised.\n",
      "This is rapeing the Quake name now ID.......Get the Quake 1 magic and actually interesting story of Quake 1 back.  Quake 3, 4, and 2 suck.\n",
      "Absolutely the worst game in the excellent Quakes. This certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay. What I hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you don't have to think. Getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires! This game is just like UT, bad. Utterly bad! I have constantly tried to like it, but failed at every attempt. Avoid at all costs!\n",
      "Wow look at the pretty engine. THere I have said everyhting good about this. I swear progreammers are more interested in pretty than contenet.  I would rather play Doom than this.  Quake3 is all glitz and no depth. Where  is the story? Where? It left with Romero when he went to form IonStorm\n",
      "Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only  1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the  game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are,  Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first  game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE!  And you know what's worse?  This Nintendo 64 vertion looks WORSE and plays WORSE than the Dreamcast  vertion!  Now that's sad (Even though I never liked N64).\n",
      "This game is Civ II meets D&amp;D. Its horrible. One of my five LEAST favorite games.\n",
      "It sure does. Old, boring, hard to play and hard to control. This game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much. And the price when it first came out! Sheesh! I'm betting that the only reason some people buy this is Lara's chest and that does'nt justify purchasing this accident of a game.\n",
      "I played this a lot when it first came out, when my computer of the time had win 98.  It was a fun game and still would be to play again.  But I cannot play this on my Windows XP or 7 PC's.  Its full of glitches that are impossible to fix.  To play it you'd have to skip levels because, for instance, you get to a point where you cannot make lara jump to a ledge she needs to get to to continue.  Then you skip a level and this happens again.  Like i said, unplayable unless you maybe had an older comp-i don't know why the game will start and run but then glitch in the middle of a level and i don't know if there is a fix because i've never seen a game do this.\n",
      "Before buying this game, I strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first.  As a fan of many of the &quot;God Games&quot; out there, I found this one very unintuitive.  In short, all of the people are  stupid and the game itself does some very dumb things.For instance,  there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown  as the Nile River rises.  The question isn't &quot;what's causing this  person to just sit there&quot;... the question is &quot;why is this even  occurring?&quot;That's just one example, there are many, many, more.  Another example?  Ok, I got to a point in the game where half of the  population would just leave.  Then, six months later, they'd all return  again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year.  Does this make any sense?I found all the micromanagement to be very  tiring.  The object of the game isn't to build an empire, it's to figure  out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what  they should be doing without any thought.This is just the demo, folks!  I strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the  real deal.Derek\n",
      "If you like clicking banners and advertisements off your screen you will love this game, cause thats all it is, clicking annoying flying/popping graphics off your screen.\n",
      "wow. i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games( which is clearly evident in games like, starcraft, warcraft, diablo)well i bought this game, and it was stupid. this is what i affectionately call a \"clicker\" game. you know, i left click on you,i hit you, i right clic on you, i do a magic thing. boring. they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing, but the fact that it'll always be the same thing, every time you play it, doesn't really give you much re-play value. also a killer is the mandatory quests,you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot. if you really want a real RPG, buy Baldur's Gate, it's cheaper, and you get to completely make your character, and there's a totally non-linear plot. do waht you want, or don't, but be prepared to suffer the consequences. Baldur's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control, while diablo 2, you are just kinda along for the ride. diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers, who don't really like the whole variable plot thing,the ones that don't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to, the ones who just want to click their way to victory. this game gets one star, which is many , many more than it deserves\n",
      "At first, I thought this game was good. The graphics are not very visually pleasing but the lighting affects were very nice. There were several different characters each with their own abilities and such. But with each waking moment I grew more and more bored, and my mouse grew more and more worn out as all I basically had to do was point at something and click like crazy till it was dead, not very entertaining. To add insult to injury, the monsters I was encountering were pretty much the same old beasts with a new outfit on, and maybe a different attack or special ability.Sure, there are tons of collectable items, and Blizzard claims that the items you wear change your appearance (A half-truth as boots, gloves, and jewelry do not show up on your character). But you can only do the same thing over and over so much. The game's &quot;quests&quot; from what I've encountered are basically you go here, kill this boss and come back. Sure, there may be a few things you need to do, like a grab an item from point a, an item from point b, and put them in point c; but the basic premise still stands.The game has it's merits, they did spend a great deal of time making the full motion video cut scenes beautiful (ala SquareSoft), and there are alot of items, and the areas are fairly sizable, and the load times are next to nil (since the entire game is on your hard drive instead of on the cd like diablo 1).The install process is slow and requires you to swap several disks including one with large movies on it (you should have the option of not viewing movies in any game). But the uninstall takes mere seconds. Which leads me to believe the game doesn't get fully uninstalled. I also hear the multiplayer is very fun (which can make the worst games great).What honestly kills the game in my opinion? The constant need to click the mouse in a rapid fasion (the alternative is to hold the button down, which is just as bad), and the repetitiveness (which is also a major flaw in Phantasy Star Online).If mindless clicking is your cup of tea, then by all means pick up a copy today. But otherwise save your cash.\n",
      "It IS point and click!  Yeah, the greatest RPG of all time!  It certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other RPG.  All my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing.  They are all now one with the chair that they sit in.  Greatest RPG?  Not even close.  Those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now.  I observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths.  The only thing that moves is the hand, making quick, convulsive movements.  I say that even if it does expand your brain (Ha, ha), the other negative effects far outweigh the good.\n",
      "Point, click, point, click, point, click.  Need I say more?  Incase you missed that it was point, click, repeat.  THIS GAME SUCKS!  I doubt the expansion will be any better.  I guess if you are twelve and you get your rocks off by having super items and being able to kill anyone in the game then it's sorta fun, but where's the challenge?  It took me ten minutes to master this game!  I cannot say enough bad things about this waste of money.\n",
      "It's unfortunate that you have to buy these cards second hand now.Sony will do anything to make you buy newer versions of their PS-3.that have had constant complaints from customers.There are a lot of Very Good PS 1 GAMES OUT THERE,AND YOU CAN'T PLAY THEM WITHOUT THE MEMORY CARD.wEITE TO sony AND COMPLAIN.\n",

      "NES is the best ever, SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible.  I enjoyed Doom 64, WCW/NWO games, MK Trilogy, Goldeneye, Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible.  The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day.\n",
      "Thanks to Nintendo's bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the 32-bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems, we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there.  True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and  bad third-party support, no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it.  And I hate Playstation, but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N64.  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system, they also had to turn many classic 2D games and  turn them into horrible 3D games (Like Earthworm Jim 3D, Zelda, Donkey Kong  64, Kirby, Rayman 2, and so much more...)!  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it.  Sometimes the controll's bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game.  Plus because the games are in  cartriges (Lousy sound and space because of this) they cost [a lot]  and the games are usally short and don't last more than a couple of hours  before you're finished with the game.  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made.  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing (I still think once was too painfull) at a friends house.  Complete waste of money.  I do not recomend.  Let's hope the Nintendo Cube  Box turns out better than this piece of trash.\n",
      "This is argubaly the worst system EVER. The music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation. There are no good RPG games for  this system. The graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and  overall a pathetic system. The best game it had was Goldeneye 007 and in my  mind that is the ONLY good game besides Perfect Dark to appear on the  entire system during its 4 years on the American Market.\n",
      "As a Myst fan I looked forward to this game and was sure that since it was so difficult to find in my local store that it must have been great. Boy, was I wrong. I played through and found that the puzzles were pretty difficult simply because were totally unrelated to each other and the rest of the game in general. Running a PII 600 MHz machine the game gave me no problems and the graphics ran fine. I am not an extremely picky gamer and with a bit of a plot this game could have been tolerable. ... .\n",
      "After playing this game, I have yet to see any of the \"stunning 3D graphics and animation,\" as movement causes the graphics to merge with an extremely grainy texture. In fact, the landscapes were poorly rendered and did not impress me one bit. If this game was released about five or six years ago I might have been satisfied, but since then I've seen and played a lot of games, both good and bad. Control is lousy because there are only a few selected paths on which you can travel. I should be thankful I only paid $... for this, otherwise I would be extremely unhappy. NOTE: The only reason I gave this game one star is because amazon wouldn't allow me to give it zero stars.\n",
      "Okay, maybe not. But it's the second-worst I've ever played, Entombed (a $3 game so awful that Amazon doesn't even have it) having worse graphics and even more nonsensical puzzles.STORY: WEAKWho is Ozgar? Who are the Arkonians? Why do they hate each other? Why does Ozgar hate you? Is Ozgar really Darth Vader or does he just act like it?These questions, alas, shall go unanswered. I don't think I'm willing to buy the second game to see if there're any new revelations.Graphics: MediocreAm I unique in not liking when when the resolution is better during movement cutscenes than when you're standing still? I don't think so. \"Wave that picture around, I need to get a good look at it.\"PUZZLES: What?Much too simple and uninventive. What is all this stuff and what's it for? If I can figure out a code simply by trying random combinations, it's too simple.ENDING:You get one screenshot. It doesn't even move. That's your reward for slogging through this awful game.REPLAY VALUE: Why?If you're really bored- and I mean REALLY bored - maybe you might see how fast you can run through it or something.

My stepdaughter tried to get it to run on her even newer computer, but found it froze up every time. Disappointed and dissatisfied.\n",
      "Now let me tell you straight that Rayman is one of the best games I have  ever played!  With wonderous worlds, challenging levels, and memorable  charicters make it a game to be hold!  That where Rayman 2 comes in.  Gone  are all the great stuff I mentioned above, clearly a fatele mistake on Ubi  Soft's part.  We have none of the returning cast (Except for Rayman of  course), choppy 3D graphics (A lot of the graphics look like they were  painted on the game), and very little challenge makes this a tradgity!  I've had this game for little over three days and have unlocked all the  secrets AND beat the game!!!  The first had me playing for months.  And  when I was finished with it I shed a tear of joy and said: &quot;Now THAT  was a game!&quot;  I'm still wondering how this can be called a sequal,  it's terrible!  I'm truly offended by this game!  All those who praise this  game have probibly never played the first game!  I beg of all those who  read this reveiw, please play the first game first to see what Rayman truly  has to offer you!  This game is just a wasted game.  I hope Ubi Soft wises  up with Rayman 3 or I'll just have to shelf the game as &quot;A game that  got killed, when turned to 3D.&quot;  Boo, hoo!!!\n",
      "First let me start by saying I have nothing against this game. It is a classic and I recommend it to anyone who loves video games. I gave it one star because of the computer compatibility.If you have anything above Windows ME or maybe even XP, do NOT buy this game. It will not even start on your computer. If you want to play Rayman 2, go to GOG.com and buy it for a few bucks. They make their games compatible with newer operating systems.\n",
      "Get it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suck,boring gameplay(I usually like realistic military games), coudn't acess campaign, takes forever to install.I would give this game 0 stars. I just bought it about 1 hour ago played it for 15 min. and then got bored... Try the Unreal series , half life or rainbow 6\n",
      "I bought this game at a fairly low price, and when I started playing, I was totally amazed - at the incredibly bad graphics.The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars, placed above and below it. That was the first thing I noticed. Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy, and my gun wasn't all that impressive either.&quot;OK...,&quot; I said to myself. &quot;Why don't I try walking around and see if this gets any better?&quot; So I did. Guess what? No gun sway! Every stinkin FPS game I've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun (Ok, maybe not Wolfenstein 3d, but still!).So, anyway, I tried firing the gun - barely any recoil at all. I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not.Anywayz terrible graphics = boring game. Enough said\n",
      "I own this game.  I have gotten a 5 star rating once but it is dumb because if you run out of money and go into debt you can't get your money back or build anything.  The people get impatient and stressed out and then they start taking your money away.  I would recommend that you buy Spider Man or the Spider Man Movie Game instead of this annoying game that never ends.\n",
      "Looking past the buggy engine and gameplay, the game is incredibly inconstant with previous Ultima games AND itself. The Avatar has to has...What a paladin is...this is just EA squeezing the last bit of promise from this game....One of the Avatar's Companions, Sir Dupre...for 4 games...Was a Paladin, and he sacrificed himself in the Stead of the Avatar in Ultima 7. That one line of Dialog killed the game for me.Don't waste your money and get one of the Better Ultima games.\n",
      "It is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows XP. You can run most of the features, but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature. You need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles. I wrote to them a while back but they showed no interest in providing a fix. I guess they made their money and don't care.\n",
      "The controls are hard to use, it's almost imposible to order your units to attack enemy units because they move to fast. The 3D graphics are terrible and the sound is mediocre. The game says you can play multiplayer on 56K or better but you realy need DSL or something. The so called tricorder is imposible to use. The missions are way to hard and you can only save at the end of your mission so you'le end up playing for hours trying to finish. If you want good 3D strategy dont look here.\n",
      "My God, if this is a game, it needs to be called Destruction Derby because of all the crashes.  My computer is WAAAAAAAAY above minimun specs for this game, and I experience crash after crash.  The fact that there is no in game save option really [stinks] also because you have to start the mission over after your game crashes.  The only reason this game got a star was because the graphics and movies are cool, but as far as game play and interface.... it [stinks].  The game isn't hard, it's just time consuming, and gets really frustrating when you have to restart you computer every half an hour or so because of the crashes.  Don't ask interplay if you there will be a patch out soon either, they won't respond, lately they have just been shoving games out on the market half finished and then not providing help to the customers who bought the games.  I know I'm not the only person experiencing these problems because I bought the game with three other people and they have them also, and feel the same as I do.  Quite frankly this is the last game I will ever purchase from them.\n",
      "As I'm unable to \"fully\" review this game, let me just say, the game is not compatible with WIN XP.  If you are lucky (or foolish) enough to still be running Win 98, then you may be able to get the game to load.\n",
      "I'm giving 1 star because this is one of the cheapest packages I have ever bought, it looks like a pirated copy! No, wait, a pirated copy would look better!!All the disks came in a single case, onve over the other (which caused scratches in almost all of them),Oh and all the cool covers on the disks? horrible black and white labels!I regret buying this!\n",
      "Okay, here it is in a nutshell.  The graphics bite, and bite HARD.  The spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable.  And there is little if any help by the  GMs.  My two cents.  Buy at your own risk.\n",
      "This game should have NEVER been released in its current state. Its load times are unacceptable. Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation. Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1. This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6. FF5 freezes very often when you try to save. Also its load times are long. Not to mention this is the original translation of the game, so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game. FF5 just butchers the English language. FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times. It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever. The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience. Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance. Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology. LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time. Shame on you square soft, shame.\n",
      "I don't like this game. It is terrible. Terrible graphics and the fact that you can't use the joystick makes it harder to play. This is the worst james bond game I've ever played. I'm returning it.\n",
      "When I was taking this game to the checkout line I anticipated a great classic on par with F Zero X but what I got was a complete waste of money.Talk about a disaster this game was just like one huge train wreck.Not fun at all and the graphics are some of the ugliest most bland landscapes Ive ever seen.This game is an insult to the N64.Instead get Ocarina Of Time,Perfect Dark,Super Smash Bros or F Zero X.Pass on this.\n",
      "Would have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together.  By the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves - awful!  Plus multiplayer is just a &quot;fastest-finger&quot; question to determine who plays solo.  Big deal!The worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup.  This is on an Intel PC with name-brand components, no cheap swap-meet stuff.  The only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game.  A visit to the Disney Interactive site for tech support... umm where is it?  Because of this I can't recommend anyone purchase this game.They've come out with a second edition of this game (wow, so quick?)  Perhaps this version works?\n",
      "When Millionaire first was on in the summer of 1999, I was thoroughly addicted. This was novel, new television. Now, of course, it's repetitive and boring, but for a while there was really a spark there.The computer game, however, always.... It hogged memory, was hard to control, and wasn't very much fun. It's sad, but the online free version at ABC.com was a lot more fun. I generally don't like games where there's no flexibility and very little fun, so if you're like me (and I would hope so!), avoid this one!\n",
      "Man, I never knew Phil Regis could be this ANNOYING!  Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard (which is totally unlike the show), and it gives you 30 seconds to answer the question (which is ALSO  totally unlike the show), I have to restart the game A LOT, which means I  hear Phil Regis A LOT.  A &quot;skip&quot; button should've been put into  the game!  I haven't recieved any repeat questions after about 3 months of  owning the game.  How?  I uninstalled it after 30 minutes and never played  it again!  Trust me, you'd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee  cushion than this game...and it's $5 cheaper!\n",
      "I am 15 years old. This is my first review (out of about 30) that is a 1-star review. And I have 18 (give or take a few) reasons why I hate this game so much:1. After the first game, the questions started repeating. The game is basically the same 40 questions over and over again.2. You can't skip the introduction. I know it's not too long, but you'd think that with today's technology there'd be an option to skip it.3. Regis is appallingly rude. Once I won nothing and he said, &quot;Welll, there you go. Don't spend it all in one place. In fact, don't spend it at all. Put it in the bank! In 40 years, maybe you'll be able to afford a marble or something!&quot;4. Once a $200 question appeared later as a $32,000 question. Um, that's not good.5. The questions from $100 to $1,000 are too difficult (compared to the show). For example, the show had a $1,000 question that was &quot;How many legs does a spider have?&quot; But the game had a $1,000 question that was &quot;What kind of object is a 'ginsu'?&quot;6. Once again, Regis is appallingly rude. Once I won $1,000 and he said, &quot;Not bad, But at least you should've known the last one. Come on! Or at least you should've GUESSED better!&quot;7. Regis only says &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot; whenever he wants to. Most of the time, your first answer IS your final answer, even if you happened to hit the wrong button by mistake.8. There's a ridiculous time limit of 30 seconds per question. I've seen people on the show take as long as 17 minutes.9. The Fastest Finger mode is a joke. You're supposed to hit a letter key when you think the four answers are in the correct sequence. You don't actually put them in order.10. Regis is appallingly impatient. If you take too long on certain things (like the Fastest Finger mode, or saying how many contestants will play), he'll say, &quot;This game is over! I'm outta here!&quot;, and the game quits on you. Yep, you're back to Windows! And guess what? Once you load it back up again.....11. ......you'll have to sit through the introduction again!12. There's a general lack of options. When you hit the Escape key, you bring up the option menu, and you have these options: Volume Up, Volume Down, Resume, Start Over, Quit. There's no way to make the questions easier or harder, and there's no way to skip the introduction.13. Speaking of which, when you select Start Over, the whole program starts over. Yep, you'll have to sit through the introduction again!14. Once again, Regis is appallingly impatient. If you take too long to write your name, Regis will say, &quot;Come on, it's not a big deal&quot;, or &quot;This isn't a trick question, what's your name?&quot; If you take too long, he'll type whatever he wants (e.g. Kathie Lee Gifford).15. When you use the Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, Regis calls one of HIS friends and they start chatting a little before they get to the question. Then he'll say to his friend, &quot;I've got a question for you&quot;, as if you're not even there. I mean, come on, it's YOUR lifeline, not Regis's!16. What's wrong with having an option to use the mouse?17. When you say &quot;yes&quot; to the instructions, Regis only gives them to you once. This is especially annoying in the Fastest Finger mode, in which you're pretty much doomed to load the game up again once it quits.18. Did I mention that Regis is appallingly rude and impatient?Well, there you have it. This review pretty much goes to ALL the games in this series (19. The makers were kind enough to make more than one edition of this trash). One of the few redeeming qualities of this game is the CD has pretty art on one side. That way, the CD makes a colorful, if fragile Frisbee. Aside from &quot;Treasure Mathstorm!&quot; and all the other &quot;games&quot; in that series, this is the lamest excuse for a game I have ever played. And that is my final answer!\n",
      "This is the most meager cash-in attempt I've ever seen. There may well be hundreds of questions, but it'll take you a thousand games to see them all. I was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game, and a  majority of repeats by game 10. There seems to be little or no gradual  increase in difficulty, which was proven when I saw a $500 question later  repeated as a $125,000 question later in the game.An example of the  game's inadequacy runs thusly: I am cruising through the game easily until  the $32,000. Fine, by now I'm expecting them to be tough. I use the 50-50,  then the call a friend, who says she is 75% certain the answer is (A). Just  to be sure, I use the audience poll as well. Guess what, 92% say that (A)  is their choice. Well, now I'm convinced and go with (A) as well. I'm  WRONG, it's (B). That is just stupid beyond measure. If they wanted to  throw me off, make the audience rating more like 60-40% or  something.Nice graphics, nice sounds, atrocious game mechanics. Wait for  the improved version, or play it on the net.\n",
      "Believe me, I would give this game zero stars if Amazon.com allowed me.I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you.  This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market.  I mean, the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isn't very high.  If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force: Landwarrior.  Your time would be better spent with those games .\n",
      "I have to admit that I never was a victim of the &quot;Tomb Raider Hype Machine&quot;. I liked the idea of a 3rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the big-boobed Lara Croft just turned me off.  I bought this for 4 bucks at the used software house and played it for about 2 hours. I liked the save game feature somewhat, it should be more specific. I felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the 50th time because I did'nt hit the &quot;jump&quot; button in the right sequence with the &quot;run&quot; button at the correct prescribed time.  The interface is just too rigid for a game like this, it reminded me alot of that old &quot;Dragon's Lair&quot; game. And I got real tired of the stupid puzzles.  I think the real reason for TR being so popular is that its the first non-adult game with a overly-endowed female protagonist. It can't be because of the gameplay.\n",
      "I heard this game is crap. I have it for NES and its cool. But this is weird. Why would they make a stupid 'easy' game for GBA? Why won't they let you play as the cool people like Baraka? You stubborn retards can make a better choice of system and game then this!!!!!!!\n",
      "Well, here it is guys: the WORST Mortal Kombat game of all-time.  Yup, the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II.I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time.  I was very naive (all my friends were right!)Time hasn't been kind to this game, but who am I kidding?  Time wasn't kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then, and it's trash now.  It will forever remain trash.  It's so trashy, the trashman won't even take it.  He says it stinks too much, and it's not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor *just* to put the game in the back of his truck.  Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world, he doesn't want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently.So why am I bashing the game so hard?  Because you get fewer fighters, fewer levels, HORRIBLE black and white graphics, and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate.  The blood doesn't even exist.  Okay there's blood, but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen, would you even call that blood?  No, you wouldn't (and shouldn't).I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day, than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again.  It's really that bad.  At least then, you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun.For the love of God and all his wonderful adorable Earthly creatures- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  Just when I thought the Mortal Kombat series couldn't get any crappier, it happened.\n",
      "I only payed $3 for this game at a used game shop. I was very mad when i got home because it wasnt even worth $3. There is nothing good about the game. The graphics such even for the sega genesis. The sound is the worst. The controls are sloppy. The gameplay sucks so bad you wouldnt believe it. Dont but this game even if you're a batman fan. Stay away from this game.\n",
      "This is just too bad. For such a cool character, Batman has had some bad luck with video games. This is probably the worst and that's saying a lot.  This game is no fun (did you see the one star?) and is not worth anyone's time.\n",
      "God, was this game awful. I played this game a while back and I got frustrated with the controls. One of the biggest gripes I had with this game was how the fighting resembled Mortal Kombat's style. Then again, it was made by Acclaim, the same company that did the Mortal Kombat games. Batman performs leg sweeps, back kicks and even uppercuts, just like MK. This fighting style doesn't belong in this game. It just slows things down. You'll also have trouble navigating through the levels as the foreground will block your eyesight, which makes seeing what you're doing a hassle. If you're a Batman fan, you'll be disappointed with this game. Neither version of this game is good. Stay away from *gulps* Batman Forever.\n",
      "This game is a joke.The graphics are pretty cool,because they are digitized,but other than that,the game totally blows! Batman is just some fat guy dressed up in a Batman costume,and the guy playing Robin,looks like he made up his costume,out of cheap used clothes that he bought from a thrift store.The sound is awful.The game play's like a Mortal Kombat rip-off.It's just a bad game.If you wanna get a really good Batman game for Genesis,pick up the original \"Batman\",based on the Tim Burton movie from 1989,and just stay away from this waste of time.\n",
      "Batman forever was a game that wasn't even worth spending money on buying it those pour kids parents paid 50 bucks when it just came out and when they took it home to play it i bet you they said they spent all that money and it sucked this game was worse then Atari 2600s E.T. and that was the worst game ever made so you ever gave this game 5 stars i mean i like mortal kombat to but this game should be thrown in the trash with all the other garbage because it gave batman a bad reputation\n",
      "when i was a kid, i thought this was fun, but i played it lately, this is so boring and dull\n",
      "This game sucked big time you couldnt do nothing in it when you wanted to and was so hard you died after th first few shots and i was using a game genie for this game the first terminator game was better.\n",
      "THIS IS THE VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3 THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID. THIS GAME WAS HORRIBLE AND IT MAKES THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION LOOK LIKE A GOOD GAME IN COMPARISON. THE GRAPHICS ARE AWFUL, THE MUSIC IS ANNOYING HERE, THE CONTROLS ARE BAD, AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A 6 BUTTON CONTROLLER FOR THE SEGA GENESIS, YOU CAN'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING!!! THIS IS A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT TO THOSE THAT HAVE THIS GAME ON GENESIS. AVOID THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS. THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. THIS VERSION JUST RUINS THIS SOMEWHAT DECENT SEQUEL.\n",
      "This game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible. Back in the early 90s Genesis was the blistering fast system. As per the SEGA gargon. Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but couldn't handle the colors. So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial. Now we are stock with this thing. They kept most of the moves and all the colors, but doesn't have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done. Before you defend this game, think of this. Super Street Fighter looked great, but they they just didn't take the time porting this game. And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab, choppy, and well peiced together.On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out 32X. It is one of the best ports out there. This is one of the most ported games of all time, and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it was.\n",
      "Looks and plays nothing like PC or arcade version and the moves are too complicated.  Get MK instead. Terrible.\n",
      "I hated it, and I'm an rpg fan. Maybe I should of gave it more of a chance but the controls felt clunky and whilst trying to get to the next locale I would get shot down in flames.But I also have terrible reflexes so and little to no patience for slow text which this also has.\n",
      "I remember burrowing this from a friend because I ran out of N64 games to play so I burrowed this and some other games for a few days. I have to say it was fun at first, than it became frustrating, and than I felt like I was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which I didn't intended in doing. It was also because I was really young then and I really didn't know what the game was really about, which is puzzle solving sometimes.I advise not buying the game, instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out. Of course you'll lose a friend, but well worth it! Game > Friendship. I'm just playing kids.\n",
      "I wish they would make a Gamecube side-scrolling Donkey Kong effort like the SNES games, just make the graphics better, retain the music quality and make more levels and longer. They included some lovely old games like the original DONKEY KONG arcade game, and a spaceman game for computer. There are big worlds, but that seems just about it. There's a lot of collecting, but the problem-solving is no fun. This series became really removed from it's huge SNES appeal.\n",
      "I bought DK64 when it first came out in 1999, and from the moment I started to play it I did not like it at all. It is way too complicated and difficult to play, and I would not recommend this game. Every time I tried to play it I just kept getting frustrated, and I had to stop playing it. Instead I would recommend Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64.\n",
      "donkey kong is a stupid game the charaters are monkeys for the love of God monkeys.this game does not have a story line do not try this game.\n",
      "I borrowed this game from a friend. I played for half an hour then got bored. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. It's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie(which I also didn't like). I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.Banjo-Kazooie was fun, until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere. Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.If you liked Banjo-Kazooie, I'm sure you'll love this. If not, definitely skip Donkey Kong.\n",
      "mischief makers?what does make you think of?teenagers who get bored and break stuff?firecrackers?practical jokes?pranks?how about............none of the above.how about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atari?no mischief,just a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip off.save your money a buy a box a paper clips.youll have more fun.\n",
      "This game was much more entertaining in it's time. I bought it a while ago played it for 5 minutes then NEVER touched it again...\n",
      "Wargods is a much better game made by the same people for the N64. This game is somewhat glitchy and straining. Save your money. Buy a better Mortal Kombat game for a newer system. Not worth having.\n",
      "blends 3 mortal kombats in one, not the first three games that i expected. game play was lame. Not for beginners very hard.\n",
      "This game is so stupid, i don't understand why people like it. There is no real fun in it. For one thing you can't jump/ wich is dumb. and the attack moves are really duel. it sucks! do not buy this game.If by any chance you liked this game then check out all of the other Bomberman games.\n",
      "I bought this game way back when the N64 was in its heyday. I thought it wasn't very good and traded it in. Now I see somebody is trying to sell it for $89.95! If anybody is considering buying Quest 64 at this ridiculous price, I urge them to think twice. There are plenty of far, far better games for your money. I know there weren't that many RPGs for the N64 but that doesn't make this game a classic IMHO. You'd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.\n",
      "Mario Kart 64 will always be the best. I don't consider myself fully biased, though. This game really is that bad.\n",
      "What can I say, this game was dumb!  It's just a copycat of Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart 64 has freakin' fun!  Diddy Kong Racing is a joke!  I would have rated it as \"0 stars,\" but unfortunately I don't have that option.  If you want to give someone a hate gift, I recommend this.  But don't blame me if they surprisingly love it.\n",
      "the graphics is pretty good on this game, but the game play sucks. it's not worth your money.\n",
      "Another lousey boring basketball game. where do they come up with these games. this game was stupid.\n",
      "what a joke, this game is worthless. I wouldn't have taken this game if it had been for free, let alone 4 dollars!\n",
      "this game sucks big time. it was boring and stupid.\n",
      "I rented this game once, thinking it might be a cool rpg/ puzzle solving. Boy- Was I wrong.  This game is very boring, and has no real point.  It is extremely hard to maneuver your character without a demon jumping on your back, or your character falling to his death. I gave up after the first level.  Whatever you do...DO NOT buy this game.\n",
      "This review is hard to write because I am so mad that I wasted my money on this game. Oh whoopie, you can play as Zero the fighter, butt zero is how much I should've payed for this game. There isn't one thing about this game that I like. The story [is bad] and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful. If you want a real game, don't waste your money on this. Don't even rent this game. This game is so bad it make Pong look good.\n",
      "it says it is in good condition but lots of scratches does not even work never played it  don't buy\n",
      "I've heard about this game Rainbow Six for years. I've always been curious about it but I haven't played it till recently. I must be missing something because for some reason I did not enjoy this game very much.One thing I've always heard about Tom Clancy games from players is \"they are so realistic\". The realism is Rainbow Six is partly what drags the game down. Everything is caught up in trying to be as real as possible that for me at least, it sucked the fun right out of the game. The premise of the game is that you are leading an anti-terrorist group called \"Rainbow\" made up of the top special forces operatives in the world. But from the outset the game is bogged down in tedious details. Mission planning is unncessarily over complicated. I spent maybe an hour planning a mission that my team was wiped on in under 3 minutes. It seems that three quarters of the game is spent in the planning stage. Selecting team members, equipment, weapons, mapping a mission plan all seem more important that actually performing the mission. This led me to bouts of \"Oh come on!! I just want to play the game!!!\". The online play doesn't fair much better either I'm sorry to say. The average online game is about 30 seconds in length and I was frequently shot in the back after the first 5 seconds. After which I was relegated to watching the other online players. Also the problem of veteran players racking up stats for some game \"leagues\" by preying on lesser skilled players is rampant. Unfortunatley there's not much that can be done about that.The controls fair no better. The control scheme is complex to the point of frustration. Other teams just stand there waiting for you to give them \"GO Codes\". But they are more like ducks in a shooting gallery. Being picked off one by one till you are the only player left. There is an option to remap the keyboard controls but that unfortunatly doesn't make things any easier.The graphics look a bit dated but the game ran very smoothley on my computer.Rainbow Six is a game that has a really good idea but falls horribley short in its execution. It's needlessly complex and overly tedious. If you are a Playstation 2 owner I'd recomend SOCOM: US Navy Seals over Rainbow Six. For PC I would recomend Operation Flashpoint. Both are alot more playable and more enjoyable.\n",
      "This was the most boring game I've ever bought.  Don't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you.  It's one game that you go through with various times with different characters.  The valiant  effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent.  It's tedious  going through the same mini-quests over and over.  Most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full game.This was a  good idea, playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played, but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more variety.If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time.  It will be much more interesting.\n",
      "So i bought this game, and when i recieved it, it was tucked away in a paper envelope, just the disk and nothing else.....and lo and behold, when i take it out, it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable, so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it, i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at $25. I might review the game when i actually play it, but don't buy it without a case, make sure when you order it, it comes in some kind of protective casing, not just a disk in a sleeveActual Game Review: Duke is still the man, even todayScore: 5 out of 5Ok, the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour, so i decided to try antoher one, and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hour.....and it's just as awesome, the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive. Graphics wise it's not that bad, but it's a PS1 game from 1996, but graphics don't make the game, look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil, and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two. If you're an action game fan, a Duke Nukem fan, or just want pure action, big explosions, bigger guns and Duke with an even bigger ego, check this game out.\n",
      "As the other reviews have stated, this is a very boring game. You are Batman or Robin set out to save Gotham from the Riddler and Twoface. An interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like Mortal Kombat, high punch, low punch, up to jump and select to use your grappling hook. When you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs, gas guns and baterangs. There's not much to the game, you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys. The graphics are pretty amazing, being that the game is so much like Mortal Kombat, so are the graphics!\n",
      "Please do not make the same mistake I did buying this game.  The game play is terrible, graphics are bad, and there are tons of the gliche's.  I tried to resell and its worth 25 cents.  enough said.\n",
      "Doesn't match the pic and I don't remember any mention of this by the seller, Again European version. I'm sure it would work on a European SNES.\n",
      "Why do I rate this game 1 star? There are several reasons. First and foremost, there is NO SAVEPOINT. In short, you'll have to beat this game in ONE SITTING. Talk about patience. The second major problem that I have with this game is that it is trying to do too much. It is a top-down shooter AND a first-person shooter. The graphics in the top-down mode are fine, but the graphics and textures in FP mode are DREADFUL. Doom has FAR better variety, texture-wise. Personally, I got headaches after playing in FP mode after 30 minutes--and remember, you can't save. So the bottom line is this, if you want to kill dinosaurs, I'd recommend Jurassic Park for the old NES and the Carnivores series for PC. N64 has a Turok the Dinosaur Hunter series out. Pass this game, you'll be glad you did.\n",
      "the game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didnt even work. waist of my cash.\n",
      "Please don't get extremist on me, but I don't really like this game. It's overrated and I will stick to the first Legend of Zelda that's way better than this! Newer Zelda games are NOT my thing.\n",
      "People say this game is great. To what extent? its great horrendousness? if that is the case, then yes. this game is so hard and cant be beat unless cheated after world 6, the game is impossible. just stick with sonic on sega genesis. the graphics look like the NES, even genesis is better. just dont waste time with a snes console or games.\n",
      "This is one of the most overrated games of the Mario series. First of all, it's extremely difficult and frustrating. There's always been a problem with Mario games concerning the controls, they're slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game. Also the fact that the only attack Mario can do is jump on his enemies, at least in this game which isn't enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time (armies of them). I know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this game.Another dire problem is the process of saving your game. The game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your lives.I would've given the game 2 stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for 1991 but there are so many games from the 16 bit era that surpassed it that I'm going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply don't make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else. In comparison to Donkey Kong Country and Sonic The Hedgehog 3 this game is dwarfed for its graphics. Another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kind.And let's not forget the overrated soundtrack. The music is dull, repetitive, and juvenile and not in good way. It's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didn't even do this on the NES.Now don't get me wrong, I'm a casual Nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the Super Nintendo and Nintendo games on newer consoles, Super Mario World isn't one of them because it's frustrating and it sucks.\n",
      "O.k. I'll put it out right now and bring the big guns,...combined couldn't even compete with the \"hint of mint\" of this game.Zoop was terrible. It was supposed to be the new Tetris and it turned out to be the new garbage of the day. Zoop was everywhere. It was in every magazine, every commercial and every home system yet the game still flopped because of it's horrid gameplay.You were a little triangle. Your job... match colors and shapes before a row of colors touches you ... Oh by the way, that's all there is to this game. How fun right?Of course not. Zoop was the biggest hype and also the biggest flop ever, or atleast that I can personally think of off hand. Honestly, it wasn't even worth playing. If you wanted to get frustrated all night long playing a game, then all you needed to do was pop in Zoop and then you could be angry all night long.Do not play, buy or even look at a screen shot of Zoop. It'll destroy your brain and erase all of your known gaming abilities for other games. Avoid it!\n",
      "This was a fad, where they were hoping to be the next Tetris and they came out on every system and every platform, people were hooked on matching colors of triangles with squares, then the people playing this game got bored of it and it was never heard from again. The point is that you must select a triangle from the middle of the screen and point it toward an isle of squares and shoot it off to destroy the squares. If too many squares get lined up, you lose!!!\n",
      "its boring you play a triangle trying to poke balls into a square\n",
      "In this game, all you do is line up the colors and clear blocks using the color you, a triangle, have at the current time.  If the blocks get to the square you are in, the game ends.  Another thing that gets me is that this game lacks a 2-Player Mode.  Do not even bother with this game.\n",
      "I had a friend who used to come over and make fun of me for owning Killer Instinct.  He'd constantly ask me \"when are you going to get rid of this crappy game?\" and I'd tell him \"oh, eventually\".  But it took until 2001 when the game didn't sell at a yard sale that I ended up throwing it in the trashbin . THAT is when I got rid of it for good.The fighting in Killer Instinct is even worse than in Mortal Kombat, and I didn't think it was possible to defeat Mortal Kombat in sheer crappiness.  The one thing Killer Instinct does better than MK is the combo system.  It's easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game.  Unfortunately, just like Mortal Kombat, the fighting system is severely dated and useless by todays standards.  Unless you like your fighting games to be in slow-motion along with neverending choppy graphics (with bad-looking fatalities included for additional pain- pain that YOU feel) you should never ever think about buying this game.  Just another Super NES fighting game I hope people can't remember.\n",
      "He's a basketball player, yet Shaquille O'Neal made it so big with his basketball career that he thought that he could expose his name in the mid 90's.Shaq Dieselanyone? That was hilarious. Now look what Shaq came up with: a fighting game. Just by having the biggest name on the front of the cover tells enough what the quality of this game really comes out to.The video game consists of bad punchline dialog before the fights, a plot that's just predictable and stupid, lame graphics, and controls that are so agonizing to handle that it's just completely pointless.This game was voted one of the worst fighting games for a reason. No need to waste your time on this when there are far superior games released on the SNES with much better plots and controls.\n",
      "This was the worst fighting game on the SNES system. Even worse than the home version of SNK's ART OF FIGHTING and FIGHTER'S HISTORY. The game is not only stupid, it's easy and the characters are really lame.Granted yes, this game was released when Shaquille was really, really big in the mainstream, but after this game, notice how things started to go bad for him. After all, he did KA-ZAAM. But anyway, the controls are bad, the graphics are bad, fights are really predictable (ex: you know what the computer is going to do) and all in all not a fun game.Seriously, SNES had all of the better fighting games so I'm sure you could find one that you like because there are several to choose from. For instance, STREET FIGHTER II series (New Challengers, Hyper, etc), MORTAL KOMBAT II and ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT, FATAL FURY 2 SPECIAL and even BALLZ. Skip SHAQ FU, it's a waste of your time.\n",
      "Legendary basketball player Shaquille O'Neil is in Tokyo as he goes into a Chinese store where an old man whisks you away into another dimension where you must combat enemies like a cat-lady, a mummy and other baddies.One of the worst games of all time! this game is a complete disaster that i remembered thinking the game has an odd yet wacky concept as it has to be fun and rented it from one of my local video stores. The music is ok and the graphics are cartoony but this game has lousy controls that feel like they have been busted, you keep getting killed without a fair chance.No wonder this has been a waste of rental money for those that rented it, in fact there is a site that is dedicated to destroying this horrible abomination of a game. It's as bad as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, X-Men for NES and E.T. for Atari.\n",
      "Yes cause he's f**king you over rather ya like it or not. The controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is I stumbled upon a Dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when Shaq was with the Magic so the old man says you are the magic 1 so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger Sheets a dude from Aku Locka Polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is Voodoo Beast and the boss Sett Ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a Killer Instinct character. M Bison and Shao Khan were better Bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for 2 player mode and the bad 1 liners at the end of everty fight. Good game if you need a good laugh.\n",
      "It all happens as soon as you read the title, the acid in your stomache just churns up.Shaq Fu was one of those gaming horrors of the 90's that should have never been, just like his awful, awful movie career.I feel like my intelligence decreased after playing it, but back then I was but a mere child and I loved fighting games (as well as RPG's). As such I was easily sucked into playing any fighter that rolled out of a factory, thank god I had only rented this mediocre title.The graphics were pretty good I'll admit, but then there was Shaq to remind me that I was playing an absolute piece of crap. The characters clobber each other with puns before a battle ensues, oh dear god!! After your brain is crushed from the weight of sheer bad humor the fight starts. At this point you take a deep breath and think \"Well at least that's over...\". That is if you haven't gotten to the point where your thinking \"!$@@&%*@!!^$$#....\" and believe me I'll understand if you have.If you've lasted this long then....I PITY YOUR SOUL!! Anyways, the fight starts and it's incredibly easy...to the point that enjoyment is null and the fact that your playing Shaq Fu doesn't help cure that sudden acid reflux problem either. I beat it in about 20 minutes *yawn* (or was it *urk* I forgot...).I beg of anyone that's even considering buying this or god forbid, even playing this PLEASE!!! Your not missing a thing, in fact you'll thank me and anyone else that has a similar opinion on the matter. Playing a great 2-D fighter like Samurai Showdown or Street Fighter II is far better than having prematurely gray hair and vomit all over your favorite shirt (and being mentally scarred).If you own this game, there's an easy cure. Either melt it in a fire or throw it in the sea or anything that makes it dissapear from existance, please don't sell this game to anyone. It's an insult that this game was even made.\n",
      "Next to Sega CD the worst version of DOOM.  The graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is, the sound is decent (the one star), the controls are horrid, the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start, so all you really have is a butchered port of Knee Deep & Inferno with horrid controls.  Terrible.\n",
      "First of all, Here are the PROS and CONSPROS:Good for the people who own a SNES, not PC.CONS:really bad graphics.slower animation than PC.you can't save the game.It is shorter than the PC version of doom.Overall: 0.9This is a pretty good game, but not for SNES!Get it on PC. That version is alot better.\n",
      "not that this game is bad, but it is hard to play on Console, because PC makes everything so much easier for games like this. I would recommend playing this game, but on the PC not the SNES. 2 stars for this one.\n",
      "Trust me, the Super NES version of Super Wrestlemania is awful in every sense of the word.  The way the wrestlers *very* slowly walk across the screen JUST to deliver a simple generic wrestling move to your opponent (because the game company didn't give any of the wrestlers many moves to work with) is worse than any kind of pain you can imagine.I can't believe anyone would consider buying this game, unless they had personal childhood memories attached to it and they were buying it BACK after giving it away or something.  The one thing it has going for it is the selection of legendary wrestlers.  Once you select one of those wrestlers and actually play the game, you're in for a nasty snail-pace surprise.  So bad, so boring, so forgettable.\n",
      "Well, I guess the title for this review should essentially sum up the game. This game featured some of the greatest names in pro wrestling in the late 80's and early 90's. Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Hawk and Animal The Legion of Doom, Earthquake and Typhoon the Natural Disasters, The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase and Sid Justice make up quite an impressive roster for a wrestling game made during that era. I will concede that Bret \"The Hitaman\" Hart not being in the game is kind of a snub, but it does not matter since the game is lousy.There is the typical one-on-one match-up as well as Tag Team match-up, and even a Survivor Series elimination match. But the biggest flaw is the fact that there are no finishers. You won't see Hogan's leg drop, Savage's flying elbow, Earthquake's butt-splash or the Doomsday Device. It is just a simple finger-blistering grapple war, and no tournament or campaign mode means that there is no real reason to play more than a single match of the game, nor is there any point to selecting a character.The sound is the typical recycled grunts and slams on the mat. While the music is halfway decent, that's about the only redeeming factor. These flaws would be fixed in the sophomoric attempt Royal Rumble. This title, however, was best avoided then back in the day, and now as well.\n",
      "The fact that those two wrestlers aren't in this version of WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it.  Yoko Zuna is a big guy with very powerful moves, and Bam Bam is yet another big guy.  It's odd how they didn't include either of the two BIG guys on the Super NES.  It's not like this game has a lot of options and wrestlers anyway, so to take away two wrestlers and leave you with only six is just ridiculous.  Get the Playstation version.\n",
      "This game is crazy. In every possible meaning of the word. I mean nothing about this game make sense. Infact I'll bet you anything,in the remotest parts of Southeast Asia,playing this game is considered the number one form of execution. The gameplay is childish & cartoony. Some of the moves in the game you can't do in real life like doing a perfect piledriver on a super-heavy-weight like Yokozuna. The game speed is so fast that you think it was high on sugar. When a wrestler punches another wrestlers,stuff comes out of that guy like when you punch Yokozuna so many times fishes fly out of his pants. All the wrestlers fly so high you think they were on speed or something like that. This makes The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon look sane by comparison. The only GOOD thing about this game is that the wreslters look like the wrestlers in real life but that's still not enough to save this game. I give this \"game\" a 1 out of 10.\n",
      "I sadly remember the day when this game was released.  I had waited long enough, and finally I had the game in my hands.  I remember being so excited until about 1 hour into the game.  It was then that I realized that  this game was terrible.The graphics were nice, and the cut scenes were  above average.  The voices sounded good, and the combat was a little fast,  but adequate.But I wasn't having fun.  I realized that the game was  pretty deep, and dwelling deeper into the game's cool storyline would  require more of the bad AI, terrible - I mean HORRIBLE combat system, and  scrappy mouse driven interface.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I wished I  could just watch the game instead of play it, then I would of been  happy.I did what I had to do, and finally uninstalled it.  I thought of  all the money I spent, and went to find another game.  What a tradgedy that  a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed  product.  If your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay,  then go buy Icewind Dale or Diablo 2, not this game.\n",
      "this game is too old to work on todays OS's. After many attempts with dos-box and other emulation software I gave up.I did however get it to start...once....but it locked up and pixelated, then crashed with a fatal error.\n",
      "Hey I'm a bit of a Trekkie, but this games is something of a (terrible) dissapointment.  Is it just me, or are a lot of people trying to make money utilizing the magnificent star trek universe? Don't waste your money on this :(\n",
      "this game is awufal. it has loads of bugs, and gets slow towards the end of it. There are very few units also. I have had it for 3 days, and i am already board. Also the AI is really bad. I need to play on the hardest  setting, and it is still easy. If you want a better game for less price,  then buy Starcraft.\n",
      "Oh! come on this game isnt that easy. It is so hard. This game has too many confusing puzzels. If you looking for something Really fun try something a little easier.\n",
      "I really never understood the craze of this game. If you can get past ryu's ki blasts thdn he uppercuts you and starts shooting at you again. If you manage to make it to bison he stands on your head over and over until you die. Same with chun li. If you can get past sagats flying discs then he uppercuts you. If you try to attack guile he does his knee saber thing. Balrog gets you in a corner and stuns you with each hit and blocking still lowers your health, but attacking makes you get hit and die. The game at medium difficulty abuses the meta knowledge it has where if you punch and it punches, the favor is in the games timing and details so much that you are the one that gets hit. Plainly, the game is not fun due to a a computer tgat absurdly measures everything to its advantage to where every time you attack the game has measured and counter attacks flawlessly like a kid playing a master at chess. I hold my own in fighting games and am well versed in them, but the meta knowledge kills this game for me. # star because i honestly dont enjoy this game anymore. As a kid with nosalgia maybe, buy now as an adult, no.\n",
      "This and every other Street Fighter game ever made is overrated garbage.I can't believe how much people used to like this game.I've always hated Street Fighter.I think it was because I have always been a diehard Mortal Kombat fan,and since Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter have always been,and always will be rivals,I have,and will always,side with Mortal Kombat.MK had everything that this game did not.SF had dull cartoon-looking characters,while MK's characters were digitized and looked very realistic.SF was also more for kids,while MK blew everybody away with it's over-the-top violence and buckets of blood n gore.The gameplay was also so much better in MK as well,compared to SF II.Overall,If you want a REAL fighting game for your Genesis,get the Mortal Kombat games,and don't bother wasting your time and money on this or any other Street Fighter game for that matter.\n",
      "I know what you'e thinkin'!!  I love Street Fighter 2, especially the Champion Edition because it super cool, fun, and has the outstanding graphics for its time, great selectable characters, and fluent controls.  Thats good and all for Super NES releases, but what was Sega thinking when releasing this game on the Genesis?  Read carefully because there are two major things I find wrong with the release on this console.1. The buttons are limited.  I know that the Genesis has three main buttons other than start, but a standard fighting game has six buttons (HK, MK, LK, HP, MP, LP), not three!!  I don't know if this game is programmed for Genesis' new six button controller, but in order to use punch and kick buttons, you have to switch it up by pressing start, but that sucks the fun out of the game when you are trying to use a combination of moves to make it possible to defeat your opponent.2. THERE'S NO PAUSE BUTTON!!!  In order to make a button to switch up from punches to kicks and vice versa, they made it for the start button!!Theres absolutely no excuse for a 16-bit game to not have a pause button!If you dare to play this game on the Genesis, make sure you have no interruptions: go to the bathroom before playing, make sure your parents don't need anything for two hours, and leave a message on your answering machine that says \"I'm playing Street Fighter 2 on the Genesis that has no pause button, leave a message after the beep.  BEEP!\"What a rip off!  If you want to play the same classic game with the same graphics, but with more working control buttons and a pause button, get it for Super NES.\n",
      "This game, while a decent port from the PS version as far as a port goes, is very frustrating.  First it's difficult to learn and play, and the graphics sometimes makes gameplay even more difficult.  (BTW, it's not really scary.)  The most annoying thing for PC gamers is you can't save the game at any point.  Instead there are only a limited number of occasions where you can save your progress.  The novelty factor is no longer than as there was with the original RE (which was not as novel as the truly original Alone in the Dark).\n",
      "This game is horrible.  At the release of the movie I thought it would be fun to play the game series, then go see the flick.  I heard friends rave about this game, so I purchased it and couldn't get myself through the first ten minutes.  The camera angle is annoying, the controls clumsy, the gameplay corny.  The graphics left this veteran gamer with a sour taste.  However, if you like zombies and don't mind its serious flaws, give this one a try.  Maybe you'll feel better about it than I did.\n",
      "There should be a very easy setting. The game is much too difficult for me which makes it unplayable.\n",
      "Okay, the game isn't horribly bad.  It ran fine on my computer.  No problems with instal or starting or anything like that.  Default controls are weird but changeable.  My major drawback to this game was what was the point?  The graphic novel would have been interesteting if it was something you get at the comic shop.  I feel cheated by lack of movies.  The novel could have been made into movies and lasted a little longer.  It was short.  The weapons were cool but the bullet-time, should just have stayed in the Matrix.  The graphics were great but for a first-person shooter the game was not all that good.  When its in the [price] bin, get it.  But other than that save your money.\n",
      "This might be a great game, but I may never know.  In spite of having a P3 with 640MB of RAM and a 64MB Graphics card, this game has crashed (frozen) my Windows ME system three times in a row, as I've tried to &quot;play&quot; the tutorial.  I've been trying to download a patch all day, and the miserable connection speed eventually degrades to nothing, and then restarts (thankfully where it left off).  If it ever downloads and installs, perhaps it will resolve my freezes, but not so far.\n",
      "While this is a terrific game concept with some nice features, it is far more work than play. The core of the game is a standard 4X space empire builder, with colony management, a complex tech tree, tactical space and  ground combat, espionage, and diplomacy. But there is no centralized  display of colony status. A building must be supplied with both power and  workers in order to operate, and if it doesn't have enough of either, it  will simply shut down and the game gives you no warning or announcements.  You are forced to pause the game every few months and personally inspect  every single colony to discover these problems. But the tech system is even  worse, and has not been improved from IG1. There are three types of tech,  and so you have to have three types of labs. But you can only research one  invention at a time, so while you're developing a new hyperdrive in your  ship labs, your ground unit and colony facility labs are sitting idle,  sucking up your colony's power and workers. If you can't afford that waste,  and most of the time you can't, you have to once again personally remember  where you placed each one of up to 30 labs, go to the colony display for  each planet on which you have a lab, and turn the idle ones off, one at a  time. If you decide to develop a new building next, you have to go around  and turn off all the ship labs and turn all the building labs on again. And  I don't have room here to go into the game's futile diplomacy system, or  the sluggish screen redraw, or the constant nagging interruptions by  messages regarding random events and spies demanding orders. No offense to  the other reviewers here, but only a hardcore strategy addict with a fetish  for micromanagement could enjoy this game. I returned it four days after I  bought it.\n",
      "This game is the typical &quot;grab headlines and not deliver&quot; that I'm coming to expect from Lucasarts. This is an RTS 2 years behind in Technology. I've never understood how the Empire couldn't have a  battlefield mapped, yet the &quot;ZERO FIELD OF VISION&quot; persists in  this game. The controls are twitchy, and the graphics are can't even  compete with lower class RTS games like Metal Fatigue. I bought the game  b/c I'm a fan, but I'd rather spend my time reading the novels than play  this poorly done amateurish shrink wrapped goop.\n",
      "This would have been a great game except for the actual user interface. What a mess! Unless you are a 5th dimensional being with 20 eyes, you got lost while trying to manage the games meandering views. Locking onto troops in order to give them orders is a tortuous exercise.I gave up after two hours and uninstalled this programming mistake. This is another LA game that does'nt live up to it's promise.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! This was a HUGE waste of money. The gameplay was horrible. The way you control pac man is with a sling shot. He gets mad when you don't do something fast enough it's mpossible do stuff with the sling shot. you have to move stuff for him with the sling shot. seriuosly? how dumb. i ended up reterning it because it was so bad. Save you money and buy yourself the good old original pacman game.\n",
      "Wow. There isn't much to say about this game other than simply \"Wow\". Sarcastically mind you.Let me take you back to video game arcades in the 1980's. Namco developed a little game called \"Pac-Man\" that featured a 6/8 yellow circle that had an insatiable appetite for dots that may or may not have a specific flavor. Unfortunately there were four ghosts who weren't too happy about this Pac-Man eating all these dots so they would try their hardest to stop Pac-Man at all costs. However some of those dots, seemingly grown using some type of growth enhancer, endowed Pac-Man with an unusual power to totally eat the ghosts! Every now and then, someone would throw some fruit or a random food onto the play field for Pac-Man to devour, providing him with the ability to expand his palette a little.This is the game that became a world-wide phenomenon. This is the game that created a character that is universally recognized as an icon representing all that is great about the hey-day of classic gaming! This great sprite known as Pac-Man leads the pack in the annals of classic gaming, showing one and all where our Xbox 360 and PS3 came from.Knowing that, Namco still had the audacity to lower Pac-Man to this sorry state? To portray Pac-Man not as an iconic leader of the classic gaming era, but rather as some overly emotional twit at the mercy of your slingshot?The entire object of the game is to eventually beat down some creature made entirely out of gum. That's fine and all, but the game engine doesn't support the appropriate controls for combat of this nature let alone the simple and obvious fact that the missions really don't relate enough to put two and two together to get to a climatic battle with the gum monster. The missions just seem totally random in purpose; and this doesn't account for the fact that simply completing the main game missions only adds up to just under 50% of the entire completion rating for the game. Seeing as how annoying this game is, I can't see any reason to try to complete 100% of the game.The gameplay is somewhat autonomous in the sense that the game basically does whatever it wants until you sling a rock anywhere on the screen. Pac-Man moves in a direction continually until either something attacks him or you hit him with either a rock or a Super Pac-Ball or he just decides he doesn't like you anymore. The engine is based on Pac-Man's emotions. If you keep Pac-Man happy, he'll do whatever it is you want him to do and this is usually the only way to ensure that you complete any of the game's missions because if you make Pac-Man angry, he'll ignore your commands and ignore objects in the environment that you'll need to have to complete missions.The only real way to interact with Pac-Man to make sure he does what you want him to do is to shoot at stuff in the environment. You can make him eat foods like apples and hot dogs, you'll have to shoot at things to get them to drop from trees or to keep things from hitting Pac-Man, you'll need to shoot doors of stores (surprisingly the glass on the doors doesn't break) to make Pac-Man go in, and what's more, you'll have to shoot Super Pac-Balls at him to make him turn into Super Pac-Man so that he'll attack the ghosts when they appear.Speaking of that, another annoying aspect of the game is the ghost encounters. Essentially you'll need to fight the ghosts off so that Pac-Man will stop sniveling like a little wimp. You can't shoot at them with your normal rocks, you'll have to shoot a Super Pac-Ball at Pac-Man to turn him into Super Pac-Man. Once this happens, again, you have absolutely no control over Pac-Man. The game just makes him fly back and forth across the current screen until the time runs out and he attacks anything that resembles a ghost. This lack of control just becomes down-right annoying. It's basically a \"Day in the Life of Pac-Man Simulator\".Sometimes I get bored with trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do and just shoot at Pac-Man until he gets really mad and gets attacked by a cat near the hot dog stand. That's more fun then actually trying to finish the game, which if you did you wasted your time like I did.Then there are these stages where you have to guide Pac-Man while he's flying a hang glider or riding in a mine cart. Now these aren't that bad because there aren't too many of them but there's one mine cart ride in particular that really just blew me away with its difficulty. The game goes from being totally cryptic to virtually unbeatable in under twenty seconds and the worst part is you have no choice but to continue through the mine shaft. It took me, quite literally, two hours to get though this shaft and the reward at the end wasn't even hardly the beginning of anything satisfying because it lead to the backyard of Pac-Man's house.I really don't know what Namco was thinking with this game and honestly I don't want to know. While they did present some very original ideas to gameplay, what they got was something far from satisfying, not to mention they defamed Pac-Man's reputation. This game is no where even close to a start of becoming anything like the game that made Pac-Man famous. The game is definitely not worth the buy and should be avoided at all costs unless you're missing a piece in your SNES collection.\n",
      "ok first off NO dot-matrix gameboy title is ever worth $400.00 This outdated game was bad then, and worse now. Get your Metroid fix withMetroid Prime Huntersthe instead... for about $20 bucks!\n",

      "This is one of the worst RPG's ever in existance. Besides being easy, it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics. I think the Atari 2600's system is more advanced than this game. I mean, what's an RPG without scantly clad women? This RPG has none, except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is. And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail, and I don't see why people want them in Smash Brothers, which is a crap game as well. The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach, who is called Toadstool for whatever reason, but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars. Whatever. And the battle system is awful as well. I mean, timed hits?For a good Mario game, play Mario is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine, or the CDI classic, Hotel Mario. If you want a good RPG, for the SNES, play Dungeon Master of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.\n",
      "Best game ever, but I wanted to long to test it and couldn't return it. My game didn't work.\n",
      "I am just as aware as anyone that people do not base their opinions of popular videogames on intelligent scripting, intelligent plot, intelligent substance, and intelligent thinking, so no one has to remind me.  If they did, this \"Colony Wars\" never would've left a single draft.First of all, I too respect the abilities of developers of Psygnosis as much as anybody, and I would like to describe that respect, but I feel I have to say my piece about this game and come to my point.There isn't a single idea in this game that isn't founded on generic thinking, the thievery of other games, and on movie cliche's.  There isn't one single idea based in science fiction, unlike its other competitor, \"Darklight Conflict,\" the true hero here, a little-known and original game released by Electronic Arts (EA) before \"Colony Wars\" was conceived.  \"Darklight Conflict\" was a space-shooter, and the gameplay idea for \"Colony Wars\" merely replicated that game.Here's the story of \"Colony Wars\": \"You are a militant fighter pilot in space on the side of the rebel alliance who is trying to force the evil Emporer to his senses by shooting up his armies,\" or so says the narrational voice of an actor that sounds exactly just like James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader) during the full-motion videos (FMVs) which were made by the same company who did special effects for \"Independence Day.\"  Sounds like a direct, word-for-word copy of the plot of \"Star Wars.\"Here're the ideas of \"Colony Wars\": Large firey explosions even if they don't really exist in space because fire needs oxygen to exist and space has no atmosphere.  Black holes even if they don't exist as large red whirlpools in the middle of space backgrounds because their gravity is so intense, light cannot escape.  Spaceships even though they don't have wings like planes because there is no atmospheric friction to enable control using aero parts.  Also, they don't make loud rumbling noises when they pass by the camera lense because sound needs atmosphere.  Here, you get a future of imperialistic humans warring over the colonization and liquidation of the rest of the planetary systems in the universe for purposes of natural resources.  The mission and battle drill instruction voice is male, but it is okay for a female to narrate if limited to talking about other subjects like the options menus.  \"Space cowboys\" does not make science fiction, only unoriginal action games captivating non-thinkers.Here's the story of EA's \"Darklight Conflict\":  You are a Top Gun pilot in the middle of a dogfight when suddenly a beam of light surrounds you.  When you awake, you are in a completely foreign environment.  You realize your arms and legs have been replaced with some kind of tentacles that are biologically grafted to what appears as the console of a space vehicle.  A voice speaks in English to you, but it is not the voice of any human.  You have been inducted into the army of an alien race in the midst of interplanetary war to help defend their losing side, which is why they recruited you with your expert fighter pilot experience.  Their vessels are signified by a symbol, a four-fingered hand.  At first, you will begin with training.  The small fighterships are oval, with fins protruding from what could be their sides.  The weaponry is a variety involving weird plasma cannons.  Your ship uses an electromagnetic field to shield itself, but it consumes a great deal of energy.  You venture through the wormhole warps, and should carefully avoid the radiation waves that usurp your vessel energy during the travel.Even the name \"Darklight Conflict\" is science fiction.  I could connect some of the premise of the game with the old sci-fi film \"This Island Earth\", but not much of its premise.  In that movie, a group of scientists are helping an alien race that appear about human, so the scientists don't find out they're aliens immediately.  When they do, the aliens take them to their planet and the alien commander tells them their planet is being overrun by another planet's race, and they recruited Earth's best scientists to come up with new and advanced technology to help them survive the invasion.  Their enemies soon destroy the planet, but the ship has enough energy to return the scientists to Earth.  After their safe return, the aliens drive their ship into the sea, never to be heard from again.But, who remembers stuff like that?\n",
      "I don't know what came upon Sega when they made this so-called \"game\" (I normally refer to it as digital vomit). When you hear Sonic, you normally think \"Oh yeah, that faster-then-sound hedgehog who founded gaming with super-fast paced action!\". Sonic Labyrinth is not any of that. Instead of the \"super-fast paced action\" you get a slow and tedious maze to explore on a time limit (and not the 10 minutes you get in the normal games). When I say slow I don't mean long or boring, I mean Sonic moves slower then Mario, and that is saying something. It wasn't an accidental bug or hardware issues either. It was meant to be. If you don't mind watching your favorite hedgehog crawl around the areas, you will probably mind the other diasters. Music? Makes Atari 2600 numbers sound good. Graphics? Makes Pong look incredible. Gameplay? I would rather play Mario's Time Machine for a week then this for 60 seconds.Don't buy this, you'll never see Sonic the same way again. In fact, close this page and don't look into Labyrinth any farther.\n",
      "I sometimes wonder how people would react to this game if it did not have the Final Fantasy franchise name attached to it.I can recommend two better tactical srpg games before you make this purchase:  Vandal Hearts for psx and Shining Force 2 for the Genesis or Wii Virtual Console(I would go the latter since genesis and snes games have issues with the save battery due to age) or if endless grinding is your thing then Disgea series is another good recommendation.Not that this game is bad but I wanted the one star rating to get everyone's attention and let them know they have better options when its comes to srpgs.\n",
      "I never did get to far playing this game. I just don't get the hang of it. So I quit this game soon after I started. I like a game I can get somewhere with. I guess I didn't understand what it was all about when I bought it. Somebody else might do alright with it, but not me.\n",
      "After the disappointment of FF XII, was curious what makes that producer so well known and could mess up a frachise like this. So went back to the roots and try Final Fantasy Tactics. I think there are really some people who enjoy frustrations in games and think that this is the only way to consider a game fun. Final Fantasy Tactics is annoying, frustrating and unrewarding. I don't know what's wrong with people who think that this is a great game. You think you can spend time to level up the characters to make the story battles easier? You are completely wrong. I'm stuck in a boss battle that after a 100 hours of level up you thought you have characters 30 levels higher than the enemies, you should be ok? You are wrong. The boss is so strong that despite you are 30 levels higher than them, it can wipe out your whole party in one go - despite all of them are 30 levels higher and have the best equipment on them at that point of the game. What's the point? I think I'll give up the Final Fantasy frachise for good now if the next game is by the same producer. It's not worth it at all. For people who think this kind of game challenging and fun, I think I'd rather not be a gamer anymore. If I can, I want to give -5 stars to this game.\n",
      "who is giving this good reviews? This has to be the worst RPG on PS1. Interestingly, Sony initially believed that JRPGs wouldnt sell well in the west, and they released japanese games only if they were action/ arcade games. This was the first JRPG released, and it was something of a surprise \"hit\". Its strong sales showed that there was a ready western market for JRPGs and led to the later high profile releases of classic rpgs such as final fantasy 7 and breath of fire 4.Like many PS1 owners at that time, I eagerly anticipated this game, hoping for an epic experience similar to final fantasy 6 on the SNES, but with incredible PSX graphics lol. Instead I got this horrible rubbish. Its completely generic with no personality whatsoever and includes every RPG cliche there is. Its extremely easy, with extremely simple mechanics, and also very long and tedious with endless dull battles.\n",
      "Lots and LOTS of random battles, dumb characters, dumb gameplay, graphics that would look bad on the SNES (except for the constant battles). I played this when there were no other RPGs on the Playstation and I had the flu. With so many great RPGs out now, there is no reason for this game. Actually, there was no reason for it in the first place. I'm an RPG nut, but this one is just plain bad.\n",
      "I was given this game by a friend who didn't want it anymore.  Now I see why he was so quick to just give it away.  This game is the worst of all RPG's.  Weak story, repetitive gameplay, bad music, and graphics that make me wonder whether this is a Playstation game or a GameBoy Color game.  Stay away from this at all costs.  You'll see it selling for about $2.99 at some ebgames stores.  The price is that low for a reason.\n",
      "I bought my kids each one of these at Christmas, so that they could play with their Gameboys in the car when the light was low. Waste of time and money.The light isn't very powerful, doesn't illuminate much of the  screen, and seems to suck the batteries dry much sooner. The glare makes my  eyes  hurt, and I can't imagine it's good for my kids either. We don't use  them any more. Don't bother.\n",
      "Yes,it may look neat and attractive,but trust me,it is not worth it! The glare from the light covers the entire screen ofmy GBC and makes game play impossible. And,if you try to cooperate with it,it just gives you a big headache. I guess playing in the dark is just not a good idea for now,\n",
      "Pokemon were cool, yes, there was a time when the great empire of little cuddly creature took America by storm. All 150 (as the new one's don't matter a bit) were great and were a lot of fun to see in the game. Then the franchise went down hill shelling out nothing that could be considered nothing more than drivel. I know this may be a lot for a person of any age who loves pokemon to swallow. But, the franchise is old and is nothing anymore but a waste of money. When, I first got this game I will not lie a bit, I was impressed it was a very fun game and I enjoyed owning it and being able to take pictures of various pokemon. When I finished the game though I was horribly disappointed. There were nowhere near the amount of Pokemon in the game I expected and the game really left little to the imagination (can you believe that, a pokemon game, that leaves little to the imagination?) I wish I could rate this game higher and maybe if there were no alternative it may have rated higher, but there are better games out there and I'm sorry but, I wasted my money on this game.\n",
      "I throughly did not like this game at all. Unless you enjoy being on a set track and taking pictures of pokemon with a limited amount of film and giving them food or bombing them or playing music for them and taking more pictures. Then this game is not for you.\n",
      "This game really sucks! I rented it once for five days and I played it for one day and then I beat it! It was so stupid. It is worse than mario party 3! If you are a first time game player, don't get this game. If you have been playing Games for 50 years,  don't get this game. This is the worst game ever.\n",
      "This game was an extremely easy game that you can beat in 15 minutes. All you do is take pictures of dumb Pokemon. Then when you beat the game you have to try to beat the computers impossible scores. THAT'S IT, DO NOT BUY\n",
      "If I could pick the most boring, esiest game in the world,I would pick this one. All you do is z+a=a picture. Throughout the levels you get things like bait and stuff, but unless your a serous camera fan, this game should be reccomended to no one.\n",
      "Don't get this game. It is not worth the money. Ok.. you can print the picture out but then you have to buy the pokemon snap card and it costs about $5 and it is just not worth the money. And it is to short. No plot, no challange, might as well go through your photo album, it would be more entertaining\n",
      "Strange how some people regard Grandia as the best Saturn RPG and one of the best on the PlayStation. While Grandia possesses some interesting qualities, it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game. This review will be formulaic, but it will get the point across.The graphical engine was very good. 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will. I like nuances, and Grandia possesses many. I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them. The spell effects were boring, however, and the FMV, while technically good at the time, just wasn't exciting.The music is overwrought and almost silly. The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious, as if the game is saying, &quot;Come look at me, I'm important!&quot; The compositions are impressive musically, but they feel emotionally hollow. There is one song, a piano &amp; violin duet, which I loved. It was completely gorgeous. I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued. RPGs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire 40 hour game.In Grandia, using specific kinds of magic or weapons makes you more skilled in that capacity. Naive gamers have said that Grandia's character growth system is innovative and interesting. It is not innovative, in my mind, and not interesting. Such systems have been done in 8-bit Final Fantasy games and reams of Japanese RPG with lower profiles (the SaGa games come to mind). Also, because the game is so long, you'll probably learn every spell and weapon technique about 50% though the game. Since this removes any real incentive to engage in combat, all future battles are suffocating in how boring they are.The combat is boring. This is mainly because it is incredibly easy. I didn't spend extra time advancing my characters (I tried to finish the game ASAP, actually), so I definitely wasn't too strong. Still, not a single boss offered any form of challenge. Even the final boss felt like nothing more than a ponderous standard encounter. It seems evident to me that a game cannot be exciting when there is no threat...no sense of danger or challenge. This wouldn't be _that_ bad if the battles didn't take so long. So, you get thousands of long, boring, simple fights over the course of the game. The dungeons are amateur in design, and made about 10 times more dreadful because of the combat. There's also a gauge in combat that shows when when each character will take an action. However, this does not create any real strategy because all the characters move at different speeds, so it's just a funky gimmick.The story is not bad, but it is badly told. It uses about every hackneyed Japanese RPG element imaginable, but it doesn't remedy this problem with interesting characters or compelling twists. The translation is just dumb. Sony broke it down to simple diction and pure, fatuous juvenalia. The &quot;romantic&quot; relationship between Justin and Feena is basically insulting -- it has the maturity of an elementary school infatuation. Sue is an utterly pointless character, who's involvement in the story is simple arbitrary and ridiculous. What is the creature &quot;Puffy&quot;? The game never explains. I expected some kind of enigmatic quality to the creature, with a revelation disclosing all at some point (like Nall in Lunar). This never happens. It's stupid. The voice acting is hideous. Attemps at humor fall flat. Attempts at emotional expression are cringe-inducing.The game took me about 50 hours to beat (though I tend to be slower than some). In my mind, the game is about 35 hours too long. So, expect the &quot;meat&quot; of the story to be padded with superfluous side-quests packed with obnoxious combat and torturous dialogue. I like side-quests...when they are optional or purposeful. In this game, the side-quests are neither. Adventures in a ghost ship or on a mysterious prehistoric valley might sound fun on paper, but without important story revelations or fun gameplay, it's boring. Granted about 10 hours of the game is pretty interesting. But that's a mere 20% of the game. In school, that would be an 'F'...a FAILING grade.The game is just tedious. It's boring and insipid and hackneyed to death. I'm sure there will be many who say, &quot;Grandia rulez! you lie!&quot; and give me a &quot;not helpful&quot; vote. I didn't write this to please anybody...I wrote it because I think Grandia does not deserve the praise it receives. Heed my word, and perhaps you will save 50 hours of you life. That's a long time! 50 Law &amp; Order episodes! A genuinely good RPG! Think about it.\n",

That's something, right?  Now the bad.  You walk REALLY REALLY slow.  You attack REALLY REALLY slow.  Everything else goes either as fast or faster than you.

Oh ya, and the graphics look like ....\n",
      "I don't know about the other incarnations of Batman Returns, but the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version is downright atrocious. The controls are stiff and slow, Batman himself moves at a snails pace and is frequently unable to move out of the way of oncoming enemies. The sound effects are awful and the combat system is very, very poor. Such a shame consideringBatmanwas so good. Even the music in this one disappoints in comparison to the brilliant tunes in the first game. The only positive thing I can mention about this waste of time and effort are the nice looking graphics which really evoke the gloomy, wintry feel of a frozen Gotham City. Otherwise, avoid!Graphics B-Sound DGameplay FLasting Appeal D-\n",
      "I would say that video games don't come much simpler than this bore but the likes of Pong and Pac-Man, while less technically sophisticated are still better. Golden Axe 2 is such a chore to play with no fun or enjoyment injected into the proceedings whatsoever.Again, you can choose from barbarian Ax Battler, amazonian Tyris Flare or dwarf Gillius Thunderhead as you slowly plod your way through a generic as hell fantasy kingdom, hacking and slashing at conveyor belt enemies (who sometimes kill themselves out of sheer stupidity) before you get to the big guy in a suit of armour who has taken over the land because of his evilness or whatever nonsense.I often associate Golden Axe with Streets of Rage since the gameplay in the first games was very similar (I also bought them on the same day back in March 1993). But while the SOR series only got better and more sophisticated I am afraid that Golden Axe just got crapper. It tries to be the gaming equivalent of a big budget Conan movie but comes off as no more than a Roger Corman mini-series. You've never played a game so stripped down and bland as this.Graphics D+Sound D-Gameplay D-Lasting Appeal FPros:It's a lot like Golden AxeCons:It's a LOT like Golden AxeSound effects are no more than white noise.Baddies all look the same.No point system.Very, very little in the way of power ups.No combo moves.Collision detection is poor.Music is just ghastly.\n",

Buy an Snes instead with Mario and Zelda.\n",
      "A 'fun' arcade game it may well have been in it's day, but one cannot play Moonwalker today without feeling dirty or somewhat guilty. Based on the 'movie' of the same name, Moonwalker is just as weird, bizarre and outrageously self-glorifying as Wacko Jacko himself.You take on the role of a suspected pedo, dressed in a white gangster suit, who must rescue children (hidden in closets, drawers, garbage cans) from the evil Mr. Big. Upon being rescued these kids respond joyously with 'MICHAEL', knowing that they are now safe with the King of Pop. You need to rescue all the little sprogs in every level before you meet the end-level boss. But some children are too well hidden.And who IS this Mr. Big exactly. The Jacko of 1989 fighting against a child-napper, who's motives for stealing kids is unknown in the game, seems prophetic in a split-personality kind of way. Just like in Thriller where he played a ghoulish, inhuman beast, eerily foreshadowing the future.The gameplay itself is ludicrous. As you (moon)walk across the various levels (some generic, some inspired by his 'classic' music videos) you'll encounter baddies like gangsters and zombies and your amazing way of killing them is...dancing them do death. Seriously! It's not Jesus Juice, it's Jacko Jamming! You hit the special attack button and Jacko will suddenly yell 'OW!' before strutting his lethal stuff. After which, the baddies will be vanquished somehow. After playing this game you'll be exhilarated and mentally exhausted at Jacko's killer moves. You'll be reduced to a dribbling wreck. He's so good, that even passing-by animals will join in and shake their asses. If you ever wanted to play a game in which even an innocent dog is hypnotised by Jacko into dancing Thriller then this is for you. But I don't want to know you.The music is no more than low-quality samples of Smooth Criminal and Thriller, as you should know this music follows Jacko everywhere he goes in real life and will change depending on where he is.In the later levels, if you catch a falling star Jacko will turn into a huge robot. Of course. Like in the film, I just can't get over the feeling that Jacko only included this because he wants to see himself 100 feet high. It's ridiculous and has nothing to do with anything! But in a moronic, hopelessly out-dated video game I suppose it's okay. It was kind of easy to finish too and I never really played it again afterwards. But these days, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and I can understand why no one would want to play it again.Graphics CSound CGameplay DLasting Appeal F\n",
      "I couldn't stand this game.This was NOTHING compared to S of R and S o R 2.The gameplay was super fast and it was alot harder too.The soundtrack in this game was totally lame.Once again,NOTHING compared to the first two games of the trilogy.The characters you choose from are about the same.Except there is no Adam again(which sucks big time) and no Max Thunder either(which REALLY sucks) All there is,is some old dude who is a human-robot or something.I don't even know what the hell this thing even is.Anyway,the graphics are about the only good thing that I would say this game's got going for it.Overall,I would recommend avoiding this one,and just pick up Streets Of Rage and Streets Of Rage 2.\n",
      "this controller is really a bad idea on segas part, the six button is much more user friendly especially to anyone who enjoys fighting games (such as myself) given i do own a pair of these, i never use them, use my six buttons even on three button compatable games because the only difference is you dont use the x y z buttons lol, plus on any six button genre games that incorporated the using start button to swap the threes functions you loose the pause feature, defanatly not the best controller for the genesis\n",
      "I recieved the controller on time, how ever it is not fully functional, only the directional key works, and the start button works from time to time, the other three buttons are not working at all. probaly should have gone with a replica, however i'll give it another shot and order another form another Amazon supplier.. Good luck to us all who put our money and faith into second hand material.\n",
      "Are you people stupid when it comes to telling what games are good and what games totally suck?! I love the original Doom, but this shooter does a terrible job at ripping Doom off. The graphics aren't good for their time! Hell, the Genesis has way better looking games than this. It's like when I look at this game I'm reminded of vomit. Why? Picture this: a friend has just barfed, and to make fun of the situation you try and find what the colorful chunks of vomit look like. Hell, even with the radar screen you have to literally squint to see where the enemies are at because the graphics are so horrible and ugly (come to think of vomit, if you have problems with games with horrible graphics that cause you to get sick, you will barf a storm). Plus, this game was made in 1994 and has perhaps some of the worst graphics ever. Doom was released in 1992, and the graphics still hold well to this day. The controls are crappy, the music is God-awful along with the graphics, and this is one of the worst shooters I've ever played. So whatever you do don't buy this f***ing awful game. Also worth mentioning, the graphics are so bad to point of where it looks worse than an NES game.\n",
      "I've played a lot of games that to this day can be considered old. Some of them have aged well thanks to their long lasting charms and innovations, but from this I've earned an experience: I have learned that if the opening music to the game is astronomically good, it's a bad game. Few games apply to this rule, but it is still present particularly in long forgotten manure fests like Deep Blue for the Turbo Grafix 16... and this game.Right out, the game starts with an incredible opening song, one that sounds catchy, jazzy and dire all at the same time. Then you actually play the game and see the graphics and the hook has dislodged itself from your interest.I'm not going to say that the graphics are bad, especially not at a first glance, but SA uses a very dull color palette consisting of almost limelight tints where the shirts of thugs will appear too green for their own good and the palette loves to over-use the color gray... a lot. You'll encounter a lot of gray backgrounds in this game save for maybe the park levels which actually resemble forests.The game play on the other hand is criminal. I don't want to sound like the average game whiner that whines about older games and how hard they were, but I know when a game is being unfair and when I just suck at a game and SA takes the former in astronomic measurements. I never thought Venom or Spidey could take so much damage from wimpy looking thugs, athletic gymnast women who use their hair as whips and headband wearing drunks armed with flintlocks (yes, I'm serious).The enemies in this game are a pain. Some of them are really cheap particularly the wimpy, saggy-shorts jerks in the first level that leap at you from across the screen and the aforementioned gymnasts, but they only get more cheap from there, especially when they throw in guys with Cable-like guns and Iron Man wannabes.I think my favorite boss in the whole game was the first level boss; he's one of the cheapest bosses you'll encounter, but the animation for him (or it, it's a robot, really) is SO funny that it's actually cute. It's like watching a cat walk over the dried surface of a previously rain-proof coated deck as they shake their paws of the sticky feeling before taking another step, it's that funny.You can climb on walls in some levels, but your movement is restricted to the level. Of course, speak of the devil and he shall appear... let's talk about the real nightmare in this unconscious dream state of a game (that analogy sucks):The levels are long, samey brawler levels consisting of streets, a forest-like park, a bridge and a factory and you're going to run through each one for what feels like five minutes straight encountering the exact same enemies and occasionally having the choice of taking different paths which wastes time more than the average game should.None of this is helped by the looped music of each level with only three level songs total; imagine playing through eight levels with only three different songs over and over again, all of which are dwarfed by the opening song that first played.You do get additional help in the game such as Marvel cameos who come out of nowhere once you pick up their icon, but sometimes they don't really help you; some of them have very specific reasons to help you like clearing the screen of enemies or blocking projectiles and in most cases they'll just run on screen, do something for a few seconds, disappear and leave you to continually get your posterior slammed into chewed gum.And if you're hoping the ending and final boss is worth encountering, they really aren't. I'd say buy it for the opening music or a goofy gold robot, but are any of those really valid reasons? I think I'd rather re-coat the deck, wait for it to dry, find any spots that still have those dried, but sticky patches on them and have the cat walk over it again... and to add, I'll join in the fun by walking with her barefoot.If you want game with your nihilism however, then come get some.\n",
      "This game has seen its life. It lacks the motivation and breath-taking function of others of its genre here on 2009. I find Clocktower for the SNES to be more entertaining.-The graphics-Fuzzy character sprites, blood that is so cheap that it looks like red paint? Resident Evil took a whipping in the visual department. The zombies look like Re-Deads. And a brownish/black fuzzy blob is not scary, it's funny. There's been games like Tomb Raider and Croc that visually look better yet they are both PS1 games.Like a Sweet Home spinoff, Resident Evil starts out with very little weapons, but with scarce ammo. The one major difference between these two however, are the controls.That's right, i'm talking about button-busting control schemes. All the earlier RE games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die, a lot. When other games came out (and before) the controls were smoother, RE insisted that the characters turn painfully slow away from an approaching zombie, just giving the zombie enough ample-time to latch on to have lunch, breakfast, and dinner.Now what's so scary about this game?Is it given that M-ratings were considered 'rare' back on the PS1? The script? Or 'knowing' some zombie is gonna come out of that hallway sooner or later? The game starts with the player arriving on the grounds of the mansion (in a grainy video) then inside. Immediately there is conversation. The voice-acting is dull, un-lively and boring. Do I care that there's blood on the floor? No, why? because it looks like paint, that's why! Don't mind the plain-in-sight dead-body laying in the corner there, it's decor! Or not. Again, the voice-acting is as bland and convincing as a monologue broken-record. Ahh. Something's there. Ahhhhh. Bad acting produces bad results.Given that it was the first RE game may be the reason for its praising, considering both it's puzzle-like feature of finding items/unlocking rooms and of course, the zombies in a squashed polygon-rendered environment. But by today's standards (Fallout 3 anyone?) this game simply doesn't cut it. Silent Hill has a remake of it's first game, it may be worth a try. But as for RE 1 original, it's a rent. Try the other games before considering this.\n",
      "are we asking for to much like better music and a story line ive played games that had none all i cared about was fighting a game like this should be more responcive when you move but why dose everyone buy the japanese version the us version has a girila in the cover if you dont have the patients to learn to teleport figure out what moves combo then dont buy it remember this game dosnt have a strategy guide iether it came with a booklet or it didnt and the  booklet dosnt list all the moves\n",
      "If this was a launch title for the Playstaion 1 than one could guarentee that the system would be in the garbage bin along with Atari Jaguar and Virtual Boy.  This game is so horrible and unplayable that it is an embarassment to fighting games.  I will go out on a limb and say that this is the single worst fighting game I have ever played.The idea behind this game is that there are a cast of Dragon BAll GT characters all fighting it out.  There is no plot to speak of in this game and for most (outside of super obsessed fans who know extreme details of every character)they would out this game shortly after the first fight or two.This comes down to my biggest complaint about this game, the controls.  With any video game you need to have responsive controls.  You don't get that here.  There is no combo system to speak of which even early fighting games held (although did not go acknowledge).  Here is the idea of a typical fight on easy.  1:Fight Begins 2: You move forward to attack in which you move painfully slow 3: You hit kick, ten seconds pass and your character does the move 4: Your opponent is hit and fights back 5: Using the dash button you slowly move out of the way 6: You go to use a special (which seems to be insta kill), only to have it countered and you lose 7: Controller then shatters on TV screen in utter frustration.  This is an example of a fight that lasts possible a minute. Like I said the controls are the worst I have ever seen.I feel sorry for those who shell out X amount of dollars on this garbage and I challenge any one out there to give some reason at why this game is supposivly good.  Grand THeft Auto 2 has passed it's mantle as worst game of all time to this game, this is no buried treasure, this is no lost artifact or holy grail, this game is plain and simple garbage.\n",
      "I have been playing video games my entire life and this game is the worst game I have ever played. You can't walk two steps without fighting an enemy and it takes hours to go through one very small castle because of this. The gameplay is horrid,and boring, the music is painfully redunant. Everything about this game sucks! I threw it in the trash!\n",
      "The gameplay is horrid, the graphics sucks for SNES and it's just very very boring to play.\n",
      "This was ONE OF THE WORST GAMES i've ever seen in my life next to Operation Europe and Populous. If your curious, thinking this looks like mario, well its not. Far from such Greatness as Donkey Kong or mario. i played this game for 20 mins the day i got it and aint touched it since. The Nes versions of Adventure island are alot better and more fun than this game. Buy them, But Please, unless you truly wish to own it for being an SNES version of the NES Classic, dont buy it. its nothing like it. It is an oversized half naked fat man that resembles nothing to the Classic Mr. Higgins. Your nowhere near as small as you used to be on the NES and your hathcets just dont throw like they used to. this game was definately made on a low budget and quickly produced for Quick Income. However, i consider it one of the Few SNES Flops. The only reason it truly sold was because people thought it was going to be like the original NES Version, only to find out when they got home teary eyed that ITS NOT. And it definately aint worth good ends neither. When you jump on the game He looks as though he's been busted by the police or going in to convulsions or something... Rather confusing exactly WHAT it looks like hes doing. The Graphics are good, but the controls are not smooth and Gets Repetitive extremely fast, Leadin to Boredom, and eventually getting trashed.\n",
      "the game is pretty cheap and you cant realy do much because the game does all of the fighting for u kind of depressing\n",

      "Very, very, very obsolete, ffiv(ii) aged very poorly, remakes improves over original 10-100-1000 timesMy gripes for this version are:1)graphics are awful, more then a snes game, this looks as a nes game.2)easy version for the us audience, is too damn easy3)no dush button, the game is terrible slow4)very bad and censored script5) Where's the ATB gauge? without gauge, the ATB is pointless6) conversion is terrible! Cut everything! Cut magics, cut skills, censored text, cut out difficulty, this is tolerable?My gripes for this game itself1) music is annoying, 20 seconds MIDI endlessly repeated2)short game, less then 20 hours3)The plot has absolutely zero depth or detail4)primitive gameplay, no job system, no esper system, no materia system, nothing of nothing5)don' t even choose party members, the story choose your party ( most strategic game ever eh?)6)the game world is too generic, no information at all. The game has 8 countries, but, you do not know anything about them.7) no description of items8) in the equipment shops, you don't see the changes of statistics9)too large party so little time, characters don't receive a true development besides kain or cecil10)Rosa is the worst feminine character ever, zero depht, zero background, I don't know any information about her, besides she's the white mage of the castle and love Cecil11)Cecil start evil? Don't make me laugh!!!! In the very first scene it's already a good guy!12)dungeons are boring!

If you want so badly play final fantasy 4 try the psp version( the best version) is 100% improvement over this, or try the ds version if you like cartonish and blocking graphics.Stay away from the terrible gba version, loaded with bugs, bad control, bad sound and low difficult.Psx version is basically uncensored japanese hard-type snes version with a couple of fmv and the dash button, decent version but really no any real improvement.\n",
      "This has got to be one of the most boring mario games I ever played as a child. First of all theres no action no challenges which the bad guys can't kill you, All your doing is just playing as luigi pointlessly running all around the world searching for pointless clues of history to find mario and that's absolutely no fun at all, Your better off going back to school studying world history than to play this game no less.If you want an epic mario game for your SNES look no further than SUPER MARIO RPG LEGEND OF THE SEVEN STARS instead, But yeah avoid this sorry excuse for entertainment.Overall 0/5 stars from me!\n",
      "This game is about as exciting as going to the library to read UA history books.  Literally that is all you do, find items, find their place in history, fill in your history book and that's it.  Plus hours of walking around looking for turtles which can't hurt you.  The bosses or enemies in this \"game\" cannot hurt you....where the hell is the fun in that?!?!?!?  This is easily the worst game ever, even worse than the NES version.\n",

Virtua racer on the genesis is SO much better then this.and the controls..... HOHOHOHOYou go way too fast, and the controls are SO SLUGGISH.I played at least 45 minutes and trained, but I couldnt do good enough, I keep crashing. IDK Y nintendo thought there console was so cutting edge that they tried to make it do 3D polygons, but it fails. leave that up to the PS1 and Sega Saturn.\n",
      "this game is so boring, don't get confused this is nothing like the other kirby games. It's in the style of tetris. and it gives tetris a bad name. This was a disapointment.If you liked this game check out all of the other kirby games\n",
      "This is not a kirby game. It is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun. It is exactly like a game i have on my computer called \"candy crisis\".... But kirby charecters unstead of candy falling down. What u do is match the objects up and try not to over flow the placement. It gives u two different objects at once and u make sure u match the things falling up to what is on the ground which u can move them over or turn them in different directions to match them. I like the original kirby on the nes so i tried this one and its just a puzzle game. I like all of the other kirby games better because they have a story.\n",
      "WOW!!! It's Wolverine in his very own video game!! Let's all celebrate!! Let's throw a ^*&%ing party!!Seriously though, even if the controls weren't disgusting, the mere fact that it has one of the world's most over-rated comic book super heroes would destroy it... for me, anyway. Some people actually worship this guy. You can probably find some geek with a shrine and a poster that says, \"Wolverine, our savior, is better than God!\". Wolverine used to be my favorite until over-exposure such as this ruined him. Now I'm rooting for Storm, who is infinitely (times 2,000,000) better than Wolverine will ever be. What about the game, though? I'd give you one if I could, but I wasn't able to play the game long enough without getting bored out of my mind.\n",

Anyway when i bought this one it looked great. But it was not. When u start to use it u notice that the cord is way shorter than the original controller, it is not even the same as the other because it does not say snes on it it just says nintindo but that does not really matter, and the worst of all the buttons stick and they r really stiff and hard to use. So now when u play multiplayer u r not even close to as good as u r with the original. Save ur money and buy the original one.\n",

      "Complicated Storyline - there is often a limited sense of direction.Although your objectives/directions are usually handed from an NPC in a town, a castle or a cave, you may still find yourself having to keep a pen and paper handy so you won't forget where to go.Item Confusion - the magical properties of certain items aren'talways clear, such as the: Charm Top, the Amulet and the Magic Seal.Repetitive Nature  - the battles with enemies seem extemely repetitive at times; enemies always re-spawn when you walk off the screen. If you come back into a room, you'll be fighting them again. In case you think there was something you missed at a castle, all your enemies are back to greet you.Untimely Deaths - if there's enough powerful enemies on the screen, there's also the risk that your party will get killed off before you cast a single spell. Even though Chrono Trigger utilizes the beautiful Secret of Mana graphics engine - 'Mana' was not only an easier plot to follow but it also didn't have a turn-based battle dynamic like Chrono Trigger. With Chrono, you can't even evade enemies if they're directly in your path. You'll be rolling through every single enemy in the game unless you run away during the battles.Poor Shopping Dynamic - Nearly all the shops in game sell the same stuff. The shop in Medina has cool stuff but the goods are hideously expensive. By the time you have enough coins, the items in your inventory are likely already better.Enemies in the game never drop anything but gold, experience points and replenishment to your HP/MP. All your gear is coming out of a treasure chest in some dungeon.Poor Characterization - all your playable characters are one-dimensional and have very feeble personalities; by this I mean there's very little feeling, emotion or even romantic involvement between characters save for something shallow between Marle and Crono. Compare this to Final Fantasy 3 which despite also having turn-based battles, FF3 had a better soundtrack, storyline, items and graphics. FF3 is also a year older and was made by the same folks at Square.Only in graphics is Chrono Trigger more relevant to Secret of Evermore; however, the boy and his dog still had more depth and character than any single character within Chrono Trigger.BOTTOM LINE - Chrono Trigger's replay value doesn't come from the multiple endings the game has to offer or the handful of choices you can make to encounter those endings. Replay value is associated with forgetting how bad this game is and in trying to overlook all its many drawbacks. The terrible cover art on the box should've been the first warning.\n",
      "Street Fighter II was a crappy fighting game that was completley unplayable.The gameplay is awful and the cartoon graphics just made it even worse.Mortal Kombat had it ALL OVER Street Fighter II in ALL of these areas.Mortal Kombat really shines in the graphics compared to this heap of crap.Playing as realistic digitized characters was just so much better than playing with animated cartoonie looking dorks like Ryu or Ken.Pass this up and get Mortal Kombat instead.I know Mortal Kombat 1 for SNES did not have the blood and gore,but it was and STILL is better than this.Bottom line is...ALL Street Fighter games suck and Mortal Kombat is better in EVERY WAY...MK ALL THE WAY!\n",
      "How anyone can give this title a solid 5stars is beyond me.  This title is by far the worst RPG game ever created!!!  \"Time Stalkers\" is everything gone wrong with an RPG, which had the potential of being a great title, if just a little more time and effort were put into the project.  Dungeons are randomly picked, (which can be an either good or bad thing dependings on one's preference) can only carry 5 items when entering a dungeon (only level 1 weapons can be carried inside a dungeon since your character is started at level even time they enter a new) , and worst of all if you're defeated in a battle guess what, not only do have to start the entire dungeon from scratch, but you're also started back at level 1 and lose all of strong weapons which you had gathered during your voyage!!  What were the creaters thinking?!!  Not only that, but the list goes on and on!!  Do not buy this title!!  I'll make you want to play NES rpg titles!!!  Which are better may I add, than this title!!\n",
      "From what I read about Metropolis Street Racer I expected a solid racing game with speed but got neither. The game favors no contact driving instead of fun...uh I mean speed. Imagine a racing gamme with no speed...who on earth could think of such a dumb concept its like a Sonic game without speed or a Doom type game without gunsReally a sad disapointment. The graphics are okay but the game play SUCKS!! Avoid this like SARS\n",
      "RPGs are my favorite genre.  Especially action ones, which are few and far between.  I was hoping this would be another &quot;Zelda&quot; or &quot;Alundra&quot; with better graphics.  But it was simply annoying.  I cringed the first time I heard Musashi's HORRID voice, and every other time I heard it.  Big disappointment.  The game was promoted as an RPG, but it doesn't remind me of an RPG.  It's an annoying adventure game with annoying voice acting.  The &quot;hero&quot; looks and sounds like a bratty ten year old. Definitely not for everyone, especially someone expecting a typical RPG.  Don't disappoint yourself like I did.  This is the first time I ever returned a game, in the same night to boot! Rent it first!\n",
      "I was reading through some of the glowing reviews for this and I still can't believe that no one has called this game for what it is, a Turkey! The fighting system is garbage. The graphics where ugly. The play controls are so awful it makes me wispful for Pit Fighter. There are cameos from Final Fantasy 7 that you can unlock, if thats your thing. If you are like most people who enjoy a good fighting game for what it is, I promise you will not be too moved by this novelty. You may care even less if you hated Final Fantasy 7, like myself. I would compare this fighting game license title to LucasArts Star Wars: Masters of Ter&auml;s K&auml;si. If you are a fan boy who gobbles up everything Square pooped out in the last 20 years and called it candy, then this is for you. You probably didn't read my review and already purchased this game along with a Tifa body Pillow. I would like to close with the inescapable truth that Capcom can make good RPG's but Square cannot make good fighting games, deal with it!\n",
      "This is basically a chicks game, with toned down action, and horror themes designed to appeal to girls fears, most guys won't like it. More basically it's a failed experiment in game design. They had an interesting problem here with figuring out how to blend two contradictory game models: rpg vs survival horror, or leveling vs running away... But it doesn't work. The only thing interesting to me, in concept not execution, are the battle and weapon upgrade systems. The battle system mixes real time evasion with rpg atb, the problems are: enemies too fast, mostly undodgeable area attacks, slow character and enemies cast a slow spell to make you slower,and there's no room to move in the field. The weapon system has it's own problem with annoying penalties, and inconveniences. There are serious problems with pacing and story development, cutscenes vs playtime, and level design. The writers think that techno babble is story when it's just a plot device. The are parts in the game when you'll watch/read 15 minutes of cutscene, go do something boring that takes 5 minutes(like pressing against a box tapping x trying to get it to open) and then watch/read 20 minutes of cutscenes. The difficulty of the game is annoying, it's mostly designed to move you along like a movie but then will drop in cheap insta kill attacks. A lot of the rooms are empty except for graphic decoration, there is no dramatic action, plot element, or puzzle to solve, and exist only to hold a key to the room next door. Monsters infinitely respawn at doorways, and there's no way to pass but to fight them again. The monster design ranges from silly and lame like random placement of arms and legs, down to embarrassing like the final boss, who has a giant peepee for a tail, and a n-t sack hanging off his -ss. For most of the game you'll hear the same two song: overworld arpeggio, and battle theme. Camera angles suck. I could go on critisizing but it's tedious. This game is obsolete and only of interest for game design students.\n",
      "I own Saga Frontier one and it isn't as bad this is.  Why can't these SaGa Frontier games be good?  I thought that this game would be different.  No longer competely non-linear gameplay.  There is a story that is very evident how who are supposed to follow it.  Not like Saga Frontier where you could wander around for three hours and still not know what you wher doing.  The battle system reminded me of old Game Boy games.  You can only use this weapon 50 times and the attacks are incredibly weak quick whack the enemy again.  I'm sorry but I am a firm believer that weapons shouldn't have a fixed usage to them.  I believe that they should break on a rare occasion but they shouldn't have fixed number of times to use.  The story goes between two characters that you choose which one to follow.  At least they took a better stab at making a better story for the characters than they did last time.  The battle system is also very complex.  There are three types and sometimes it really confuses the player as to the differences between the three (and there are differences).  The game's music has never been a strong point.  I didn't care for it at all.  Some of it was really good the rest sounded really bad.  The graphics are beautiful though.  They look very similar to those in Legend of Mana (same artists I think) and they will bowl you over.  If you like graphics and don't care about anything else with a game enjoy.  Otherwise don't waste your money.\n",

      "the only advantage to purchasing the cd set is that it comes with a manual / playbook.  but you will get the \"anox.exe encountered a problem and needs to close\" error, so you will have to download the digital version from gog.  i am playing the digital version, and find it ok.  you walk around talking to people, and if you like games like that, ... .  i prefer strategy games like starcraft and warcraft.  homeworld is good also.with homeworld, i could put my system to standby, and when it came out of standby, i could pick up where i left off.  it was that stable.  homeworld's gameplay is flawless.  just about the only other game that played this well, of the classics, is starseige tribes, and you need to download an update to play that because all the original servers are no longer up.i loved the stability of homeworld, that it played perfectly out of the box.i can't say the same of arachronox, which constantly gives me \"anox.exe encountered a problem and needs to close\".  i couldn't find a patch.  i downloaded the gog version, which plays well.xeno clash, installed steam then stopped.mirror's edge, wouldn't run without an internet connection.about the game:i have never got to play arachronox without encountering some problem.  the gameplay is horrible.  get starseige or homeworld or starcraft.

      "This game is boring because it's all the same. If you get a different pokemon, it doesnt matter. you do the same thing over and over. You attack and beat and attack and beat. It's too easy too. I thought Pokemon Snap was MUCH better! That game was one of my favorites. This game just has no point. Fighting is the only thing you do. I mean the gameboy pokemon was better than this one! You get to go on an adventure and find things and get items! That was fun. This is fighting ONLY. Boring! If you want a good pokemon game get any of them for gameboy including Yellow, Blue, Red, Gold, Silver. Or even better, get pokemon snap!\n",
      "Is it me or is this game really boring, repetitive commentary, pointless competitions, no advancement for beginners to masters, and even the \"fun\" little party games are quick and boring. There are several parts to the game, the challenge road where you go through six Pokemon categories each getting more difficult. There is the freestyle where you battle against other Pokemasters or your friends. There are even nine party games which get old very fast. You are supposed to use your own Pokemon from your Gameboy pack, but there is a way to cheat by using the rental Pokemon which comes with all 150 Pokemon (instead of having to earn them). Even children get bored quickly of the game. There is a good part to the Pokemon Stadium package, it comes with a piece of hardware that lets you play your Gameboy on the N64. This also is not a RPG like the Pokemon Gameboy games are.\n",
      "If you have a Gameshark, get this game. I thought it would be easy, but now I need a Gameshark. I named my Pikachu Rocky and it only says &quot;Pika&quot; on Stadium. If you're good at Stadium, you could get this game too. Get if you can beat Red and Blue without cheating. That is what Yellow is like without a GameShark. I can't even pass Celadon City because Pikachu is so scared.\n",
      "I was really desprite to get this game because I wanted ahelicopter Gunship game.  I had Commanche Gold but that was good for beginers. I wanted something more advanced.  I bought this.Here is my two cents.  This game was terrible. DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING IT IS GOOD.  If you really want a good Attack helicopter game get &quot;Eenemy Engaged: RAH-66 Commanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum B: Aligator&quot; Long name but good game.  Now back to Gunship.  As everyone said the waypoont system just plain doesn't work, you have to go through a whole menu system and it only worked for me during the demo.  The CP/G is a usless jerk who never does anything you say.  And if you play as the CP/G the pilot always gets you killed.  Firing a missile at the target YOU want is nearly impossible and for [the price] this is just a real rip off.So in a summary all I can say is don't buy this buy somethiung else...\n",
      "After playing DOA Ultimate for Xbox, people may be tempted to buy this version for Dreamcast. Don't bother, this version for Dreamcast is extremely boring. It has zero replay value. This game is garbage compared to the better Xbox versions.Other Dreamcast games that are 100 times better: Virtua Fighter 3, Soul Calibur, and Project Justice. These 3 games are excellent and are only available on Dreamcast.\n",
      "Just when you thought it was safe to put off Baldurs Gate, here comes Icewind Dale.  A magnificent combination of BG and the older games in the gold box series.  Dungeon hacking and roleplaying at their best.In  Icewind Dale, you form an entire party of your Player Characters, compared  other BG engine games in which you were allowed one main player.  This  makes it more fun, allowing you to watch your adventurers progress one at a  time as they grow so much more powerful than they were when the game  began.Another added bonus is the addition of new spells and monsters.  The enemy AI is stronger, and the new monsters such as mind flayers will  provide enough fun and frustration to make this game a challenge for any  level player.Look out Diablo 2, Icewind Dale is a major contender to  knock you off the number one spot!  One error for Diable 2 and its gone,  because Icewind Dale is perfect.\n",

      "This will also be my review for every subsequent SmackDown! game. After WCW started to lose popularity, THQ started to do WWF-themed wrestling games. When it did, even beginning on the N64, there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap. They finally succeded (so to speak, if that was their actual intent) when they started the SmackDown! series. I have no problems with the graphics, the entrances, or the sound in this game. I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls.First off, they gave the game arcade style feel and controls. Big mistake. They also made it more like the actual show: you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves. I may be in the minority, but constantly punching a guy gets old fast. I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat. Secondly, the game's A.I. has gotten extremely intelligent. Too intelligent. The game can kick your ass unless you're a great gamer, and I'm just average, maybe a little below. Mainly because of the counter system. The game goes like this: punch, punch, punch, punch, grapple, move-counter move-counter move, etc. You'll get countered excessively, and your counters won't work most of the time. Yes, it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV, but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion, it can't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go. I don't want to spend over an hour or more in a match, 15-30 minutes is plenty, unless it's a Royal Rumble-type match.THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe. I honestly don't understand what the fans see in this series of game. I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work, and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering, than this is the game for you. If you want an actual FUN wrestling game, then I suggest you stick with THQ's WCW games on the N64. At least then, they had the right idea.\n",
      "Well, where do I start?  We all know about the basics.......the lack of tech support, the missing roleplaying element, and the incredible lag. But it isn't these things that make this game so horrid to play.  One can wing  it without tech support........and I have on MANY occasions, out of  necessity........I can also wait out lag or just reconnect.  I missed the  &quot;Quest&quot; part of Everquest.....but still managed to get some  enjoyment out of the graphics.  Now.....here's the REAL reason why you  shouldn't get EverQuest.  After around level 15 or so (if you are a  talented soloist), you are FORCED to group to gain levels. That's right  folks.  You have NO choice in the matter.  Guess what this means?  This  means you have to group with 5 other vicious, backstabbing whining,  complaining 13 year olds that have absolutely no respect and little if any  regard for you.  I'd much rather put my trust in a rabid pit bull than  trust the life of my character to a cleric who plays like a  wizard.Enough said.  You will probably buy this game.....and probably  think back on this review and say &quot;Well, he was right after all&quot;.  And I have only one thing to say to that.........I TOLD YOU SO.\n",
      "I tried playing this game, but right from the start, I knew I was in trouble. No matter what I changed in the video options or on my monitor, this game was just too dark. The first guy I talked to I couldn't even see and the item he left me I couldn't find because it was just too dark. This is the only game I have had this problem with. It could be an awesome game, but I will never know.\n",
      "This game could have been so much more.  The hack and slash action is not even fun, it just get's tedious and boring.  I have to admit the graphic's are spectacular, but that does not make this a great game.  Rune contains lot's of jumping from object to object, which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game.  The game also had no depth whatsoever.  I never just want to play it for fun, because I felt there almost is no fun in this game.  In my opinion, if you are going to get a hack and slash action game GET BLADE OF DARKNESS.\n",

      "this game kinda stinks.you go talk to this old dude who gives you these long drawn out battle plans.then you watch these long drawn out cut scenes.then you go into these map/worlds.when you get near an enemy,you fight.well,sort of.the computer does everything.theres a lot of complicated planning involved.theres no clear cut way to figure out anything.its a real pain in the hiney.whats more is i dont belive i even saw any ogres.of course im only on like level 2 since the game is totaly screwed.i bought it used and the guy before me only got that far too.no wonder i got this so cheap.this game will use up all of your extra brain space.if you thought out how to beat it.you wouldnt have the brain sense left to eat cheerios.someone would have to run you an iv.youd almost have to be like freakin fixated on its ended.its totaly freakin ridiculous.and then ,as youre being slain by little people with sticks,even though youre sporting a dragon,you are helpless to defend yourself.it sucks.\n",

      "I'm a big time 2D fighting veteran and I can tell which fighter is worth playing all over and which is worth ditching. Marvel VS Capcom for the PlayStation is an example of one of those 2D fighters that needs to be ditched. But don't get me wrong ! I actually liked the game...on the Dreamcast and arcade. The PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just swarming with a whole lot of flaws. Trust me ! This is not arcade perfect ! Most of the times, arcade translations that go to the PlayStation come out imperfect like this one. The graphics are just horrible ! Sure the characters and stages look colorful, but if you pay attention to the framerates of the animations, you'll notice that the characters don't move smoothly or move faster. The audio, sounds great. Music tracks and sound effects are brilliant, but nothing special at all. And as for the gameplay, just horrible. And the lack of a tag feature ? Now this is really going overboard ! Just like in Marvel Super Heroes VS Street Fighter for the PlayStation, you have to call up your character to do a one-hit special move. If you want the tag feature, you'll have use the cross over mode, but this feature doesn't emulate the tag features on the superior arcade and Dreamcast versions. The controls could've been slicker, but instead, it ended up choppy. It seems that the PlayStation controller was not meant for great games like this. All in all, the PSX version of Marvel VS Capcom is a big letdown. Choppy animation, choppy controls, lack of a tag feature, and long loading times during the beginning of each fight really makes this game look like a zero. If you want the real Marvel VS Capcom experience, I'd say buy the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom or spare a few quarters or tokens to play the arcade version. The DC version of Marvel VS Capcom featured flawless animations, awesome graphics, hyper fast controls, no loading times, and a tag feature. Now that's an arcade perfect translation of one of the best 2D arcade fighters of all time ! The DC version is definently worth the money and worth your time ! Please ! Whatever you do, avoid the PSX version ! This version of Marvel VS Capcom is a disgrace to Capcom's ever expanding lineup of 2D fighters ! Not really something to use your money on !\n",
      "Yes, to a highschool kid working at Mcdonald's for five fifteen (have to spell it out for amazon) an hour 40 bucks was a lot! Even though there was the internet it was still growing. You still couldn't find a review for every game you were interested in buying. Sometimes it still came down to word of mouth or hoping there was an open copy you could play at funcoland. I however went by word of mouth. Sure, this is a great game try it you'll like it. Like a sucker I put down my big 40 which was probably 3/4ths of my total paycheck. I smiled in joy as a road the bus home with my new found game. Yiiipppieeeeee! I couldn't wait! I come home and pop this wonderful gem in. Of course this game is badass! how can I go wrong look at that hardcore cover. A soldier that's ready for war what more could you want? Then the game starts and I begin to play it. The screen is dark too dark I can't see anything. I adjust the brightness on my television. I'm a little green guy who shoots pellets or maybe bullets out his gun in a horrible looking world with horrible aiming and horrible controls that make the entire screen move awkwardly with each step. I think to myself this will get better this is probably just like this on the first stage. Then as I play I realize that it doesn't change... it never changes. It's just green globe of pixels that shoots a horribly aimed weapon in a dimly lit world. How could this be? How could what could have been a fun game be so crappy? Even in PS1 days this game was unacceptable. That comes from a guy that plays PS1 games still in 2011! This game slowly crushed my gaming dreams and made me hate the name 3DO! I cursed it and spat at it. I immediately went back to the story and tried to make an excuse to return the game. I told them it was defective and that the game was too dark to see (actually that was more of the truth than anything else). I begged and pleaded with the manager but unfortunately she showed me a new copy of the game, opened it before my eyes (smashing my hopes of returning it as new), and handed it to me. I looked down in my hands at a new copy of the same turd I just tried to flush. I took the game and walked out the store with my head hung low. A month later that toys store burned down. I smiled as I passed by. A feel of ease that no one would have to suffer anymore and knowing that numerous copies of Army Men world war had perished in that fire. Yes, I had one that war. I lost the battle when I returned it but I won in the end.P.S. I didn't start the fire.\n",
      "I bought X-Men:Mutant Academy as an X-Men fan. I wanted to like it, but it was just awful.  The graphics suck, the sounds are cheap, and the whole game itself is all around cheesey.  No way that this game is worth the money; go buy some X-Men comics instead.\n",
      "This is the most boring game for game boy. All of the moves are kick, punch, rage. That is it. If you want a good game, i would agree. I would get street fighter alpha 2\n",
      "Here is yet another poor X-Men game for the GBC courtesy of Activision, only this one is the worst.  While the PS1 version of X-Men: Mutant Academy wasn't half bad, this GBC conversion is downright terrible thanks to the clunky controls, insanely easy difficulty, bland backgrounds, and scratchy sound.  While the player animations are colorful, they are quite jerky, and while the selection of fighters is nice, there is just something more to be desired.  All in all, even if your the biggest X-Men fan, leave this game on the shelf, it's terrible.\n",
      "I'm a pretty good gamer, but sometimes there's a few little hidden &quot;extras&quot; in a game worth checking out.  GameShark lets you do it.  If you're patient.  And have a lot of time.  And don't mind HOPING that your codes work after you swith the GS disc with the game.  And don't care that it doesn't fit in port 1, so many games it works for can't even use it. ....\n",
      "..Until I read Rob Matthews' review of this game. I am also stuck on the training mission. I never got past it since I would go up the elevator, shoot a guard and then wind up at the beginning. This is a bug to end all bugs. It felt like I was in that Star Trek episode where they kept repeating the same day over and over again.I had high hopes for this game...\n",
      "Yes, this game is amazingly difficult, as the &quot;Cons&quot; say up above. The enemies do the same thing every time you play the level, so basically you just play the same level over and over to find out the scripting of that level so you can make an attempt to beat it. And quick, your hit might leave, so it's timed. Also, it took me an hour to beat the tutorial, which is required. And, even worse, you can't save during levels which makes it frustrating. Barely over 10 small maps. Maybe a few more. Bad Game.\n",
      "I had looked forward to this game for months.  It installed without incident.  The problem I had was the tutorial, beginning with the elevator (lesson #4).  The booklet says to &quot;call elevator&quot;.  I didn't have to because the elevator was already there with its door open.  Then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select &quot;basement level 3&quot;.  Clicking on the control panel did not work.  What did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved.  Then I go to the very last Lesson (9) with the sniper rifle.  I could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial, and as a result could not play the game.  This game is loaded with bugs.  Don't take my word for it--go to eidosinteractive.com and look at the forums for Hitman.  I wasn't the only one to have trouble in the elevator.\n",
      "After suffering through the first &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; game, I felt hopeless. I was dazed and confused. I didn't have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity. And then I saw the second game in the series on the shelves. I said, &quot;I'd heard the questions aren't repeated as much&quot;, and I decided to buy it just to see if it was true.It's true, the questions aren't repeated as much as before. The problem is, now they're MUCH harder! It's impossible to get anything higher than $16,000 now! And since the questions don't repeat, you'll never get to the top!But what's the worst part? That's the ONLY CHANGE that was made to this game. NOTHING ELSE!!!!! It's as if the first game had no problems whatsoever! Regis is STILL appallingly rude and impatient, the &quot;Fastest Finger&quot; mode STILL doesn't let you put the four answers in order, the game STILL quits if you take too long to do things, you STILL can't skip the introduction sequence, the Phone-a-friend lifeline is STILL worthless, there's STILL no option to make the games easier or harder, you STILL only get instructions once, and there's STILL no option to use the mouse! Regis even says EXACTLY the same stuff as before!I bought the game out of total curiosity, just to see if this game was really any better than the first. As it turns out, it is virtually the EXACT SAME GAME. It has all the problems of the first, except for one which was replaced by another one!This game has not been improved one bit over the first.  The makers didn't even try to improve it.  This game displays total laziness and lack of creativity.  It's not worth one second of your time.\n",
      "Okay people it's time for me to really point out reasons to NOT buy a PS2  now that I actually got several hours of gaming with this system (And five  different games) to come up with my answer!  To start out I visited my  friends house one day and saw his new Playstation 2 he had gotten.  When I  asked if we could play it, he didn't really want to (This from a guy who  has three and a half shelf's with nothing but Playstation games!!!  That's  practically every game Sony made!!!), but finally agreed.  I can now see  why.  Not only were the games NOTHING Sony promised us (They said the games  were going to be a revolution.  I fail to see how.).  For one thing the  graphics are nothing that the Dreamcast hasn't offered us.  For onther  things were still getting the sames games over, and over!  Just with better  graphics!  No internet play (SEGA already has an advantage with that in  mind!), and didn't Sony promise us it would be compatable with Playstation  games?  I thought so too.  But only 3 of the 27 games we tried to do this  with worked!  And it didn't enhance the graphics!!!  The DVD player is  nothing but trash also.  It won't play many movies, and those it does play  don't have very good quality!  Plus DVD players are on cell phones  practically, why would we want them on a game counsel (Especally if you've  already got a DVD player)!?!  Plus almost all games (Playstation or  Playstation 2 games) freeze up countless times!  In Tekken because I was  fighting too fast the system froze up on me, but yet in Sonic Adventure (On  Dreamcast) I'm running on walls, jumping off buldings, and zooming around  the place at 70 miles per hour and the game doesn't glich once!!!  Now  thats sad (For Sony anyway).  And when it comes down to the worst games  I've played yet, don't expect this system to last long.  With that in mind  please be careful when buying this system, it might be worse thanyou  thought it would be.\n",
      "Unlike the other reviews, i was very disappointed with the game. I was very excited the the game game out.  Love the cartoon series.  I made the mistake of purchasing it before testing it on a rental.  I thought it moved too slowly and the battles with other digimon was unstimulating.  The only good thing i can say about the game are the graphics are excellent and the sound FX are okay.  Rent this game if you can before you purchase it - just in case you do'nt like it.\n",
      "This was greatly disapointing, at the time it was released i was highly anticipating this game. Took some years later to get around to getting a copy, and it definitely wasn't worth the wait.This is not worth even calling a game in my opinion. The fact you have to take your Digimon partner to the bathroom every 5minutes made me giveup my first game after a while of torturing myself and hoping it got better but kept getting more disapointed. If you don't take your partner to the bathroom it poops on the ground, and if you walk too close after he eats it. And the only way to clean it is for him to eat it(and it gets harder to avoid the more ''accidents'' your partner makes. Instead of a flash or something it makes you wait for your Digimon to use the potty. The character who is human don't ever eat or use the toilet(as far as i have seen), which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world, and your partner Digimon is supposed to be a digital monster(so you would think the reverse would be more likely).So you are left with 2 options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an ''accident''  or let him have accidents and once he eats so many he'll digivolve into Numemon Who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and don't have personal cleanliness(but if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when he's hungry he will still end up Numemon). And if your traveling to follow the story, it's hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next ''accident'' occurs.i will not buy or rent any of the next games, because this was such a failure. i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet, then watch him everytime he goes..?AGVN should review this, i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played. The sims i'll admit the characters have to use the toilet occasionally, but it's a longer time in-between bathroom breaks and you can switch between characters when one is in the bathroom you don't have to watch and wait when you just want to play the darn game.\n",
      "okay i heard all the bad things about the game. but i thought nah it cant really be that bad, people are just expecting too much. well i was wrong, the game is that bad. and i tried so very very hard to like it. i love sports games and was addicted to nfl2k religiously, so when i heard sega was doing a baseball game i was waiting desperatly for it.unfortunatly it doesn't come close to even triple play 99. the graphics are at times very very good, but  they have a tendency to repeat the same things all the time. the pitcher does the same thing on the mound every time.the biggest problem is gameplay, it doesnt really have any. when you look at other baseball games out there on other systems this is sad. dreamcast has something to prove to both the people who have bought it and to psx addicts. that we havn't made a mistake in buying and supporting the system. but with a title as bad as this it doesn't help the cause.the commentary is the flatest, dullest most braindead there is. the difference in quality between nfl2k and ws2k1 is huge. nfl2k is a very cool game and nfl2k1 looks even better. if this game had been to its standard we would have had something to really write about.now my hope goes to espn baseball early next year.\n",
      "Sega has never let us down with every release of its top-notch baseball game, World Series Baseball. It has always been the game to beat. Until now. It boggles the mind how Sega refused to even remotely worry about the people actually playing this piece of garbage. Sure, the graphics are the most superb I've ever witnessed. But the inability to control your fielders is NOT a good thing. Add that to the fact that your fielders also seem to be playing for your opponents,(I'm sorry, but you just do not wait until a line drive is right next to you before deciding to move after it.) and you've got the worst game ever. Not the worst sports game, the worst GAME EVER. PERIOD. I WOULDN'T MAKE MY WORST ENEMY PLAY THIS.Graphics: 9 - it just don't get better Control: 4 - yeah, so you can throw and swing... so what? Sound: 5 - it's a baseball game... what'd you expect, Metallica? &quot;Fun-ocity&quot;: 2 -me no like much.OVERALL: 1 star - This game is a lot like those certain girls in High School; looks good, but you still wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.\n",
      "Everyone who owned a Dreamacst couldn't wait! They were sitting on the edge of their seat just waiting and waiting for the arrival of the first baseball game for the Dreamcast! World Series Baseball 2K1.Everyone who bought it, including me was shocked. Did Sega forget that a great baseball video game is more than just graphics? When I got this game along with NBA 2K1 and NFL 2K1 I was amazed by the graphics. Preston Wilson looked, batted and threw exactly like he actually does and the stadiums were just breathtaking.I couldn't wait to get into the game so I did an exhibition game. I was stunned! There was no maual-fielding option, hitting was nearly impossible and getting through an inning without getting shelled was just as hard. I played this game for about 10 minutes trying to figure out if it was just me that I was so bad and that there was no manual-fielding, but I realized that's the way the game is. After playing once or maybe twice I put this game away for good then traded it in along with a few other games for Sonic Adventure 2 and Soul Calibur. That's probably the best move I ever had made.I now own World Series Baseball 2K2 because I knew it couldn't get any worse. The player graphics are worse, but the stadium's are more detailed. The rosters are more up-to-date, the gameplay is excellent, pitching is fun, hitting has been improved a lot and of course you can actually field unlike this game!WSB 2K1 is a terrible game. If you want a baseball game for your Dreamcast get WSB 2K2. It's awesome!\n",
      "I wish that I used to review games as a job because the only way I can play World Series Baseball 2K1 is if I were paid to do it!!\n",
      "This game has great graphics, of course; but the game play is equally reciprocated.  In this game you are only allowed to throw and hit.  All the  excitement of robbing your opponent of a home run with a stellar catch or a  taking away a base hit with a diving catch is taken away.  You cannot play  defense at all!  Your job is to throw in the right direction, but that is  even tasking because the response time is so slow that you have to press  the throw button repeatedly.  Even if you get the throw off in time, your  player receiving the throw will take a couple seconds before he finally  attempts to make a tag; and by then it's obviously too late.  Speaking of  delayed reactions, the commentary is too monotonous and belongs with the  ranks of Genesis games.  I would take the classic, &quot;Bases  Loaded&quot;, over this junk any day.\n",
      "Please don't get this game it sure aint worth any ten bucks heck I wouldnt pay 50 cents for it worst game I own\n",
      "Shen Mue has received rave reviews from almost every on-line site and magazine that I have come across. But interestingly enough, almost every reader board I have seen on-line has expressed a very different opinion: This game was terribly disappointing. I'm an RPG fan, so I'm used to running around towns and talking to people, but when you're FORCED to do this for HOURS on end without any action, it gets tedious...and more tedious...and frustrating...and finally, you want to throw your Dreamcast out the window! I honestly think that the only reason this game received such great reviews was simply because it was one of the first RPGs on Dreamcast. Now that Grandia II, Phantasy Star, and Skies of Arcadia have been released, RPG-lovers have a MUCH better selection to choose from. Pick up one of those great games instead, and don't even bother with Shen Mue. From start to finish, it's just one big disappointment after another...\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that I am a huge nintendo fan and the DK games are some of my all time favs. DK country on the super nes is a true platform classic.  Now when I heard that game was being ported to the GBC I was excited.  I remembered how great the DK Land games were on the gameboy, so I knew that this game would be just as good.The moment I got this for my birthday, I hurridly popped it into my gameboy.  The game at first seemed alright, the sprites and graphics during gameplay Looked Like crap and moved super stiffly.  Even the older DK Land games had better physics.  But I chugged along with the game, upon getting further in the game I just couldn't take it anymore, the crappy gameplay got to me enough, I could not play it anymore, it kept pissing me off, this was nowhere near as fun as the supernes version.In the end I ended up throwing the cartridge against the wall.  Be smart and stay away from this piece of junk, go buy the GBA version or supernes version or buy it off the VC.  I Love DK but this game is pure garbage.\n",
      "I owned this game when i got a game boy advance and I can tell you: IT SUCKED!!!Graphics 0/10- Terrible Graphics. Even an arcade game would have better graphics. other GBC Games would have better graphics. I am disgusted.Music 0/10- They screwed up the music and put other stuff in the game.Game Play -5/1000- harder and less fun.Overall -5,000,000/10- Stay away from it.\n",
      "It's too late to have a refund, but the Rumble Pak doesn't work. PLUS, the seller didn't take out the batteries. Really? Want battery acid all over it?\n",
      "This is only a rumble if you are under 8 years old, otherwise it&#8217;s ...tremble that is not worth the money or the AA batteries that you need for it. The Rumble Pack fits into the slot of your N64 controller, and then a save pack fits into the Rumble Pack, making the controller quite heavy! There are two settings for the pack, low and high. Another annoying part of the pack is that there are two modes, one to turn the Rumble Pack on, and the other to work your gamepack to save games. Its just a hassle, and the only games that really use it are Zelda when you are fishing and sporting games, so you can feel the action.\n",
      "I remember seeing previews for this game a couple of years ago; beautiful, sweeping lanscapes and dragons floating through the sky. I decided to buy the game about a year ago (I was poor, and waiting for the price drop). I had hoped that this could fill the void as I awaited the release of Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2.Well, FFX has come and went, as have countless other games, and I STILL cannot muster the energy to put the sad, sad \"Legend of Dragoon\" out of its misery. I don't even know where to BEGIN damning this game, so let's begin at the beginning...Firstly, who in the WORLD conceived the lousy, pitiful soundtrack? From the opening title screen on, it seems as if the music was composed by some hair-metal band after a suicide attempt. And the plot? Can't Squaresoft sue? I mean, I have never seen a bigger ripoff of Final Fantasy VII, from the spiky haired lead character to the silver haired foe leading him by the nose across the world! Unfortunately for all, the results are far inferior to the Square offering...Also, who in the world TRANSLATED this thing? (I assume it is translated, I HOPE it is translated, I PRAY it is translated, sigh). Every character needs about a paragraph to say what could be thoroughly explained in a sentence. Does anyone even CARE about these characters? I sure don't...Oh, let's not forget the battle engine. Before every (RANDOM) encounter, the screen melts away like sand, followed by a sweeping camera laying out the poorly drawn field of battle, followed by a shot of the characters, and then one of the monsters. This happens before EVERY battle! I estimate a good ten hours of playtime is wasted just from this...Oh, and the battles? Don't even get me started. I will describe but one of the (uncountably infinite) shortcomings: a character can only cast magic while in the \"dragoon\" state. This makes every battle unbearably long, and expect to be hit with a random encounter every 5 seconds or so...I guess I'm left to ask, \"What was the big deal?\" Personally, I feel sorry for the schmoes who plunked down full price for this stinker (and apparently there were a lot of you; this game is a best-seller!). I suppose this is the reason for the ridiculously high rating this knockoff has received. Well, if there is anyone else thinking of buying this, DON'T! I hope the rant has dissuaded you! ZERO STARS!!!\n",
      "\"I will stop you to go forward\" the portal watcher of Ulara said to me, the main protagonist.  Of course what she meant was \"I won't let you pass.\"Above is just one hilarious example of the terrible dialogue in this game.  The dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game, demeaning the characters, story, and entire game to amateur level.Dungeons are the heart of this game's gameplay, which are long and tedious.  Same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area.  The numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and dry.Supposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks.  This is true, almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance.  However I did not find this to be enjoyable.  After hundreds of battles I was pleading for the game to automate my attacks.  Repetition of button-timing and button-mashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fast.Soundtrack was quite nice though, paralleling Final Fantasy series quality.  This however doesn't make up for the rest of this mess.With poor story and gameplay, this game is not something I enjoyed playing.\n",
      "There is no way this game could be fun at all. All you can do is select a ship ,you can't even build your own you have to choose A preselected class, choose your crew ,you can read there bio but it most often won't help you choose, then you install parts ,you cant even place the parts in your ship they just appear there and the part discription isn't helpfull at all, then select A misson and just watch an icon travel over A 1D map of space in real time with an occasional mini movie. Very boring Don't waste your money.\n",
      "What in the name of creation led to the production of this revolting pile of poop. If Starship Creator and its Deluxe edition weren't enough of an embarrassment, then the authors certainly achieved what has to be the greatest defacation of software garbage in the ST gaming genre. I personally couldn't believe that I actually bought this worthless piece of junk, but in saving face, I can admit that I did so based on name alone- lowering my opinion for the licensing standards of the ST name that Paramount retains. Whoever created second edition of this game should be shot. It maintains the same rediculous promises that it never delivers in previous versions and worse yet, it leaves out ships that were part of previous releases. On the upside, it allows you to export the ships you create the into Dominion Wars DS9 game which might be useful. Otherwise, you are wasting time as far as a stand alone product, especially if you are expecting to have a good time. Evidently, what passes for fun with Simon &amp; Schuster is the kind of game that plays like a DOS reject, without the frills, bells or whistles. To make matters worse, its graphic content reflects this philosophy making it the worst ST game I have ever played. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. You will not experience any actual gameplay outside of selecting parts or crew members from a list. This game bites.\n",
      "I can't believe Square Soft put out a game with game play and a storyline as lame as Vagrant Story.  The battle commands are unwieldy and  time-consuming, and the dialog balloons are rather childish and  distracting.  Granted, some of the effects and characters are neat, but I  have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence.  After  that, it's a disappointment for experienced gamers.  I played the game for  about three hours until I couldn't stand it anymore, thinking I would get  used to it, but I just didn't like it.\n",
      "Really? I don't understand why some one would buy this. The PS2 isn't going to get any more stable with the help of it (and is pretty stable without it) and all it does is put a blue plastic bar in front of the ps2. It's a waste of money unless you want a blue plastic bar in front of your ps2 (I don't see the point but if you think it'll make your ps2 look better I guess that could be worth buying). But if you are buying it cause you think it will be functional for anything... um... sorry, there's nothign it really does (The vertical stand at least offers a little more stability).\n",
      "I believe it was P.T. Barnum who said \"There's a sucker born every minute.\"  If Barnum knew anything about Sony's vertical and horizontal stands for the PS2, he would have added, \"And that sucker shells out 10-15 bucks for useless plastic.I'm sure Sony had some reasoning (other than money) to create and market this thing.  The carpeting thing as many people mentioned is one, but I don't see why anyone would do that in the first place.  I think it even says in the PS2 instructions not to place it on carpet.  And I know that it's not for stability (though the title of my review may be poking fun at it), but this thing is all around useless.Look at the features: Air circulation?  Raises the gaming unit?  STABILIZES?!?!  Sleek design and looks cool.  Whatever.  Wanna know how to get around this?  Circulation - don't put your PS2 on carpet, under water, buried in dirt, or anywhere near your little brother's Pokemon toys.  Raises the gaming unit - try putting it up on blocks as one reviewer suggested, or if you like get a car jack and just raise the thing and lower it to your preference.  Stabilizes - I could go into a fifteen paragraph tangent about that one but I wont.  You all know what I would say.  Sleek design and looks cool - if you're worried about your PS2's looks, you probably have more issues than a horizontal stand can fix.  And if you're that concerned, the PS2 will always look \"cooler\" than that purple toaster oven-shaped mini-disk playing Game Cube.  No offense to Nintendo.I reviewed the vertical stand too, and I basically said the same thing.  I don't own either, and I have no plans to buy them.  I think it's just a way for Sony to rip people off.  No other game system needs something like this, and I'm sure the next generation Playstation wont need it either.Uh-oh, gotta go.  I put my PS2 in the horizontal position and it's starting to teeter.  AGH!  It's falling right toward my Metal Gear Solid 2 game!!\n",
      "Everyone keeps reviewing PS2 in general, and it's completely irrelevant. This is a NEW version. So let me review the one I got.This is the new smaller design, a little bigger than a DVD case. While it may look cool, it is NOT recommended. The only pro is how cool it looks.The CONS:Will accept PS1 Memory cards and old PS2 Memory cards BUT will not let you use them until you reformat them. This means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there, DON'T COUNT ON IT.The door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer. You'd think they'd have learned not to go back to this since their last design failed so frequently with this function.The only reason you should get this Playstation is if:A - You have never owned a Playstation beforeB - You have no friends that own Playstations (so you won't have to worry about bringing games over eachothers places, or showing your pal where you are on the game via his Playstation)C - You don't intend on playing your old games on the new system, in any way shape or form. (Except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over again).Maybe I seem a little bitter, but my main grudge is that I just got home from playing a game I started at a friends house, put 4 hours of work into, then brought home. Then I popped the memory card in, played for another 4 hours (all the while, saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully).. when I realized that the game I was \"overwriting\" was actually the same game over and over. It never overwrote anything. So now, when I turn off my playstation, there goes 4 hours of work.And what happens when I put in the NEW PS2 Formatted Memory card to see if I can save on that? oh HELL NO. Ofcourse not, it won't even recognize the memory card while the game is still in.Thanks a lot Playstation. Atleast if my new XBox screws up, I can save it to the hard drive. Jerks.\n",
      "Sony deletes the functionality of the hard drive upgrade and calls this an improved design. I beg to differ!Find the original full sized model unless you plan on putting this in your car or live in a very small box or van \"down by the river!\"\n",
      "I wish I had done my homework before purchasing this system.  It has half the ram of an regular xbox console.  Game performance was slow.  Navigating was slow.  Size is great.  It will fit anywhere.\n",
      "I loved the size of the new PSTwo, but it is still overpriced.  You can buy an Xbox for this price.  Even though the Xbox is larger, it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you don't need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require.  True playstation has a larger number of games, but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months.  Such as Fable, Halo 2, MechAssault 2: Lone wolf ect.Pros.1. Small size and portable2. Large game selection from PS1 and PS2 titlesCons.1. Priced as much as an Xbox (When this hits $100 dollars next year I will be first in line to buy it.)2. Games graphically challenged compared to xbox3. More money for memory cards including special memory cards for PS1 game saves.Sony,take a hint and reduce the price of PSTwo or bundle it with memory cards, two controllers, and a game for this price.\n",
      "i loved the original playstation, like everyone else. it was a great platform and had all the great games. but in my opinion, the playstation 2 has been a total bust. average-at-best games, hardware problems (i had to send in my first ps2 for repairs because it decided it didn't need to read discs anymore. then it decided to start grinding circular ruts in my discs. i finally had to take a $70 loss and trade that POS in for a new one). the psp is getting dominated by the nintendo ds, in games and in console sales. the ps3 is going to lose tons of market share to the xbox 360, because the former new kid on the block microsoft is a veteran now and knows what it has to do to cream sony. sony makes problem ridden hardware and is struggling. sony online is known for the worst mmo support ever (witness their totally inept and bungling mismanagement of a solid gold franchise in star wars galaxies). if it wasn't for the japanese mafia-style interwoven companies sony would have found itself shut out quite a while ago. the japan that can say no? how about the usa that will say no to sony when the xbox 360 comes out and the nintendo ds continues to crush the psp. the playstation 2 will be the last sony product i ever buy...i wish i would have had the foresight to buy an xbox instead of the ps2, it had better exclusive games (ninja gaiden, halo, jade empire, etc.) and was a more powerful and smoother system. sony= the new sega...\n",
      "Shouldn't Sony be focusing on the PS2?  Since they are diverting their resources to the PSTwo, the PS2 must be throwing in the towel.\n",
      "I GOT A PS2 AND I ONLY HAD IT FOR ONE YEAR AND BROKE. THEN, I GOT A REFUND AND BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE AND THAT BROKE WITHIN A YEAR TO!!! SO THATS WHY I DIDNT BUY ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BRAKE IN A YEAR TO. I DONT KNOW WHY IT STOPED WORKING THE STUPID PICE OF CRAP KEEPS SAYING ERROR READING DISC AND NONE OF MY PS2 GAMES WERE SCRATCHED UP!!!! SO DONT BUY IT!!!!\n",
      "In my country I could buy a console with a higher number (modern), but you send me one a little OLD.  So, this console get burn !!!.  I did not return this item because is very expensive for me, I live in Costa Rica.\n",
      "Sony failed to consider one thing for this redesign.....A FAN!!!!  I had to replace my original PS2, which finally died after about 5 years of abuse.  It took me forever to find one of the \"newer, slimmer\" PS2 consoles.  I did manage to buy one, and within 2 days of use, it died.  I took the stupid thing back for an exchange, but the EB Games where I bought it was out, so I got a refund.  (Great customer service by EB Games, by the way.)  I got to talking to the girl that was working there, and she said that these have been recalled because they have been overheating.  The fan that they put in it is just way too small to handle the heat generated by the unit, and the design is too small to allow proper heat dispersion.  Apparently Sony is being very hush-hush about the recall, but now I know why I couldn't find a single one at Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Target, HH Gregg, or K-Mart.  I was driving around all of Northeast Ohio for a day, getting more and more curious as to why none of these stores had any.  I didn't think it was because they were super-popular, and it seems as though it certainly wasn't that.  Way to go, Sony - Unleashing a redesigned piece of crap instead of just investing the time and dollars into developing the PS3.  Dummies.\n",
      "Xbox is for the serious gamers.  If you like crappy graphics, horrible online play, and little kid games like Rachet and Clink, Spongebob Squarepants, and Crash Bandicoot then my all means buy the Chumpstation.  If you are a serious gamer and like your unit with its own memory that you can download music to, online play that is insane, amazing graphics, more serious and adult games like Halo and Mechassualt then buy the XboxChumpstation 2 - Ages 4 - 9 yrs oldXbox - Ages 10 and over\n",
      "I unwittingly bought a PS2, not knowing that I'd get a god awfull small game controller. I used it for a month and now I can't hardly move my hands or my fingers. Don't buy Playstation 2.

      "this game is so badd i dont even want to talk about it one thing to say is the car control is horrible. whats a racing game with no car control. sega how could you let this one out of the door.AAAAAARRRRRRRHHHHHHGGGGGG!!!!!!!\n",
      "This game is so horrible. I loved the movies but this game is just horrible. It's not even worth a penny plus free shipping! Some of the atrocious things are the jumps, you can't jump over anything but you can jump even though you will never make it over anything. LJN just decided to put Marty McFly in a game and one of your weapons is throwing bowling balls!? When did Marty go around throwing bowling balls at people in the movie? Just stay away from this game at all costs.\n",
      "LJN has a bad reputation of medicore or terrible games but they made some decent or good games but this is one of their worst yet to come.Loosely based on the 1985 masterpiece \"Back to the Future\", it seems your in Hill Valley 1955 as you must try everything to collect clocks to save the time and your life from being erased from existence.In this game everything is out to get you from bullies, girls with hula-hoops, men with glass plates, bees and darts. Here Marty is all dressed up in black like a punk instead of wearing his red jacket like in the movies and the music in this game loops over and over again like it makes you a bit crazy. There's some good things in the game that help fight enemies such as bowling balls you can use to throw at them and bad things like the skateboard which makes you go fast but you can't stop as this game goes in a bit of \"Paperboy\"-esque route of racing. There's even some hard mini-games which is a breath of air from the horrible music playing such as the hit the bullies game which you have to kill 60 of them with milkshakes, a game where you have to avoid being seen by Marty's past mother and the hardest one where you play at the high school prom.All in all, it's a real piece of junk from LJN that should be avoided even if you are a fan of the movies.\n",
      "This game has nothing to do with the movie. The only thing famileur is the logo and the clock tower that arnt anything more then the start screens.You run through the streets and have to collect a bunch of clocks while avoiding running into the hooler hoops girls and killer bee's and the ever so deadly park bench.This game has nothing to do with the movie at all. It's more like a run and dodge 'em game like Frogger only on a scrolling screen that seem's to go absolutly no where.The next game was a little better, but still only 1 stars, but least that game had the deloreon in it.\n",
      "Back to the Future is one of the more popular movie franchises in...the movie industry. The game based off of the movie.....was a bombshell. It isn't even based off of the movie, since there's barely anything that relates to it.You play as a guy who's supposed to be Marty, but doesn't look like him. You walk through streets, collecting clocks and shooting bowling balls. That already sounds nothing like the movie. The music is as annoying as the game itself. It loops until you turn off the game.There is this one scene, however, where you play the guitar (In an awkward way), and different music plays. However, it's not Johnny Be Good. Instead, it's a garbled 8-bit mess.Could the game be any stupider? Yes, it can.\n",
      "Even if this game costs a quarter, stay away!!  NES produces crappy games from exciting movies on purpose and LJN is guilty for that!  Its a cruel marketing tool to get kids to spend their hard earn money on crappy games!  I played it once on a website that allows you to play NES games and boy the controls suck!  Its horrible!!  Why?  I'll tell you!-1 When did Marty sport a black shirt?  It would'nt hurt if these game developers make it red!-2 Creativity is horrible!  Throwing milkshakes at bullies, dodging hulla hoop girls, park benches, bumble bees, clumsy moving crews holding pieces of glass (that you can't see until you knock into them).......what more can I say!!  What kind of deadline was LJN tryin to reach!  No excuse!!-3 Graphics were horrible (even for 1989 NES game)!-4 Music score was horrible (same song loops over and over and it was'nt even in the movie)-5 Overhead view of game in play gives me a headace and jump button is worthless if you can't jump over anything!  Like I said, controls are akward!-6 Ending is short and it sucks!  After all that work, trying to beat this difficult and horrible game, you get a crappy ending.  Many LJN games for NES have these so beware!Don't buy this game!!  Also, stay away from the \"Mario Bros\" rip off sequel (II and III)!\n",
      "Do you like Paperboy, but hate the part of the game where you have to play as a paperboy? Then Back to the Future is the game for you!Forget about a story line. You start as some guy (I assume Marty?) running down the street. You have to dodge hoola-hooping women, charging beefcake men, and bees (or maybe humming birds). Just like in the movie, you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you! Occasionally you'll have a chance to grab a skateboard, but that just makes you crash quicker. Can you make it to the end of the block before 200 seconds runs out?The only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of Marty, his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen, which fades away as time passes. Of course, I only know this because I've seen the movie, and it really looks more like a picture of George Washington, Jack White and Nosferatu with a bad toupe (now that'd be a great game!). You have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading, which makes perfect sense.Let's say you make it through the five or so levels like this, which are all pretty much the same... It'll get you to Lou's Cafe (hey, something from the movie!), but that's when it gets even weirder. &#34;Bullies to go!&#34; it says as Marty walks in. He grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room. Then it says &#34;Boy, they sure threw you out in a hurry!&#34; and you have to replay the last street level. Once you beat it, this happens again! And each time, you lose a life until it's game over! Is it even possible to make it past this part of the game? After several attempts, I've concluded that no, it is not possible.If you want to flash back to a time when video games made no sense and slapped any random movie title on a cartridge so that it'd sell, then this is the game for you! But if you're looking for anything that has to do with Back to the Future - music, characters, story, a DeLorean - then you've come to the wrong place.But of course, 1985 was a simpler time, where video games were usually one or two impossible levels that created endless frustration... and we liked it that way!\n",
      "This NES game is nothing like the movie.  You ride a skateboard through a street and dodge very deadly objects, such as soda cans, bannana peels, kidney beans, etc..  That's it... the whole game is you on a skateboard, a side-scrolling screen, trying to avoid objects being thrown at you.  Why are objects flying at you? who the ---- knows????\n",
      "this is another tough gane not too exciting but my nephew likes it so I gave it to him.I wish the graphics were more like the nes bataman\n",
      "OK the NES controller is a good controller just don't buy it off amazon. You can get it cheaper at your local video game store or Ebay. Also you don't have to wait for shipping trust me staring at a NES knowing you can't play it is painful.\n",
      "This game has NOTHING to do with the epic looking cover label art. It is like this weird samurai ninja game where you can jump impossibley ( if thats a word ) high and kill monsters with a sword that is about the size of a butter knife.Dont play this is a horrible 3rd party game and a complete waste of money.\n",
      "A friend gave me money to order this for him. I personally didn't like this game. It's the worst in the Double Dragon series.\n",
      "Double Dribble is an awful basketball game despite what anybody says. I've hated it back then, and I hate it today. The controls are pretty choppy, and all the game amounts to: dunk, steal, dunk, and then some. The shooting is impossible to do; I just have a lot better chance making a dunk than shooting from anywhere else. My teammates are quite useless when it comes to playing defense. The only best part of the game is the dunking scene. But since I do it like every time, it gets really boring. What's with the halftime show? The game won't let me to skip that, forcing me to watch the dreadful display of cheerleading. All in all, playing Double Dribble is like trying to eat lots of mayonnaise and nothing else.\n",
      "Have you ever wondered why they didn't do an Uncle Fester spin-off movie where he fights aliens in a neighborhood? Guess they couldn't talk Hollywood into that no-brainer, so it must have gotten bumped down to the video game world. Hopefully Cousin It's Barber School Adventure is up next!This is one of those games that makes you wonder about the video game industry back in the day. Would they just greenlight anything that had a semi-recognizable name on it? Apparently yes. Or at least they'd take some crappy game and slap a name on it, because this clearly has no ties to the world of The Adams Family beyond the title.But let's put the story flaws aside and focus on the fact that the game is impossible to play. Fester only gets two life bars, which go fast when his laser gun (he has a laser gun) proves relatively ineffective on the aliens. You can shoot the non-moving ones four or five times to get an item, but even with upgrades I was unable to kill the jumping aliens (which look suspiciously like the Legend of Zelda jumping creatures). Each venture into the world lasted a minute or two, and once you die the game is over and you start again.Pressing pause only brings up further questions. You can select between a gun and a whip for a weapon, but I couldn't figure out how to change it. There are various items you can collect, including keys and money, but I never got anywhere that they could be used.As far as I can tell, this game is impossible to play... forget about playing through to the end, because even surviving five minutes seems like a grand achievement. Does Fester even have a quest beyond survival?This game ranks up there with Back to the Future and Karate Kid as one of the worst movie tie-ins ever. I mean, come on!\n",
      "I had the misfortune of getting this game back at the end 1989 for my NES. At that time, I also owned an Atari 800XL with Ultima III: Exodus and Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, which are really enchanting RPG, if you don't mind the crude graphics, so I was hoping Hydlide would be another Ultima, but boy was I wrong. Let's get with the music: it's some of the worst video game music I have ever heard! Cheap ripoff of the Indiana Jones theme song which keeps repeating itself over and over every 15 seconds. I never wanted to play this game unless the volume was turned off because the music will get on your nerves in no time flat. This &quot;music&quot; (which I refuse to think of as music) sounds like the worst garbage you'd hear from a music box. The graphics are very crude looking, and even for the 8-bit NES capability, it's really horrible (the graphics of Bionic Commando is miles better than this garbage). Heck, even the old Atari 8-bit adapation of the Ultima series looks better. How about playability? Well you have to run in to slimes and other monsters and press the A button to try to destroy them, but more chances than not, you'll end up killed. Often if you stand in the wrong vegetation, or you stand in the cemetary, your hit points drain without even monsters touching you (until you gain enough experience points). Basically in this game, you're supposed to collect all three fairies before you're able to kill the dragon. It took me ten years to finally win the game. That was in 1999, I finally won the game because I was finally able to find that third fairy. I didn't realize I was supposed to kill two wizards at once with the wave spell to get that last fairy. Perhaps the worst of this game is when you want to save it. You need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down. More chances than not you have written the password incorrectly and you pretty much lost what you accomplished in this horrible game. The Ultima series were wonderful, spellbinding RPGs (as long as you owned the Atari, Apple, or Commodore 64, rather than the NES or SNES adaptation). Hydlide is now regarded as not only the worst fantasy RPG ever made, but one of the worst ever made for NES. I have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking. Perhaps they were trying to cash in on the Legend of Zelda fad of the time and fell horribly flat. I have played much better NES games, including their adaptation of Willow, as well as Shadowgate, which means you are much better off checking out those games than Hydlide, unless you want to see just how bad games can get.\n",
      "There is a lot to be said about Hydlide, unfortunately all of it is bad. First off, the game breaks the standard that you don't touch enemies because it hurts you. In this game you hold the A button to change to attack mode and then blindly run into the enemy to hope that you win. If you die you lose everything and start all over from the beginning, and you will die a lot in this game.The sound is horrible, the music is the same seven second loop of a theme that sounds very much like the Indiana Jones theme song.The graphics are okay for the NES I suppose, I can't knock those too much since the system wasn't that powerful.The save system is misleading and led to a very angry me. In the menu there is an option to save, load and password. I hate passwords and so I just saved and quit. Well the carriage has no internal battery, so the save only works for if it is still on. You have to use the really long password to reload your game. And of course it changes every single time you access the password screen.I have only scratched the surface of the confusion and bad design choices that is Hydlide. If you find a good price and you think you might hate yourself, pick this up and see for yourself. I got my copy for a dollar, and I felt like that was almost too much.\n",
      "I am appalled at how poorly this game was designed. The story is just lame, and without the instruction booklet or a online FAQ/walkthroughm it is hard to figure out what you're supposed to do next because of the screwiness. Most games, one can easily figure out how to play it soon enough without a booklet, but this game was just awful. The whole running at enemies bit was just shoddy, and the seemingly random scavenger hunt for items seemed as if it was written by a idiot.The music, terrible. The level-ups, weak. The map/questworld, horrid. The controls... ugh. I seriously could not bring myself to continue this game, I quit about halfway because I just didn't want to waste my time anymore, not when this game had NOTHING to offer in way of fun or entertainment. This is easily one of the worst video games ever invented.\n",
      "All the Megaman games are way to dawn hard, esspessially MM 6 thats insane.  I have played all these and the only one I enjoyed and played alot was Megaman 5 on origional gameboy the rest just pissed me off.\n",
      "So this is considered the greatest Mega Man game ever.  Really?  I mean, REALLY?  No one has the balls to be objective?  I guess not, so I'll have to do it.  Suffering from \"more of the same\" syndrome, Mega Man 2 was little more than a retread of that which made the first Mega Man as irritating as it was, but a bit more playable, focused and inspired in the level structures, bosses and other necessities.  Gravity is still a harsh mistress to the Megster and the overall look of the game is still very mid-80s NES dreckish, but it was around this time that the series started to better itself by way of adding a few more elements to the series, namely the 8 boss rule, the various little tools that helps Mega Man traverse hard-to-reach areas, and those blessed E-Tanks.  Nevertheless, Mega Man 2 did really nothing more than keep the franchise afloat for another game until things started to REALLY take off...\n",
      "Hideo Kojima the creator of metal gear was NOT involved in making this version of metal gear! Check wikipedia if you are doubtful. This game was made by money grubbing game makers.Unlike all other metal gear games this one isn't about trying to be stealthy. It's an imitation of a run n'shoot type game. I repeat the creator of metal gear was not even involved in this. It's only metal gear by name.\n",
      "didn't work at all. we tried eighty ways from sunday to get it to play but it would just do a weird little demo.\n",
      "I could not believe how terrible this game was. The controlls are sloppy and the gameplay is horrible. You cant do anything. If you pick up a weapon or something you cant do anything with it. Avoid this game!\n",
      "This game is so so but the thing that kills it completely is the horrible, stupid controls.  Mario seems to have greese on his boots as he always slides of edges and makes crappy jumps to his death no matter what you do.  The graphics were pretty good for the time and the game is some what fun for about a half hour before it gets too repeditive to the point where you never want to see it again.  Mario 3 is the best one. This game only sold so many copies because it was shipped out with every NES  system.  Nintendo Entertainment System saved the gaming market not this crappy game.\n",
      "Super Mario Bros. 2 is absolutely horrible. Super Mario Bros. 3 is a lot better, but it's a little overrated... The original Super Mario Bros. Beats them both, easily! But Super Mario World is near-perfect, making them all seem like nothing. Mario has made a lot of great games in his day, but Super Mario Bros. 2 was a terrible failure. The graphics and sound are bad. The gameplay isn't what you'd expect from classic Mario games. Picking up enemies instead of stomping on them is too hard to do and takes too long. There aren't a lot of Power-ups, and they're not good power-ups either. Super Mario Bros. 1 and 3 are great, especially 1. If you really want to know how bad this piece of junk is, then get this: I can't think of A SINGLE good thing to say about Mario 2! The best quality in the game is poor quality.Presentation- 38/100Graphics- 49/100Sound- 35/100Gameplay- 15/100Replay Value- 9/100Overall- 23/100\n",
      "\"Dear God, please let this horrible game be a figment of my imagination\"Nope, it's real.  What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is.  For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things:One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says \"Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha\".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the \"just kidding\" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.  Well it's not.\n",
      "As a kid, I actually somewhat enjoyed this game.  It came to Nintendo's virtual console, so I decided why not download it for a change?  After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad.If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting.What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it.The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  If you need a classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fix, the first Turtles game on the NES isn't going to do it.\n",

      "NES Top GunHated this game growing up!  I never could land the freaking plane!Impossible.I got this game back in the mid 1980s when it came out.  I hated it.  Namely because I never could land the damn plane on the freaking aircraft carrier.For a mid 1980s game, it's a fairly decent, if boring, flight simulator.  But don't think you'll be getting a real flight simulator.  You just chose your plane, then you you fly in this big boring blue frame for a while, and try to dodge missles.  There's no real music.  That's the whole game.  There are four missions, but I only got to the third mission.  There's a good reason for that.But what makes this game so notorious for those who remember it (my generation, basically), is landing the plane on the aircraft carrier.  When you land the plane, you get a long approach, in which the game will continually tell you to press up or down on the control pad, to made sure you are aligned properly.  And no matter how meticulously you follow the instructions, YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CRASH.  I can remember being a little kid and getting so frustrated at this game because I could never land.  My brother landed once or twice, but that's about it.The other bad part is, I think in mission 3, you have to fuel midair when a big fuel plane comes up on top of you.  Just like landing, you have to press up or down to make sure the cable that will transport the gas from the fuel plane to your aircraft is properly aligned.  Just like the landing on the aircraft, you can never make the connection.  If the connection is not made, then the fuel aircraft will break the connection, leaving you to certain death as you will run out of fuel  before you reach the aircraft carrier, which you won't be able to land on anyway.The reason why I could never get past mission three is, if I remember correctly, you have three lives.  You lose the first two lives on the first two missions because you can't land, then you lose your life because you can't fuel.  I think the fourth mission has to do with a space shuttle, but I never knew any of my friends who had the game to get to that level.Just a really bad game.  Google Angry Video Game Nerd's review of it, he is, as usual, spot on (beware, he has a lot of adult language to the point his reviews are borderline obscene, but still funny as hell).Oh, also, this game has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE.  The movie even came out well before the game.  NO CONNECTION at all.\n",
      "The controls suck, the animations are terrible, all you can do is kick, punch and dropkick?  Theme music is the only good thing they got right here and it plays during the match.  The graphics are really bad, the difficulty is due to the crippling controls is horrid and overall there is zero enjoyment that can be had with this aweful game.\n",
      "It's been said that everyone has to start somewhere, but man, what a stinker of a starting point!  The prerequisites of all that is Mega Man are present; the multi-tiered platform stages, those wacky bosses, the \"rock-paper-scissors\" weapon mentality, and it all would've been great if it wasn't made with 1986 NES technology.  Many of the major sins present include slow and choppy scrolling, uninspired level art, repetitive level design, and Mega Man climbing a ladder way too slow and dropping like a rock when falling from a great height.  It could've been more, much MUCH more, and looking back after being spoiled on the later games it's hard to consider this the genius it was meant to be.\n",
      "If only it were possible to rate a zero, this game would have earned it. Not only should this game NEVER have been made, every copy found to exist should be destroyed. It's an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of Nintendo. Yeah, I'm a fan of Zelda. No, I don't like easy games. I like games which challenge my skill & intellect, not my patience & sanity. I disliked Zelda II when it first came out but gave it a second chance when offered as a free download to my 3DS from Nintendo. After a very solid second shot, it's now deleted from my system. Where can I even begin?? There are no rewards for defeating opponents. The control is appalling. There's no strategy involved. It's too easy to get hurt, almost impossible to heal, and no matter where you are in the game, dying forces you to start over at the beginning. This isn't a game. This is a violation of the Geneva Convention. Unless you have a mental disorder which causes you to enjoy having to complete the same monotonous tasks OVER AND OVER, don't bother. In fact, the game could even cost you hundreds to play. For some, the torment & frustration could cause you to destroy a perfectly good console. It wouldn't have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game. It's as though the designers were TRYING to kill the Zelda license. Thank God it survived to have a third title. But the second title should have been recalled & buried.\n",

      "I loved Secret of Mana, the earlier Mana game on the Super Nintendo, and loved it -- among many other Square games. I was really happy to get my hands on this new Mana game... but I am incredibly disappointed in it!The game has no storyline. After a neat intro, you control a very generic guy or girl character (named &quot;YOU&quot;) that rarely speaks. You choose a spot on a blank map for your home, then place other areas of the game on joining spaces, eventually building up a big world.Other characters in the game come and go as little &quot;mini-quests&quot; pop up (bookended by a cute title and little &quot;The End&quot; scene whenever you complete the quest). Completing the quests basically consists of walking around an area on your map and killing enemies and a boss enemy.This brings up the battle system, which is a step back from Secret of Mana. Instead of the fast-paced gameplay of SoM, you are drawn into little battles when you near enemies. Battling mainly consists of pushing buttons quickly while near enemies. The graphics don't allow for much detail, so any sense of strategy is hopeless. You have little real control over the other characters in your team (unless you go through the trouble of setting up two-player play, which is often more hassle than it's worth).The graphics are nice, though incredibly happy. Still, it is as if players are controlling a small part of a nice piece of animation... the animation, however, has no plot or sense of coherency. The graphics do not make up for the incredibly bad gameplay and lack of story.Even if you were a fan of Secret of Mana or love Square's other games, do not rush out and buy Legend of Mana. Instead rent the game and, if you like what you see, then consider buying it. I am disappointed I bought the game without previewing it first. I don't think I would have wanted to see the game through after seeing its poor quality.\n",
      "Despite all that, there is a right way to do them, as well as the wrong way, which they just did.  If you want a plot that works, make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes, but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done, and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd, and make the story alter entirely.  Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town, solve the puzzle, hear a bunch of drivel that doesn't add up to anything else in your head, get the item and build a new town.  The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played, but what did that have to do with anything.This is an example of a good nonlinear plot:You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord. The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord (base plot).  Now as you set out, you're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident. You get arrested for animal cruelty, and put in prison.  So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free, and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes, that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses, so under her tutelage, you become a career criminal.  OR you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink, but she has a change of heart and drug it instead.  You get sent as a slave to be a gladiator, but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war.  OR you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlord's castle only it seems the townspeople were lying, the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town, and put an end to it, and he has proof. So you march right back tothe town and see that he was right.This is nonlinear plotline, the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game, even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero.  Assume the hero died in the thief story, the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl, and her adventures.\n",
      "I was very disappointed in the technical aspects of this game. I really enjoyed &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, and I thought that I would enjoy this one as well. Unfortunately, getting the disk to run was a MAJOR nightmare!  After spending an hour and a half trying to get the game to start (the game  required me to change and configure audio drivers, without giving any help  doing it!), I was finally able to get it to go, but even then the sound was  pretty much shot. Other problems I had with it: 1) it wouldn't remember the  sound settings that took forever to change. When I would try to play the  next time, I would have to &quot;uninstall&quot; the game and reinstall -  losing any saved games!  2) The puzzles, when I could access them, were  INSANELY hard! Without the help of a good cheat guide, forget it!All in  all, it looked like it had potential but I would NOT recommend this to  ANYONE! What were the designers thinking? Give me a game that I can just  stick in and play!\n",
      "Let me first say, I love Sim City 2000 and 3000. I am one of those guys who waited for 6 years for 3000 to come out. And it was...ok, not great but ok. Maxis had promised all kinds of things like a transportation package that would let you build monorails...where is it? Another thing, this is  the 3rd installment-excuse me, 4th installment, and you still see the same  buildings over and over again in your city? Oh come on! If you have Sim  City 3000, dont spend money on this. Aside from the building creator that  you can download and buildings you can also get from others, there really  isnt anything new here worth plunking down $. Thumbs down!\n",
      "Don't get me wrong Sim City 2000 was great I loved it.  But this game is just Sim City 2000 with better graphics.  Thats all I have to say.  Im mad I bought it when I already have Sim City 2000.  Oh yea you can not make farms, I tried, its imposible.\n",
      "This game was so icky I didn't even finish it.  The rendered characters all appeared to have some sort of unhealthy skin condition, and tended to rock back and forth while delivering their bad voice bits.  The locations were pretty, but the node-to-node navigation was extremely frustrating.  Some of the puzzles weren't too bad, but others were pretty far fetched.  Between the creepy characters, the dizzying navigation and the inane puzzles, I just couldn't bring myself to continue.\n",
      "Wow, what a let down.  Having played and enjoyed both Mario party games on the N64, I was looking forward to seeing what the dreamcast could do with a sonic board game. While Sonic and friends have never really reached the same level of character recognition as the Mario and Luigi crowd, I was hoping the graphic muscle of the DC would at least squeeze some light hearted fun out of Sonic Shuffle. What we found when we played for many hours last night was dissappointment and frustration. First, the graphics look just plain bad in my opinion.  The opening shots and menus look promising but the actual game screens made me think I had seen better on the N64.  In particular, some of the environmental effects like water looked awful, like the animations were running about 4 frames per second.  Very choppy and unpleasant to stare at while you are waiting  for the computer players to take their turns.  You can't turn them off by the way, so there is no such thing as short game.  Between that and the long load times, you can expect to be spending alot of time just sitting around yawning.It's the gameplay, stupid!  Even with lousy looks, this game could have emerged from the depths if it had good, engaging gameplay.  Instead, this is an example of what NOT to do in a video game.  Without going into great detail, I will say the the computer players cheat, the mini-games leave you with no control over your characters, and ultimately the complete random, unexplained nature of why and when things happen will make you feel like you are completely out of control of your character's fate.  You may as well just sit back and watch what happens, because nothing you can do will really effect anything. This game is one of the worst I have seen to come from the folks at SEGA, who recently have been putting out some fantastic games- Jet Grind Radio and Skies of Arcadia would make me buy my system all over again. I'm thinking that maybe Sonic Shuffle was made by some sub-team of developers working in some broom closet in the basement of the Sega building. They should be fired or sent back to game design school.\n",
      "I have Mario Party 1 and 2 and they came out befoe this.Sonic Shuffle is a mario party wannabe.The mini games stink on ice.And its pointless,all you do is pick a card and it walks by itself.If you wanna good sonic game get sonic adventure 2.This has bad graphics and takes a long time to play.\n",
      "When I first read about Sonic Shuffle it got mixed reviews but since I was desperate for a new experience in gaming for the Dreamcast (the best system that never made it) I bought the game. I must say that it has sweet cel shading graphics and thats it! This game is really uninspired and tedious! My biggest gripe (among many) is that THE MULTIPLAYER GAMES ARE BORING, UNINSPIRED AND JUST PLAIN SUCK!!!!!!!!!!! I was origionally drawn to it by the boasts of many mulitplayer games but boy was I fooled! There are probably three (if so much) of these games that are fun, trust me the mini ames are BAD!! One game puts three players in a frying pan and the fourth player gets to turn it and toss it as if they are making pancakes, WEAK SEGA, WEAK!DO NOT BUY THIS MESS!!! IT IS NOT FUN!!!TAILS IS THE MOST ANNOYING CHARACTER EVER CREATED I HATE THE WAY HE ALWAYS HAS TO CALL SONIC FOR EVERYTHING!!!SOMEONE AT SEGA SHOULD GET A CAREER CHANGE AND GO INTO LICKING ENVELOPES AT THHE POST OFFICE, A JOB THAT REQUIRES LITTLE THOUGHT BECAUSE HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO PUT INTO SONIC SHUFFLE TO MAKE IT ORIGIONAL OR FUN!!\n",
      "I am a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog.  I have been there for better and for worse (like when they added the super-annoying Amy Rose as a character).  I have always liked Sonic as a video game character.Nonetheless, this game is awful. First of all, the premise of this game is stolen from the game Mario Party.  Cloned games can be alright, considering that the developers don't rely too heavily on the origial game for inspiration and design.  Sadly, the makers of Sonic Shuffle do exactly that--they rely completely on the design of Mario Party to patent their game after.  They make no attempt to hide the fact that they are copying off of Mario Pary.And when game developers create a clone, it should be equal or better than the original, or else, they'll have to deal with the fact that not only did they not have the creativity to make their own game, but they could not even use the success of the game that was their predecessor to create a successful game in their own right.  Sonic Shuffle is a textbook example of this.The game boards are pointless and poorly conceived.  The story behind the game is uninspiring, and does not catch the imagination.  The minigames are stupid, and not entertaining in the least.I would avoid this game at all costs, unless you want to give someone free money for a useless piece of software.  Or maybe you could use the CD as a designer coaster or something.\n",
      "I got Perfect Dark for the N64 the day it came out and was actually surprised that it was better than I had expected. When I saw the same title for Gameboy, I figured it would be a portable version of the great N64 game.Boy, was I wrong. This is easily the worst game I own. The controls don't work, the sound isn't good, and the game play is horrible. Almost entirely the opposite of what the N64 game was. In fact, really the only thing in common between the two is the title and main character.In short, if you liked the N64 version, don't bother with this game. If you hated the N64 version, I suppose you might like this.\n",
      "There is nothing perfect about this game, so that right there is false advertising.  Anyway, how fun can a game be that allows you to get shot from an enemy who is shooting you while rushing in from off screen?  Sound fun?  Well, no, it's not.  Gameboy color games are pretty weak across the board...I'd stick to the Advance.  Perfect Dark is just [mindless].\n",
      "When the Transfer Pak was initially introduced for the Nintendo 64, there were very few games that used it. Pok&eacute;mon Stadium and Mario Gold (see reviews) were the first ones, and Mario Tennis was coming. At the time, I had recently bought Perfect Dark for the N64, and I'd heard that the GBC version would use the Transfer Pak. Based on that, I bought the GBC game. Oops.My first mistake was expecting an N64-type experience from this game, and that's simply not possible. Perfect Dark was so good for the N64 that it couldn't be translated well for the Game Boy. However, it could still be a good game in its own right. Well, it's not.The controls, to say the least, are poor. It's difficult to aim, difficult to tell where you're aiming, hard to tell what's happening, hard to see where items are to pick up. It's just difficult to play. I couldn't even force myself to go through the first level.The sound is nothing spectacular, and while the cut scenes are interesting, the graphics themselves are poor. The cartridge also comes with a built-in Rumble feature, but that really doesn't add anything to the game other than weight.I can't recommend this game in any way, even for its ability to unlock features in the N64 game (which I couldn't find in the GBC manual and will accept on faith). It's simply not worth it. If you need to get into things in the N64 version, find some cheat codes on-line and save yourself some money.\n",

Shouldn't have done that.)And so far, I can't even get the game to play. I installed and uninstalled twice. I have downloaded updated drivers for NVIDIA GEFORCE FX 5200 128meg video card. I have changed all of the settings over and over again. And still can't play. I see the beginning story in the aftermath that follows the end of Homeworld, of them rebuilding. But as soon as I see the ship fly in on the first cutscene, I get kicked back to Windows.My recommedation is if you have XP, don't get this game. So far, it's more trouble than it's worth.

The time frame is not paced, and the options are not as smooth as the package  promotes.  Bad production indeed!  And the biggest factor that it fails to  anywhere close to fun.\n",
      "I am not much of a game expert, but I do know what I like to play. I decided I wanted the game because the concept of running my own airport would be fun. I even read a few of the reviews on amazon. My husband seen the game at [local store] including in a pack with other games. He only paid [some money] for the pack and I see why.  First the box said airport tycoon, but the cd saids Air Mogul. I guess it is the same game. When I first seen the graphics it was awful. I still thought there would be hope. The game play is not easy to understand and the game tutorial was worthless in fact it was mess up itself. I just didn't like it at all. I was very disappointed. So if you are just a person who like to play games just for the fun of it, and not one of those hard gamers don't waste your money on this game. It wasn't even worth a few dollars. Now one of the other games in the pack I am currently playing is RailRoad Tycoon 2 and it was definitely worth the few dollars.\n",

Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again.\n",

The problem I have most with the game is serge the main character never talks, that is just plain lazyness you just get the feeling that serge is just  lifeless and is not intristing at all. Since the game has so many characters in it, it seems that most of the other characters as lifeless as serge and have no pointe in ever bieng introduced to the plot.I feel thair is a limit to the number of characters in a game that will still make the game intristing. And I am sorry Game Informer, but this game does not restore my faith in the modern RPG(you have to read thair great magazine to know what I am talking about) Square could do better, I have seen it done.\n",

This is a waste! A waste of time and money, for Sierra and the consumers! I'm only talking about the product, Counter-Strike is actually not a bad mod, since about 90% of the Half-Life gaming community plays it, there is no room for other mods. This is bad for the people that are tired of Counterstrike and are looking for something new.Buying Half-Life by itself is cheaper, you can download Counterstrike for free anyway.\n",
      "Counter-Strike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game.  Half-Life, though somewhat outdated now, is still one of the best FPS games ever made.  The gameplay is superb, and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right.  Counter-Strike is one of those great mods.  Counter-Stike is so great, that Sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game.  This is why I am giving this only one star, in spite of the spectacularness of the game.  Go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded, and you can get this game, provided you have Half-Life, for free.  Yes for free.  The file however, is fairly large, but even so, it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game.  Basically, this game is great, and though it is worth the price, it is still available for free, so that price isn't worth it.\n",

Let me compare this to my favorite racing game F-Zero GX, yah sure F-Zero GX was hard but hot damn it is amazing, a wide variety of vehicals to play with, unique tracks incredible speed and hand sweating action, ridge racer 5 on the other hand is boring, a boring selection of cars, a boring selection of tracks, all in all its just really lazy. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE RACING ITSELF, this is one of those games if you fall back in last place, THERE IS NOT CHANCE TO GET BACK TO FIRST, the AI is terrible, they always get ahead of you, and you cant get ahead of them. This makes an already boring game frustrating. In F-Zero GX even though the game has insane level design you still at least had a chance to catch up because you know, the game is fast. Ridge Racer 5 is slow, and boring, and frustrating, its not even worth a damn penny.F-Zero GX\n",

I didn't know what to expect, but cars that handle EXTREMELY unrealistically, graphics that are just average in my eyes (compared to NFS 2 Hot pursuit and GT 3) and a general unexpected hardness in gameplay made me sorry I got this game. The cars are fake, which isn't too much of an issue but you have to make the fake cars good. If you're looking for a fun racing game with realistic cars, go for Need For Speed 2: Hot Pursuit, and if you want a good driving sim, go for Gran Turismo 3.

Also whats going on with all the jumping I feel like I'm on the 8th level on Super Mario Bros,not a Castlevania game,the difficultly was unpleasant and the level design was unforgivable.In addition what who ruined the Castlevania music with this techno garbage,unless you like gay techno(which is all techno by the way)you will be looking for a mute button.

      "While i do like the PS 2 line up of games the system itself i have lost all confidence in.My first two PS 2's (the old bigger version) died from the disc read error problem.I thought maybe in the new design this problem was addressed since the laser lens is more easily accesible and you'd think that would make it easy to clean it and stuff.Well the new slim i bought a year ago just stopped reading discs to and i tried to clean the laser lens and it has no effect whatsoever.I have bought 3 playstation 2's in the last 4 years.If i buy another one it will be my 4th in 4 years and will bring up my total spent on new PS 2's to about 800 dollars.More then it costs to buy the upcoming PS 3 on a much lesser system.Conveniently they die on me after the warranty is gone.I have 200 games that are all dust collectors now cause i refuse to buy another PS 2 again.They have no durability whatsoever and the life of the systems i have owned seems to be just over a year on each.Thats not acceptable.I take good care of my systems and it doesn't matter.With time the PS 2's just stop reading discs for whatever reason.Then they want you to buy another one or ship it somewhere to be fixed (and charge you for it of course).If it was an isolated thing with one faulty system i would have no problem with it.But when all three systems i buy die from the same exact problem thats not acceptable.Theres an obvious flaw in the building of this system and Sony simply refuses to address it and fix the problem where it starts in manufacturing.Because people keep flocking to the store to but them Sony won't bother to fix it cause as long as they see profits that translates to them as being no problem with the system.My advice is to avoid Sony console systems until they one day show they can create one with some durability.Especially with the new PS 3,if that one ends up having the same flaw as this system its going to cost alot more to keep replacing.For the time being Sony systems are a bad investment.They just don't have long lasting durability.My original Nintendo lasted longer then all 3 of my PS 2's combined which is pretty sad considering that the first nintendo had a bad reputation for durability.\n",
      "I got this game after purchasing a PS3, thinking that even if this game wasn't all that great, I could use the two microphones (which came with a USB adaptor) for Karaoke Revolution games.  I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these \"SingStar\" mics.Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are \"medleys\", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.Conclusion.  This is NOT a Karaoke game, as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals, and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3.  If I was given the option, I would give this game ZERO stars.\n",
      "I really, truly, do not understand how Settlers has managed to get to a fourth release. I would have thought this game would have died out after the first. Everything about the game is annoying and confusing. You need to produce all sorts of resources from different spots, and it's not clear when you need to produce something you're not. This can lead to a lot of head-scratching while you try to figure out why exactly your miners aren't mining. You really don't have that much control of the individual units the way you do in almost every good strategy game. The combat is dull and not particularly tactical, and the graphics are pretty dated. Most of all, this game just isn't fun. It feels more like a tutorial in a free market economy than a game! Pick up Civ 3 or Age of Empires 2 if you want an historical strategy game.\n",
      "It's a shame.  Looks like this could be a good game but after installing the whole game, it just would not run on my computer.  After reading the reviews, I'm leary about installing patches - so I just uninstalled.  BioWare should never have released a game that works only on certain computers?\n",
      "The game crashed my hard drive and forced me to BUY a new one.All of that happened after I unsuccessfully tried to install and run the game. I have a computer and engineering background, so this senario is not typical for me!  I know what I'm doing and if it takes too long or if it crashes, most likely, it's not my fault!The whole installation process was lagged (it would take several seconds for every move you'd make to respond) ... in the middle of the installation I was already frustrated but decided to finish it all the way, and then restart my system and see if it made any difference.Well, it didn't.I tried any display settings I could think of.I updated (or checked for updates) on all my drivers.I double checked anything I could possibly think of ...and at the end, the game ran slower than a snail ... and to add insult to the injury, the next thing I knew, the infamous blue-screen was there!!!  Last time I had a \"blue microsoft screen\" I was running windows NT, not XP!!  Need I say that I was never able to recover my computer, or the data on my harddrive? I had to buy a new hard drive as the old one had been damaged beyond repair and ended up losing lots of data.You've been warned! Buy and install at your own risk.\n",
      "Neverwinter Nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense.  It's more of an electronic version of the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.  If you are an avid D&D; player who can't get your group together at your own house, you now have the internet to do it.  While this is fine for pen and paper D&D; groupies, the rest of us are left out in the cold.Basically, Neverwinter Nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow.  The game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own D&D; adventures.  Either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods (there are already 500+ available online), you can play Neverwinter Nights by yourself or online with a group of players.  To further enhance the pen and paper D&D; experience, there is even a dungeon master client in the game.  If you don't know what a dungeon master is I can already tell you you're purchasing the wrong game.  Basically, a DM watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players.  Sort of like an invisible referee.This all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but I'm not sure it really works.  For one thing, while the editor has a lot of capabilities, every map has that same square-look to it to fit in the D&D; grid system.  Nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods you've seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself.  Also, for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures, the editor is more difficult than it should be.  If you don't know programming basics, you're going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple C+ programming.  To accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors, Neverwinter Nights also has a new 3-D system that reminds me of hack and slash games like Diablo more than the company's previous classic release Baldur's Gate I and II.  In fact, the official campaign included in the game is NOTHING compared to the Baldur's Gate games and I would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play.  The included campaign is boring, linear and not that creative, it's more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventure.If you plan on only playing online, be careful if you only have a 56K modem.  You'll never be able to host more than 3 players on your computer without lag.  Also, you'll have a difficult time joining the large servers with 20+ players if your connection is slow.  Neverwinter Nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category.  You can join the action channel, the roleplaying channel, etc.  Most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of Everquest. While they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment, quests, etc., they never provide much fun.  The best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper D&D.;  While you can find people to play with through online fan sites, you'll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled times.After trying this game for a month, frankly, I feel cheated.  I bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they didn't want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the company's other epic releases Baldur's Gate I and II.  That's a misleading claim because the new mechanics of Neverwinter Nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the company's previous PC D&D; games.  This game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of D&D;, the rest of us should move on to Icewind Dale II or Morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer RPG as fantastic as the Baldur's Gate series.\n",
      "alright i thought. a true AD&D; game from the company that created the classic baldur's gate series and other great games that ran well on my computer.unfortunately, this game barely runs on my mid-high range system. the game literally stutters along with constant 2-3 second pauses.i find that many of the other people in the bioware tech support problem were having the same issue without a response from bioware.after much research, i discovered there is only one solution to this problem and this consists of using a third-party graphics program (costs about 20 bucks to register). this program will not allow you to see any of the in-game movies and the performance is still slow, sluggish and just unplayable.to play this game, it comes down to either buying new hardware, waiting months for a patch that might not be released or just returning it. from what i've read on here and elsewhere, i see that this game isn't even worth playing even if it ran flawlessly on my system (to save space i won't repeat what others have said).my advice: get warcraft III. if you want a real authentic AD&D; experience, play in real life for now as this game doesn't provide it even if it runs smoothly on your system.\n",
      "I don't see how anyone could possibly like this game. I couldn't get into it after several tries. The game play is the worst thing about it, the perspective is awful, movement sucks, one fight can last a very long time, even it's foundation is bad and even that is being generous. I see that many people like it, but the old infinity engine games are so much better in so many different ways. I don't even like them, but they hands down beat this game. It's a big step in a very bad direction for the series. It might have a lot of depth for all I know, but it's so terrible that I couldn't find out. Playing it was like being repeatedly stabbed with pins, it drags on and on. It's incredible how narrow, boring, slow, drab, and awful it is. The best things about it even make it worse. After playing Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale 1 & 2, Dragonshard, and Demon Stone this is by very very far the worst of the bunch. I wish there was some redeeming quality to mention here. Usually I try to throw in some good point no matter how bad something is, but I really can't come up with anything at all. I've played video games my whole life and I would rather play pong than this waste of space.\n",
      "It has that bulder's gate blahh feel to it.  Very slow moving.  I have an extremely high-end system and it moves very slowly, just as bulder's gate does.  What is the fascination with that style of game???  Sure it uses ad&d rules but it does it so gruelingly slowly!...  Anyway, I played Arcanum for a day and the novelty of the ability to fire a gun in an RPG wore off due to the terrible interface.  Top that off with the ... quality of the Sierra name (it's become apparent they rush developers into releasing buggy low-quality software with cool packaging - cheers to their marketing company!) and you're looking at one crummy game.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.\n",
      "Stuttering graphics, severe slowing during actions, cheesy graphics you'd expect from about 5 or 6 years ago......[PRICE]Not only that, multiplayer is practically nonexistant, the patches are extremely unreliable, game freezes AFTER the patches............Take my advice.........stay away from this and all other Sierra Products.  Keep in mind, this is the same company that came out with the little gem Rage of Mages.............\n",
      "I like Poke'mon, but do not buy this game! The peoffesor runs the whole thing, Pikachu never listens, there is a time limit (...).  Be smart, don't buy it!\n",
      "So, to most of the GR readers, I'm warning you to stay away. It's the video game equivalent of going to the library and reading a Golden Book instead of Tolstoy. But if you have a really young sibling or even a child of your own who definitely likes Pikachu and can bear all his long term annoyances, there might be a possible Christmas present there.\n",
      "the reason i don't like majora's mask is because it has a ridiculous story line. first of all you have to do all this junk to get certain things. plus you have to stop the moon from smashing into the earth that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.this game is not loyal to all the previous zelda games nor does it have any returning characters such as  princess zelda. ocarina of time is without a doubt better than majora's mask.\n",
      "It is sad to say the least that what made this game horrible was the fact that there was time added!! How does it ever make sense that you have temples lodead with many things to get not to mention going into ten different rooms just to get to an enemy yet you only have 72 hours game time to complete the task?! Not to mention side quests and loads of things to do. The sotry line was cool and the graphics were great but this comes nothing close to Ocarina Of Time which I enjoyed sooo much! In fact I think Ocarina Of Time was waaaaaay better then this. If you are going to make a game make the ememies hard and the task difficult but don't add time. Picture if you were half way through a temple and were almost done then time runs out!! That would make you want to pull your hair!! Thankfully from the looks of future games I have seen they did not make that fatal mistake again! I recomend to buy Orcarina Of Time better!\n",
      "I hereby pronounce the Zelda series dead.  Ocarina of Time had bestowed upon me a premonition that perhaps Zelda's death as a series would soon come to pass in the near future, and Majora's Mask confirmed my sinking feeling in such an exact and nauseating manor as only a truly pathetic game can.First of all, Zelda doesn't belong in 3D.  It robs the player of the ability to be aware of everything in the room, an ability that is VITAL to the Zelda motif.  I've said this about Ocarina of Time, and I say it now about Majora's Mask.Not only that, but you'll spend less than half the time with any actual gameplay (dungeons and the like).  About half of this game consists of wandering around Clock Town solving people's problems for them like some kind of deranged therapist.  While I'll admit that the roots of this element are plainly visible in the most brilliant installment in the Zelda series (A Link to the Past, naturally!), it has now been carried WAY too far.The third and final majorly boneheaded move in Majora's Mask is the revival of an ancient gaming abstraction that should have been left dead and buried: the time limit.  Nothing good can come of such a thing.  Any game with a time limit is not a leisurely activity as a video game should be, but a frantic scramble.  BEING FRANTIC IS NOT FUN, people.That's the last of my major gripes, but the problems don't end there.  For example, both Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are quite depraved; did you know that?  WHAT IS THIS STUPID SPIDER OBSESSION?  Guess what Nintendo, it's DISGUSTING!  I hated the Deku Tree, and now I hate that god-awful thing in the swamp.  Being obsessed with spider webs is just plain CREEPY.  (I don't even want to KNOW what kinds of \"activities\" they were performing as they envisioned fantasies of those spiders in their heads!)\n",
      "If you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like Beavis & ButtHead,then look no further than this disaster of a game.Once a lovable squirrel that fought acorns,poor Conker has been turned into a furry Beavis(or furry ButtHead)and generally staggers through the game,accomplishing absolutely NOTHING.And that's just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbage-you'll constantly feel that you're not getting anywhere and that you're not accomplishing a single thing.In the game,all you do is get drunk,swear,stagger around,puke and have a hangover-all through the entire game.You'll start to feel like you're in the animal version of Beavis & ButtHead(remember how much Beavis & ButtHead love to swear,do drugs and get drunk?),and you'll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment is.Unlike \"Conker's Pocket Tales\",there are no goals to accomplish,there is no plot,and there is absolutely NOTHING to do except swear,get drunk,puke and have a hangover.Despite how much people try to get you to believe that \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" is the greatest game around,you'll learn the truth about this game:That it's just a big promotion for alcohol.Do yourselvwes a favor and get \"Conker's Pocket Tales\" instead.If you want a REAL M-rated game,then get Grand Theft Auto.\n",
      "This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!\n",
      "Conker's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game, but guess what? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie. This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen.\n",
      "paper mario is very boring at the end of the game there is nothing else to do you can't get more exp points.this game has horrible graphics i don't give a damn if it's paper. there is really nothing to do at the end of the game.\n",
      "This is the WORST game I played. At first I thought this game would be excellent because I LOVED Super Mario for the SNES. When I put the game in, I wasted so much time on a LONG and boring intro that you HAVE to watch. 2nd Mario talks to EVREYBODY in the game, which adds to more boredom. May I also include there is no sound? 3rd, everytime Mario has a battle with a stupid bad guy, it goes into a scene similar to Pokemon. You do your attack, than Mario gets attacked himself! What is that?! If I made the game, I would just make it so Mario and him fought normally!4th, the graphics are just terrible.5th, the music REALLY got on my nerves.So ignore the majority of people that say it is the best.  In my opinion, the game is sad and just disgraces the N64.\n",
      "Don't let the cool box art fool you. This game is just the opposite of what the box art suggests. It suggests fun, great visuals, and a stellar, epic storyline. In (game) reality, the fun comes in very small, almost untraceable doses, the visuals offer a palette of dark colors that blend the setting with characters and items, and the storyline is neither epic nor stellar. If that doesn't chase you from the game, then the rest of this review most definitely will.The Good:+ The level-up system is actually rather good+ The dialogue will make you laugh--whether it's meant to or notThe Bad:-- Somebody let this game out into the market-- Long sequences of boring combat-- Many people might not even find their way out of the first castleThe Ugly::( The character and monster designsStoryline--1/10Unfortunately the script-writers don't provide the characters with any intelligent dialogue. In fact, it's laughable. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, which makes things even worse. Take for example what the main character, Alaron, says when the party stops to rest. They sit before a campfire and the camera zooms on Alaron's face. He says, \"Ah! Pass the marshmallows.\" Not only is this not very funny, but it grows annoying when you have to watch this scene every time your party rests. The best line of dialogue, though, belongs to the knight, Abrecan. When the king sends Alaron on a quest and offers as a reward to make Alaron (who is at the time a squire) a knight, Abrecan objects. He continuously insults his king by saying, \"You are too generous.\" And each time he repeats those words, more and more of them become capitalized, expressing Abrecan's abhorrent anger for the king allowing this young squire a chance to become a knight. Compared to that line of dialogue, nothing else is worth remembering.Gameplay--1/10Many of you may not find your way out of the labyrinthine castle you start out in, but for those who do you'll do some questing and searching through the not-so-labyrinthine-but-still-difficult-to-navigate outside areas. Most importantly, you'll be battling bad guys. That's what you bought the game for, right? To battle bad guys? For this, the game developers bumped their heads together and thought, \"What is so fun about video games?\" They made a list, narrowed it down to \"What's so fun about RPGs,\" and then, for the fun of it, made a list of \"What would not be fun in an RPG.\" But somebody accidentally slipped this last list to the developers and threw out the other one. Thus the combat that lasts 10 to 20 minutes and consists of lots swinging and missing. I swear, the chance to hit in this game is about as low as the chance to miss in other games. There are so many factors that go against your chance to hit that there just is no hitting. And when you reach a high enough level to actually start hitting the enemies, you move on to the next area where the enemies are stronger and, thus, harder to hit. ARGGHH!!! Back to square one.On the bright side, the experience system is rather good. You can put points into different skills for each character, giving you a lot of freedom for customization. Too bad the rest of the game couldn't have been so fun and original.Longevity--1/10As I said, many of you will probably never leave the castle, where poor Alaron will breathe his last, but for those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to make it out and go on your quest, there's a lengthy quest here. Much of it consists of long battles between incompetent fighters, and very little of it consists of an engaging story. In the end, it would be much more merciful to allow Alaron to live out the rest of his days lost in the castle.\n",
      "lets just get this straight when i bought royal rumble i was looking for the next smackdown.One problem it nothing like smackdown first of all there are only 2 modes a regular one on one match or a royal rumble where there can be 9 people in the ring at one time. Yes i know the royal rumble match sounds cool but it is as boring as a one  on one match.In other words this game gets one star for being fun for 5 minutes.\n",
      "Well it's safe to say that all the WWF games for the dreamcast.  Just keep on walking and get something else.\n",
      "For those of you who actually like Royal Rumble for the Dreamcast I must say that you are deprived! If you want the best wrestling game on the Dreamcast go track down \"Fire Pro D Wrestling\", an import game.This game has over 200 wrestlers and the most indepth create a player mode found in ANY wrestling game. Heck you can even edit the origional given wrestler costumes, wanna see Bret Hart in a blue jeans, then just edit one of his costumes. Wanna see the Rock in a shiny gold shirt and long black dress pants, then just edit one of his costume choices. You can edit costumes for everyone if you like, from Andre the Giant to Hulk Hogan to Dallas Page to Goldberg to Vader to Shawn Michaels to Chyna to Ric Flair to Y2J to Hawk and Animal and any of the japaneese wrestlers.EVERYTHING you want in a wrestling game is HERE!! It also supports 4 players and NEVER suffers from any slowdown.The cast of characters Fire Pro D range from stars from the WWF, WCW, UFC (yes Ultimate Fighter Championships) and numerous wrestling organisations in Japan. This game rocks! There are numerous game modes like Royal Rumble, Battle Royal, Survivor Series, 3 man tag, 4 man tag, 2 man tag, single match, cage match, barb wire match, submission matches and MORE. This has the MOST moves per character in ANY wrestling game. I dare any Smackdown fan to compare the two, they will loose BADLY!!!Overall the game is what a wrestling game on the Dreamcast should be and not the disappointing mess called Royal Rumble!!IMPORT THIS GAME, ITS A MUST HAVE!!!\n",
      "This has to be the worst WWF wrestling game i have ever played. Their are no create a wrestler options, no season modes, limited choices in wrestlers.control get screwed up at times. the game certainly does not take advantage of the Dream Cast hardware. I've played this game for about 30 minutes and simply became disgusted. Do yourself a favor and get something else\n",
      "I am serious. This game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to WCW Nitro for Playstation but it ranks up there with it. This game has two modes, no endings, 20 Characters, no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured Smackdown. I suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it. THQ failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is 4 stars. THIS GAME IS BAD! And this is coming from a gamer of 20 years....\n",
      "American Idol could be the worst game of the year, just by the looks of it.. Look at how bad it is. The grapics are horrible. They are some of the worst graphics ever seen on Playstation 2. I saw some screen shots. There are many Dreamcast games that look better than this. I bet its boring too. I heard it took only ONE hour to beat. ONE hour. ONE HOUR!!! $50 for one hour! Are you people insane? Spending $50 for one hour of gameplay, probably with no replay value either. The show may be horrible, but I have a feeling this may be worse.\n",
      "This is just a flat out horrible game.  When I first heard American Idol would be making its debut as a video game, I immediately knew it would be a horrible idea, and it was.  Bad bad bad.The fact that the game puts too much thought and effort into selecting a hairstyle and dressing up your teenage Idol character just makes the game stink even more.  As for the actual singing part, well, pressing buttons on the controller JUST the right way will help you stay in tune with the musical notes you hear.  This isn't any fun, though.  Avoid.\n",
      "If you have a four year old that has, for some reason, an affinity for prefab pop music, then this might be the game for you.  For the rest of us, this is a waste of money and time.  Wow, you get to choose the costumes and the hairstyles!  That is hardly what I call gameplay.  As for the gameplay itself --- if you know the difference between a triangle, circle, etc. then you are 90% percent of the way there.  Again, your preschool tots might find this a little daunting, but they will be the only ones.  One reviewer compared this to the old game SIMON, but that game emphasized good memory skills above everything else and is in fact still more challenging than this pre-fab nonsense.  Save your money and your time & avoid this boring, unchallenging garbage.\n",
      "The Grinch is back in full force and it looks like Konami has tried to capture his essence in this poorly made game. Konami has made some dynamite games (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Metal Gear Solid to name a few), so it comes as a shock that they've let this thing slip out the door. It's sad that many unsuspecting and well-intentioned parents will pick this one up thinking that their child will enjoy it. This game is horrible, pure and simple. Every level consists of the same challenges so boredom sets in fast. The graphics go from awful to horrendous, and back to awful if you're lucky. The pop-up is here and it's in charge. For instance, in the first level I played, the Grinch was on a ledge that completely disappeared when I moved him slightly. And on many occasions, the insides of buildings would stick out through the roofs and walls, making for a very unattractive gaming experience. I hope I've made it clear that the Grinch is a gift no man, woman or child, should receive.\n",
      "I played this game last Xmas, and within about 10 minutes I wanted to put it back in the box and throw it up the chimney.  Maybe I was just missing something, or maybe this game is absolutely horrible.  Someone else on here said they couldn't figure out the 1st world; I'm with you...I don't get this game.\n",
      "This game is soooo fun, but sooooo many bugs.  You think thats nothing?  Trust me, what a pain in the bum.  Glitches, stalls, ugh.  I have two copies for playstation and both have the same problems.  YET, if you buy it knowing and expecting bugs, or if it's ever re-released without them, this could be your favorite game ever.  Puzzle action without being lame...so grinchy.\n",
      "This game is tedious and boring. You use the same dumb tricks to beat different characters in lame looking arenas.Avoid Ready 2 Rumble 2. I love sport games but this just sucked.Why do I have to give it a star....c'mon Amazon put a minus feature in place for game like this\n",
      "IM sorry to say I have to give a bad rating because the game just would not play as if it were blank the company would do well to check the games before they sell them if I didnt test or check things before I work on my clients I would lose clients. Also I threw away the bag thinking there was no need for it so I couldn't return it and my kid was really upset. PLEASE test you Games before Selling Sheesh!\n",
      "As an adult I find this game extremely boring.  Basically you are a little dragon and hop around to recover dragon eggs stolen by some evil beings.  Your primary weapons are your body and the fire coming out of your mouth.  The graphics is very simple (ok, maybe because I have a PS2 I keep forgetting this game was designed for PSX), and the controls (like most Sony games) are more complicated than necessary.  The gameplay is repetitive and very tedious.  And the characters, when they talk to you, talk in text, not voice.  Very lame.If you want to play this game, rent it, don't waste your money buying it.  It's pretty easy to finish all the levels in a day or two.\n",
      "What have they done to you D!?  This game had so much potential.  Good graphics, great story, and a huge fan base.  But they made the game slow, excessively difficult, and bland.  I tried, I actually TRIED to like this game, but it was so hard to feign interest in it for more than an hour.  I loved the movies, but this is a travesty!Go Buy the Legacy of Kain series instead\n",
      "Personally, I feel ripped off for having wasted money on this product.  Like Call to Power 1, the game has some interesting features, particularly the variety of stealth units.  However, the game suffers from a number of MAJOR PROBLEMS.  Not only does it appear that the designers never playtested this game, it's clear that they never went back and played the first Call to Power either; many glaring problems from the original are still here.  The worst problems:1.  WAY TOO MANY BUGS:  The game crashes often.  Also, there's a problem with save game files being corrupted that gets progressively worse as the game progresses.  -- I finally gave up after a game that I had spent 25 hours on would not reload, even though I had EIGHT seperate save game files from the last EIGHT turns.  Every single one of them was corrupted.There are also numerous less catastrophic, but more consistent flaws in the programming. For example, stealth units are supposed to be clandestined.  When you are attacked by one, you don't know who sent it.  The computer players, however, always do, and immediately declare war in response to any stealth attack by you.2. BADLY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION:  Quite frankly, this is the worst rulebook I have ever seen.  It's long winded and repetitive, yet still lacks many key pieces of information.  As a result, you have to use trial and error to figure out how much of the game works.  One example:  the rules mention that you must have military units on hand to control your slaves, but never spells out how many.  The right ratio turns out to be 1:3, but you wouldn't know that unless your read the rules to Call to Power #1.3. WHOLE PARTS OF THE GAME DESIGN JUST DON'T WORK:  While the stealth units are interesting, some of them are so badly designed that they just don't work.  The Cleric, for example, is the chief weapon of the Theocracy, which uses it to go out and convert enemy cities to your faith.  This is an expensive and risky operation.  However, it is so ridiculously easy to undo this conversion (station a military unit in the city, endure one turn of mildly elevated unhapiness among the citizens) that no player (computer or human) ever allows a city to remain converted for more than one turn.  So why bother having the cleric unit in the game in the first place?  There are similar extreme problems with other parts of the game, many of them left over from Call to Power 1.  Do these people ever playtest their own products?4. CLUNKY INTERFACE:  The interface is badly designed.  Information that could easily be put on one screen gets spread out over two or three.  For example, information on trade routes that you currently have and those that are still available are placed on different screens.  So to compare them and figure out if you have the optimal set of routes requires endlessly flipping back and forth between two screens.Overall, I just don't see how the designers could have played this game and still released it in the pathetic state that they did.  This is the second game that I've bought from Activision which was released in an unplayable condition.  Personally, I'm swearing off their products in the future.Those interested in a good Civilization type game should probably try Civilization 2, or better still, Alpha Centauri.\n",
      "This game is too hard to conquer, because when you try to solve the puzzles with your quick wits, the opponent will keep attacking you, over and over.  It makes me both angry and sick, because you have no choice but to keep on dying!  If you want to play puzzle games, I recommend Arkanoid, Buster Bros. and Jack Brothers.  This game is not worth playing!\n",
      "I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just never impressed with the Street Fighter series when it becomes a 3D game. The graphics look terrible. It looks like a 3 year old drew up stick figures and smeered poo on them and said, &quot;look Mommy, it's Blanca!&quot;Really please, you can't tell me that you're impressed with the same predictable and boring fights with this game? Honestly, Street Fighter was a game that should have never gone 3D because it just doesn't work for the game because even so, you don't even have that because all you do is go back and forth. You can't get stuck in a corner but you also can't side step like Tekken.If PS2 really wanted to impress people, releasing Street Fighter Alpha 3 would have been the smarter move. I have to say, I'm really hoping that another one of these is not in the making.\n",
      "Wheres the 3D motions? Wheres the excitement? Wheres my refund?I bought it, I played it and then I stuck it in a time capsul and buried in my backyard. Hopefully Tekken 4 will have some, I don't know,uhm entertaining qualities you deserve from a PS2 game!\n",
      "Stay away from this game it is terrible. I liked NFL BLITZ a lot and thought that this may be a bit simmular. There are a lot of differences but the main one is that NFL BLITZ is good. With terrible sound play control and too little characters this game bites the big one. Do not even rent it.\n",
      "Good:You get a free case for the CD?Bad.No jump button.Linear game play (You use a button to access doors and stairs, what is this 1985?)Clunky controls. Its like driving an RC car where you have to mentally reverse your thinking when the car is coming toward you versus going away. This is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayable.Did I mention no jump button?I paid $5 and would have had more fun had I kept the money and A) made a paper airplane with it or B) set it on fire and watched the delightful glow.Buy Devil May Cry 3 and have a blast. Avoid this one\n",
      "The game arrived in a timely manner.  Ripped open the package put it in and loaded it up.  Looked great at first glance, don't recall the intro specifically.  The game play started and the directional buttons are used to control the mighty warlord.  The joystick has been used with nearly every game I've played in the last ten years or more.  In fact prior to home arcades all of the games used joysticks.  This feature flaw was enough for me to turn off the game and not even bother.  If you can get over that and play and enjoy it I say have at it!  I know it's been done.\n",
      "Heads up...this is one of the best games I've played, but I've never finished a session (or three slopes in a row for that matter) without the game crashing. I own ten other PS2 titles, this is the only one that has issues, so I know it isn't the console.If you can run it without porblems, it's the greatest game out there.Sorry for the bad news, folks.\n",
      "First let me explain that I have never played this game. Now with that said, let me say that this game is probably terrible. The only person who will play this game is Brian B because he eats and sleeps soccer. He is THE soccer enthusiast. He refuses to buy or rent any other ps2 games, showing severe disregard for his friends' at work professional advice. He also is a huge rem and live fan. God forbid.\n",
      "essentially, konami needed some loot for christmastime: their solution, releasing this and gradius.The graphics in this are a must see. They are creepy. The players look like showroom dummies animated to exact their revenge on the olympics.The gameplay is the opposite of confusing. I don't really understand how &quot;press buttons fast&quot; can be confusing, especially since they pummel how to play into your head before each event.I rented it, and took it back after 5 hours and got a different game because i had gotten gold in each event the 2nd time trying.Maybe konami had a deal with sony to invent a game that would only break your controllers...\n",
      "Trying as hard as it can this game lurches, lunges and sprints to a finish with a gold medal in crappyness.This &quot;Olympics&quot; simulation offers people the chance to compete in some true tests of player patience.At it's core this game is nothing more than Hyper Olympics.  Why they chose to dump this game on the PS2 is beyond me.  The game play is puzzling at best.  Logic has no place in this game and it makes that ... clear early on.I made the grave error of inviting some friends over to play.  We would relive our days in the arcade playing Hyper Olympics.  Needless to say all we did was boggle at how such a game could have been made.I can not go into how the controls worked because I am STILL not sure!  The on screen explanations are sad and are nothing more than clues tossed to the players. It's pretty clear that part of the challenge of this game is how to actually play it.Exasperation sets in very early.  In record time in fact as this game has THE worse music my poor ears have ever come across.  I am sure we would all agree that the sprit of the Olympics is best summed up in some very bad heavy rock music. Right??If you own a Sega and would like to point at a PS2 and say &quot;The PS2 [stinks]!&quot; this is the game to have running on it when you point.\n",
      "What a great concept they had. And what a shoddy pile of junk the resultant game turned out to be. Evil Dead: Hail to the King held my attention for precisely 10 minutes before the novelty wore off and I was left with nothing except a great sadness, knowing I had spent my hard-earned cash on one of the worst games ever to grace the Playstation.The game gets an F on all fronts. Its main drawing card was that it got Bruce Campbell involved to do voice work and help with concept, but the fact is, there isn't nearly enough variety in the wisecracks, comic situations and Ash's activities. There's nothing here that hasn't been done infinitely better in the Evil Dead movies. The computerized graphical representations of the Evil Dead characters are just pathetic (check out that pale graphic imitation of the title sequence of Army of Darkness). And though Bruce Campbell is still one of the most delightfully hammy comic presences out there, after about an hour of hearing him repeat the same half-dozen one-liners every half minute, you're bound to get bored.This would be okay if the game had been well designed in terms of action, aesthetics, and feel. Noooo. As with so many other games with a strong license/franchise behind it, Evil Dead: Hail to the King abuses this license, using it to attempt to cover up atrocious design. First, the control scheme. It's bad enough that this game features the single worst use of \"camera angles\" I've ever seen (move over, Fighting Force 2), but why, oh why would they force a first-person-view control scheme onto a third-person-perspective game? Imagine having to play Double Dragon using the controls for Medal of Honor, and you get the ludicrous nature of Evil Dead's controls. And oh yes, the camera angles -- what makes the designers think it's a good idea to fix the camera on top of a tree looking down on Ash when you're trying to fight the undead? And even while fighting, if you move past the edge of the screen, the action stops so that the game can load a new, closer \"angle\", which completely kills the flow of the action. Then again, there isn't much in the action anyway -- swing your chainsaw and hope for a hit, twist and turn and mash those buttons. And there are so many enemies, all of whom react in pretty much the same way, that it becomes excessive monotony before long. The fact that the enemies \"respawn\" simply adds to the boredom. The only plus? Some of the environments look tolerably like the movie. If only you weren't forced to look from those weird eyesores they call \"camera angles\". This is the worst case of game programmers trying to be filmmakers I've seen yet.All this adds up to an experience akin to waiting in a doctor's office for your turn with no magazines and the heat turned up to the max. I don't care when I kill an enemy, I don't care when I find a page out of the Necronomicon, and I don't care when I get slaughtered. The apathy this game gives me is even worse than an ultra-tough game that hangs me out to dry. Stick with the movies; one minute of Evil Dead 2 contains more action, fun and engagement than an hour spent with this sewer rat of a game.\n",
      "The only good things I can say about this game is the graphics are good and bruce campbell's voice acting is good but the gameplay sucks and the game is not fun at all when your chainsaw runs out of fuel in the game and the chainsaw is your most useful weapon in the whole entire game because your shotgun handgun and rifle are all pretty much useless the left handed weapons in Evil Dead A Fistful Of Boomstick like your 3 shotguns and your gatling guns you have and your laucher you have in that game are so much better and so much more useful than the 3 left handed weapons you have in Evil Dead Hail To The King this game sucks ass.\n",
      "I love the films, I think the game set up is great, familular and fun. I think the graphics are okay by PS standards, but...The Control is AWFUL!!!The came is set up like a keyboard game for PC, up, back and... spin??? Yes, left and right spin the Ash!!! You have to spin him, then press up for forward, spin, press up, spin, press up.Walking left...? SPIN, PRESS UP!!!Walking right...? SPIN, PRESS UP!!!Want to fight???Too bad, your behind a tree, a wall, a rock and can't see your self to... are you ready??? Spin, then press up...Did they play it before they released it? I can't believe they did.Love the movies, hate the game.Buy Fistful of Boomstick! Still too hard a game, but it plays correctly and that matters alot.Now, if they would just make a real game they might learn there's a real market out there.\n",
      "I really enjoyed every evil dead movie growing up. They scared me at times when my parents would watch em, but as I grew older not so much. I own all the movies so when I saw that I had missed this for dreamcast i picked it up for 10 dollars or so. Wow... Did anyone even test this? Did I get a bootlegged fake copy (I know I didnt)? This is horrible. I tried to like this game... really I did! Nothing Flows...Horrible Camera + Dreaded Graphics x Unforgivable controls - any fun what so ever = Evil Dead Hail to the KingI'm serious guys... this is bad. I'm talking Like Crack bad. Your filled with excitement you got it for only ten bucks or so but when you get it started 10 minutes later you just feel horrible...\n",

      "Unless you are a real snowboarder (which I am not) and into watching ESPN Winter X-Games 24-7 you will prob. think this game really sucks...for the money buy SSX Tricky, and thank me later....\n",
      "This is simply a joke, christmas fodder. If you enjoy playing this over other ps2 games you must not like utilizing the full capability of your expensive system.Truth of the matter is: konami needed to make up the costs of the developers kit, so it releases a few lame games which will be rented and bought just out of sheer lack of launch titles.The only way this game could have been valid would be if there was a gradius 5 in it as well that is actually GOOD and utilizing that emotion engine.The only emotion evoked by renting this game was pure sorrow. I guess this is what I get for utilizing an emulator to play these games a few years ago.\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that back in the day of the Super Nintendo, I did own Gradius 3 and had an absolute blast with it. The game's graphics, music and gameplay were standout gorgeous, I loved it. Granted, I have never played Gradius 4 but figured it would be just as good if not better than the G3 that I remember from back in the day. The versions on this PS2 console are an embarrassment to the PS2's capability. Granted, even though this game was released somewhat early in the PS2's era, I simply can't believe that a system that can play games like Resident Evil 4 and God of War I and II could put out something this hacked.Now, before I say anything let me just say that the G3 on this disc is NOT THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION! So if you are like me and wanted to play that game again, you can forget it. Dont pay any attention to all these ridiculous positice 5-star reviews on this site. I have no idea what kind of drugs these other gamers are on or  they probably work for Konami directly.This is SUPPOSED to be a straight arcade port, but I can't imagine the arcade version looking and playing this terribly... and I was right! I went as far as to check Youtube videos of both the SNES and arcade versions and they BOTH look significantly better than this game. So judging from that, this game isn't even a straight arcade port of G3... so what version is this exactly??? I have no idea. Seems like some extremely poor rushed port of the arcade version that plays more like an emulated game with extremely pixaleted graphics that look as if they belong on the original NES. Things are just too uneven, the objects are too big and the ships and enemies have probably like 2 or 3 colors at most. Overall, it looks terrible. I was shocked because after the really cheap looking presentation I was afraid that my worst fear was true, that this was not the SNES version. For that game, it seems that Konami made it a point to overhaul the gameplay and graphics when bringing the original arcade version home to make it more \"home friendly\", and they did an absolutely excellent job of doing so. G3 for the SNES game looked and played about 3X better than the original arcade version. I'm not sure why Konami, being the same company that brought the SNES version knowing FULL WELL it was superior to the arcade, decided instead bring the more substandard arcade version to the PS2 instead of their SNES classic. Not to also mention that the PS2 has about 3 or 4 times the graphical horsepower that the SNES had! It's like, are you kidding me??? Again, it was a rush job and an absolute embarrassment to them. Shame on Konami for not having the common sense to AT THE VERY LEAST just port the SNES version over. If you ask me, this should've been an overhauled and updated version of the SNES version! Who even cares about the arcade version of G3??? I wish I can say some redeeming things about the game, but if the game isn't even ARCADE perfect, what's the point? This is just an humiliating rush job that was just put out to meet demand. Even the voice acting prompts in the game that state what power up you use sound severely weak. Konami decided to forgo the cheesy sounding \"kill/destroy them all!\" and \"You need more practice\" bits out of the SNES versions, and on here they just sound annoying and stupid and completely unfitting to the game's atmosphere.Now considering Gradius 4, there isn't much difference. The G4 version on this disc does look and play a BIT better than the G3 version. But from my memory G4 wasn't brought home on any console, so we really only have the arcade version to go by. Whether this is an ACTUAL arcade port of the game I'm not really sure because I didn't bother researching G4 on Youtube or anywhere else to make a comparison. Granted, even so, the game does move a BIT faster and gameplay is a bit smoother and there isn't that disgusting pixelated look to the game, but overall G4 is just a small step better than G3. I feel no real desire to return to either game, and would much rather just buy a used copy of G3 for the SNES instead. To add insult to injury, the games don't even have a continue feature with them. Nope, you basically have to beat these games in a single sitting with your measly 3 lives (and 5 if you change it on the options menu), and considering how badly these games play, don't even bother putting it on anything harder than \"Very Easy\" mode. You won't get anywhere.Save your money, and if you're a Gradius fan, I would suggest either getting an NES to play the original, an SNES for G3 and for your PS2 go out and spend the extra for Gradius 5 which is a completely new version of Gradius that actually decides to USE the PS2's graphical power. But avoid this rush job at all costs!\n",
      "This was one game that I remotely enjoyed in the arcade, but unfortunately what made the game worth its while was the gun. The gun was the whole attraction of the game, which was otherwise just a dull shoot-em-up.But my question is why? Why repackage a game that was clearly marked for the Arcades with the extra guns and what-not. Yes, Playstation has had some success in repackaging some of the arcade games for play at home, and yes thay have made great games with shooter attributes without the gun, but if they were to re-package a shooter game where people have gotten used to using a gun in the arcade for Playstation-2, they should (and could) have gave us some sort of a gun for just a few dollars extra and at least made it worth its while.\n",
      "This game ....  When I buy a game I want to be able to play it over and over.  But with this game if you play it once you know all there is about it.

      "Silent Scope cannot be played using a control pad.  The \"scope\" moves so slowly, and it is rather frustrating to look for enemies while being shot sixty million times because it takes twelve years to move the gun scope around to find targets.  A good PS2 zapper, if included, would make this game 4 or even 5 stars.  The graphics are crisp and clear, the sound is good, but none of that matters when your game is over in ten seconds because you can't look around fast enough.\n",
      "Bought it because it sounded really interesting.  Never got it to run on my computer.  Continuoslly locked up my system.  Actually threw away the disc.  Didn't feel it was worth wrecking my computer for.\n",
      "I just picked up Mafia -- more than 7 years after its release -- mostly because of the positive ratings (more on this later). If you can get past the fact that the graphics are dated (although remarkable considering the limitations they worked with) and learn about the game in terms of gameplay alone, read on.First the basics: Mafia tells the story of Thomas Angelo as he joins the ranks of the Salieri 'famiglia' and gains power within their ranks. The story -- which seems to be one of the selling points of the game -- is delivered through twenty multi-staged missions and in-engine cutscenes. The many interactive challenges in each mission are delivered through two distinct gameplay modes: driving and third-person exploration/combat.The third-person mode is the most versatile. From menial work to secret dealings to baseball bat beatings to all-out tommy-gun massacres, this is where the most action will come from. These segments can be pretty challenging: the AI doesn't waste its chances. If you CAN get shot, you WILL get shot; you, in the other hand, will leave lots of bullets in door thresholds as the game misrepresents your line of sight. It's probably too preoccupied with cooking threats -- be it a couple of shotgun-toting goons out of nowhere or a well-placed shooter -- to bother with those pesky details, such as saving your progress. You'll find yourself going back to square one quite time a few times as the game just decides that it's not handing you any more ammo or health refills, and tough luck, here comes yet another trigger-happy batch, freshly teleported from Screwjoo.Every failure (and there will plenty of them) will set you back from twenty minutes to an hour of 'gameplay', and it won't spare you any of the mind-numbing chores that saturate the 'experience'. You will have to go drive all the way there again, talk to guy A and guy B again, search for and fetch C for them (most of the time without knowing precisely what you're looking for or where to begin), and even load boxes into trucks and wipe out puke from a backed out toilet... and it's just as fun as it sounds.Not all of the game is made of tight spots and grunt work, though. You will be doing plenty of driving too: some missions involve vintage car chases (which at 30 mph somehow fail to be the adrenaline pumpers you'd expect), and the miniature city of Lost Haven is big and labyrinthine enough that most of your time will be spent traveling between points A and B. Going any significant distance in these roads (which apparently were designed by M.C. Escher) means a lot going around blocks and finding the entrance points of bridges and tunnels. You can try to cut corners, but policemen and cop cars will show up when least expected to punish you for running that red light or speeding. Lastly, there's also a little circuit racing; here, your main task will be not to engineer those sharp turns in a way that will keep you car from spinning like a top, which is harder than it sounds as the car seems to like it.That about sums it up. Oh, I forget: Mafia has been compared to the GTA titles, but in truth the resemblance is very superficial. It should be likened to the Sims -- Sure, you can roam about and steal another car and victimize random citizens, but it doesn't reward wanton violence the way GTA did. No powerups, no better guns or cars, no cool stuff to be stolen... fuggedaboutit.Veredict: Avoid like the plague. Unless you're a masochist.What should have been a three-hour game was padded into a much larger but radically duller and more frustrating experience. What little genuine fun remained was irrecoverably marred by obtuse, artificial difficulty (stiff controls, the savepoint system) and brain-dead chores.Whether the team ran out of ideas five seconds after development began or they just hate gamers, I don't know. I theorize that the positive reviews given to this game either a) come from a time where much less was expected from games and b) nobody dares tell the emperor that he's naked. Look elsewhere for a genuine vintage thrill; I've heard Max Payne also comes pretty cheap these days.\n",
      "A note to game developers everywhere.  It's possible to create a challenging game that does not involve intensely annoying obstacles.  Rule #1:  all games should have a quick save option at any point in the game.  No one enjoys going over the same mission over and over to get it right.  Mafia only saves at the end of a mission or important task--or not nearly enough!  This alone makes me want to pitch the whole mess.  Rule #2:  excessive amounts of driving around and map reading with old jalopy cars with extremely poor handling and dealing with other stupid drivers on the road is no fun attall!  Way too much driving required.  I drive enough to and from work 5x a week and deal with inconsiderate idiots on the road daily.  I don't need it in a game I want to be a diversion from the grind of daily life.If there were workable cheats available for this game it might be bearable.  I would like to finish it, but only with access to cheats that actually work.  I play games for enjoyment, not torture.  I've searched the internet several times for cheats, and none of them work as described.  A real disappointing game that didn't have to be.\n",

      "I've got a brand new Nvidia 5200 128 MB graphics card, and just got back into computer gaming, so I was eager to try this game because it's a genre I love. Plus, my PC played COD and Battlefield 1942 so there shouldn't have been technical problems to play it. Boy was I wrong to think that.This game is a technical disaster. I ran it on a P4 with 256 MB RAM and it still crashed on me three times, something that never happened even once with other games at all.After it crashed for the third time BEFORE I even got to start the first mission, I gave up.The developers really dropped the ball on this game. From its looks and screen shots I've seen, it looks like a great game. But if it's too unstable to play, nobody's going to notice it.This game is an absolute disaster from a technical standpoint and the developers should be ashamed of themselves.\n",
      "First, there are similar games with better grahpics, like Myst.  Second, upon playing the game I felt a bit betrayed.  Nothing on the packaging indicates that this game has a specifically Christian outlook, but it becomes apparent upon play.  Had I know, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.  Now that I have I suppose I'll have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something.  The designers, et al, should have had the integrity to be honest about the slant of the game BEFORE unsuspecting people buy it and discover it for themselves.  I've nothing against proselytization, but at least be up front about it so that I don't waste my time or money.\n",

I tried everything possible to get it to work and nothing, no picture showed up or sound when turned to the right channel mode and the cables matching where it should go. The black cable also has a small cut in the black cable but it didn't go all the way through. I will be returning this once i get paid and buying something else.

      "I feel I should post how much I hated this piece of junk here, since the other reviews seem to give the impression that it's a fantastic game and everybody will love it. I couldn't stand it and took it back a couple of days later. All the positive reviews below positively puzzle me, since engaged in a conversation about this game in the local EB, everybody else declared they had hated it too. So who's writing those reviews?The thing is too slow! It takes about 50 years to build a school. And the economics of the game don't make sense either -- you charge nothing for rent and pay everybody beaucoup bucks, and still everybody moves off your island and the birth rate decreases.Also, this game is not as funny as the programmers obviously believe. I agree with the reviewer below who said that the manual is much funnier than the actual game.Lastly, the graphics of the game are overcomplex, meaning that the game will be extremely fussy on most setups. This wouldn't be such a problem, but Tropico either has no tech support line, or they don't answer what they say is the support line, or they've done a fantastic job with hiding the contact information of the real tech support line. In other words, after a couple of days of trying, I couldn't get any help.\n",
      "This game is ridiculous- I couldn't even finsish it.  In fact, I barely started it.  It's obviously just a ripoff of all the Blair Witch hype from a few years ago- a movie I love.  Disappointing.\n",
      "As a fan of the movie, I had high hopes for this game, but they didn't pan out.  Not quite a true port - \"Rustin Parr\" is more of a cross-over between the BWP franchise and \"Nocturne\".In the game, you play Elspeth \"Doc\" Holliday, a sort of gun-wielding investigator for a super-secret government organization of the 1940's - one introduced in \"Nocturne\".  With its own simulator room, the agency trains agents like Holliday to take on missions involving the supernatural (what we now call \"paranormal\") phenomenon.  Inevitably, Holliday's superiors have become drawn to the case of \"Rustin Parr\", a recluse who killed a group of children near his hometown of Burkittsville (formerly \"Blair\"), Maryland in a psychotic rage in 1941.  Parr vaguely attributed his crimes to prodding by the legendary Elly Kedward (aka \"The Blair Witch\").  (Parr's story was told in the movie, and it's apparently his creepy house in which the final, cryptic scenes of the film play out.)  The premise of the game sort of clashes with the original's movie's selling point - which was to keep us wondering about whether these supernatural elements were genuine no atter how obvious it was they were.I gotta confess that I couldn't get past the start-up level.  The game ran smoothly, as far as hardware is concerned, on my old Pentium 4 (at this stage, hardware specs are your least worry), but gameplay itself was a major hassle.  Using the \"Nocturne\" game engine, you maneuver Holliday in 3rd person.  Only, unlike other \"shooters\" - 3rd or 1st person, game perspective isn't fixed to the character, but to a room - set pieces through which your character enters & exits.  This allows for nice looking scenes (since your PC doesn't have re-render the backgrounds to compensate for movement) but extremely static ones.  It also makes it harder to confront threats and position yourself for such esoteric acts as opening doors or picking up objects.  This made for extremely frustrating gameplay from the very first level.  I got fed up just trying to navigate the simulator room, and decided to make the game vanish from my HD.  Recently, I thought I'd give the game a second chance, yet all I've found is the CD sleeve...\n",
      "Everyone likes saving money, and this controller is cheaper by far, but it's not worth it.  Aside from the occasionally working buttons and tricky directional-pad, the worst crime comes from the rumble feature.  If you're playing a game that uses the rumble feature a lot, you're going to discover that [inferior] plastic shaking in your hands not only feels wrong, but it sounds wrong, too.  I had people from way across the room comment on the loud noises coming from the vibrations of this plastic wonder.  Do yourself a favor and just buy the real thing instead of this one.\n",
      "WHEN U BUY THIS CONTROLLER YOU ONLY BUY IT TO SAVE 5 BUCKS. YOU WONT SAVE 5 BUCKS WHEN YOU HAVE TO SPEND 120 BUCKS TO FIX UR PS2. ALSO, IT VOIDS UR WARRENTY. TO ME, IT DIDNT RUIN MY PS2 COMPLETELY, IT JUST BURNED OUT THE CONTROLLER PORT. SO I USE THE SECOND CONTROLLER PORT WITH A MULTI TAP (WHICH DOESNT ALWAYS WORK) I FINALYL DECIDED TO SEND THE PS2 FOR FIXING. AND IT WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN 120 BUCKS CAUSE IT WAS ONLY A CONTROLLER PORT.SO PRETTY MUCH, INSTEAD OF SAVING 5 BUCKS WHICH U CAN MAKE IN AN HOUR WORKING FOR BURGER KING, I SPEND LOTS MORE FIXING THE PS2\n",
      "Wow, let me count the ways this controller [stinks].Let's start with the fact that this waste of $$$ will VOID YOUR PS2 WARRANTY!!!  Yep, I found out the hard way.  Any (ANY!) third-party accessory you buy that is not licensed by SONY will INSTANTLY VOID YOUR PS2 WARRANTY. One month after purchasing my PS2 (which was also the time period for the return policy at the store I bought the PS2 from) I made the mistake of picking up one of these horrid controllers (it lasted two weeks before finally dying - that is, when I could play games).  Games started locking up left and right after I started using it. According to SONY tech support, the second I plugged in this uncomfortable hunk of poo, my PS2 warranty went flying out the window. So I sent the PS2 back to SONY for repair (along with this controller for testing) at the price of $119 and a month without the machine (it's hard to watch your new DVD's when your brand new DVD player is already being repaired). The PS2 came back repaired along with a new warranty and a letter from SONY stating this controller was the cause of the problem as determined by diagnostic testing.  SHWEEEEEEEEEET!!!I understand that this will not happen to every PS2 combined with this controller, BUT you WILL lose your warranty none the less. I have run across this issue on several PS2 message boards and the SONY tech support person I initially spoke with said many other PS2 owners have had this problem thanks to the Dual Impact Gamepad. Please, learn from my mistake and spend the extra cabbage on a good controller.  Or not, it's your $$$.\n",
      "Well, it was cheap. The cables are super thin. Think cheap headphone cable. The sound cables worked fine, but the video output has continual static snow that drives over the screen in waves. Other than that it works.\n",
      "I tried this stick out to compliment my old Namco arcade stick. They shou'dve spent less time with the metal, and put more of the money into developing responsive buttons and a stick that registers motion correctly. None of the extra features matter if the basic design is flawed so deeply. A controller's first and really, only purpose is to enable you to move your character around smoothly onscreen. The Shadowblade fails at this. I've used Ascii sticks, Hori sticks, Mas sticks, and the Shadowblade isn't even close though it shares a similar price range.Shop around. There are way better sticks out there. Especially if you're a fighting game fan, you're just torturing yourself if you buy this mess.\n",
      "On a whim and a touch of desperation I picked this up at a local shop, being the only stick I could find in town. I really regret doing so because it's just awful. &quot;Mush&quot; describes it well, mushy buttons, mushy stick, just mushy. This is due to the fact that everything on the stick is capable of operating in analog mode (why? this is an arcade stick for crying out loud!). Because of this, response time is greatly reduced in fighters and you've got to really throw the stick through its entire range before it will register.If you've ever used a nice stick like the ASCII FT (even the Agetech DC stick) or any of Happ's sticks in an arcade for any length of time, avoid this thing like the plague. You'll regret it as much as I do.\n",

      "My intention with this review is to provide a rather different oppinion from most reviews here which qualify this game with an average 4.5 stars.  I purchased this game for my son for two reasons:  The price drop and the excellente reviews.  I had no previous knowledge of Rayman, so I came unbiased to play it. I own 3 titles from Spyro the Dragon (games that have always satisfied my son) Jak and Daxter (PS2) and Crash Bandicoot \"Wrath of Cortex\" (Xbox), and my son plays all of them very regularly.  I personally like these games very much so I expected Rayman 2 to be a great platformer game.  Well, the thing is that my son played Rayman 2 for about an hour and a half and never picked it up again, I myself had to play it in order to understand what was wrong, but then I understood him.First: the graphics, I have read in every review, even the newer ones, that the graphics are excellent and so on.  Well, to my opinion the graphics can not even match Spyro 3 on the PSOne, they are graphics that are ok for an early launch on the PS2 but can not be compared to the possibilities that we are getting today, and I refer in this case to Jak and Daxter, where the developers (Naughty Dog) have done a beautiful job on this subject.  Second: the voice acting, what can I say, I personally found the constant whispering (instead of real voices) very annoying, I even thought there was some kind of malfunction in the CD because of this, until I realized that those whispers WERE the voices.  Third: the story, even though it is a typical platform story, there is no fun in it, I personally found it very boring, and I couldn't play it for more than half hour before I could fall asleep.I truly wish that I could find something good about this game, but the truth is that I had to sell it one day after I got it, neither my son nor I liked this game.  If you truly want to play a good platformer then go for Jak and Daxter, there is no comparison (great graphics, hilarious voice acting -even in spanish-, good story and lots of fun), or wait for the PS2 version of Spyro the dragon, or even play the PSOne versions of Spyro, I can assure you that you will have more fun with those than you will with Rayman 2.  I was deceived by the price drop and the good reviews, and made a terrible mistake: wasted [money], so don't fall for the same, this game can only and hardly diserve the one star I gave it.\n",
      "This game really isn't fun.  I'm not really sure what is supposed to BE fun about it.  You can't skip through the cut scenes and the characters that play your concience are just annoying.  Even with the trick to make immense amounts of food and wood with miracles you spend all your time trying to make the ant like people do SOMETHING.  I spent about thirty or forty hours trying to enjoy this game and then I gave up.  I had spent a rediculous amount of time trying to get through only a few parts of the game.  Your creature really isn't very interesting.  Sure it learns and everything but even teaching it is just a matter of repeating the same thing over and over and over and over again.  Not something I really enjoy in a game but hey that's just me.  A few &quot;levels&quot; into the game your creature is taken from you and you have to be a god without him for a while.  Right when I was getting a close to getting him back, I was set back another several hours by an attack I could have stopped had the symbol interface not been so slow.  I'm not sure who would enjoy this game for any amount of time.  If you like being in control I'd suggest a Sim game. Another thing I found odd was that this game came on a single CD.  For it's price and the amount of hype that I had heard I would have expected a game which consisted of a little more than poorly rendered worlds in which tasks are set up that are much more like chores than quests.In closing, if you like taking out the garbage and doing other menial tasks, there is a slim chance you could enjoy this game.\n",
      "The reviewers who went nuts over this game at the popular magazines and web sites probably felt the same way I did after completing the first of the game's &quot;worlds&quot;.After the &quot;tutorial&quot; world where you are walked through the game's premise, story, and how to get things done, I was having a lot of fun and was very excited about the game.Then it all went down the tubes.The supposed Creature AI is non-existent.  It has nothing to do with artifical intelligence, it is merely an if/then database that plays percentages.  It is frustrating and not complex.  The AI won't link consequences to actions so you punish or reward actions regardless of their consequences.The game is very unhelpful.  Since you have to spend a lot of time away from your creature doing quests, monitoring villagers, or scouting around, it would be nice if the game's messages meany anything.  However, when the message &quot;Your creature will now do that sort of thing more often&quot; comes up, it make syou want to scream.  What did the creature do?  Was it good or bad?  Is it too late to reward/punish and teach the creature (and of course it is)?  Who the heck knows?  The game doesn't tell you.When you do get around to rewarding and punishing your creature, you really have no idea if you &quot;got to him in time&quot; or if he is ridiculously associating your reward with another action.Creature Combat is ridiculously lame.  It's a glorified mouse clicking battle that doesn't really mean anything.Finally, let's say you've played a while, feel like you've gotten the hang of it, and want to start over... too bad, there's no such thing as starting over.  First off, you have to go through the tutorial, no skipping, no fast forwarding... so there goes a good hour of your time.  It doesn't really matter if you save or load your game, your &quot;creature's personality&quot; is persistent.  Basically, they were far too lazy to work in a real save/load, so instead they just hardwire your &quot;creature&quot; in, even if you &quot;get a new creature&quot;.Yes, the community has developed fan made workarounds and patches.  But this underscores the point.  The fan community has to rush in to save a game that is too restricting and too deceiving.  There is nothing going on under the hood of this &quot;game&quot;.  You don't really train anything, since a truly trained creature would not have to be retaught every hour or so, but simply rewarded properly.  And its a fact that many trained psychologists will disagree that punishments are as predictable as the game pretends to be.  But don't worry, your &quot;creature&quot; will clean out its database of &quot;training&quot; while you are away doing other things to add to your frustration.And after a while, you'll get sick of the controls to reward/punish.  You'll be clamoring for a hotkey.What is the one single innovation in this game?  Well, there IS one.  It's the &quot;scribbling&quot; method used to cast spells by drawing with the mouse.  Some people memorize hotkeys, others don't.  This is easy and intuitive, with a helpful legend in the lower right hand corner so you remember that moving the cursor in a swirl brings up the spell you want, etc.One innovation for a truly pathetic game.  This isn't worth your time, although for the first hour you will be amazed and in awe.  Then your frustration will turn to anger, and an oath to never buy another game from Peter Molyneaux (it's no joke his next venture is named Project Ego... how fitting).\n",
      "Ok I was expecting alot at first cause I went to a friends house and watched him play it for awhile, it looked like lots of fun. So I installed it on my computer, which is more than adequate for any other game, but apperently not amazing enough for this game, everything went slow and even when I adjusted the picture &quot;quality&quot; nothing changed, the quality was the same and so was the slow speed. So I dealt with it and started playing. The tutorial was sooooo long and boring I wanted to die, but I knew soon I'd have a creature and it would be neat. So I get through the tutorial and have to find my creature, which takes about 8 hours cause the controls for this game are the most horrible and difficult controls ever. I mean all they had to do was have the mouse control where you're looking and then have the keyboard arrows zoom in and out, thats all, but no, it had to be impossible instead. I cant even tell you how many times I got stuck just trying to move a few feet. Then after I got my creature I started trying to be nice to villagers, but they're all lazy and dumb, they cant do anything on their own, I killed them just for being so stupid and demanding. Then I had problems with my creature cause the bugs in the game wouldnt allow me to pick up a horse to feed it after the horse had moved out of the animals range. It was just so frustrating and bad that I immediatly uninstalled the game and returned. Its not worth anyone's time, and what seems like it would be fun is really just tedious and boring.\n",
      "This game is really boring and it has high systems requirements and video cards problems...... Do not BUY this game!\n",
      "This game admirably breaks from a lot of the god games inspired by Sim City and Civilization.  Unfortunately the game designers tried to do far too much with the way the player interfaces with the game universe, gave inadequate in game tutorials and made the manual almost entirely useless.  After many hours of gameplay I couldn't figure out how to build a sustained civilization without giving it constant attention.  I would like to say more, but I just wanted to register my frustration with this game and hopefully dissuade others from buying it.\n",
      "I have a P3 850, and this game runs slow and clumsy. The interface is overwhelmingly confusing and there just doesnt seem to be that much point to the game. Sure, killing your subjects is fun and the pet feature is nice. However, the interface/controls are simply to complex. I dont know about you, but I am going back to Civ II and SC3000. Skip Black and White..\n",
      "Don't waste your time.This is forty dollars worth of tweak, and not as much fun as a typical sim.\n",
      "Somewhere between 3 and 5 years in the making, Black &amp; White disappoints and irritates on so many different levels that it's hard to know where to start.  The non-intuitive control system takes hours of getting used to, and even then is clumsy and unresponsive.  The graphics are not on a par with such recent titles as Giants or Sacrifice, the landscape morphs and warps as you move around it and the villagers, well, the less said about them and their unfeasibly large feet the better.  The sub-plots are supposed to be humourous but are merely twee, as are the good and bad advisors.  Much has been made in the gaming press of the creature AI and it may well be the best ever in a computer game, but the game itself, which should surely be the most important part, is sadly lacking. This may well be selling swiftly, but will be returned to retail outlets just as fast by all but the most persevering of gamers.\n",
      "Well, this games sucks.It is not even a finished product. Big gaming companies should be punished for not delivering a finished product. It's a different story if a game is not good, but it's totally unacceptable if people have to pay for imcomplete product.\n",

Lion head studios is geting NO more buisness from me!!!\n",

      "This game is very original with good graphics.  The person who thought this up was very creative.  (...)  However, once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs.  Some of these are invisible creatures that won't move, creature won't eat or learn, creature won't interact with objects, missing sheep for sheep quest, etc.  So you go download patch 1.10 and install it.  Then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start.  It just freezes.  So you use the EAsy program to report the problem (...) and that program locks up your system.  Congratulations, you have just wasted (...) your hard earned money on a (...) buggy game.  (...)\n",
      "I read Osiris' review about needing the 90MB patch, that is incorrect. That is a patch for the non-English game if people still want to here and see English language. Being from Canada, I guess he would need that. Sorry Osiris, but game companies expect that if you live in Canada and buy the game there, you will PROBABLY speak the local language, not the game's natural English. I admit that that is a huge patch, especially if you own a modem, but at least it was made available to you. I have yet to play the game, which is why I didn't rate it high. However, I ordered it a few days ago, and should get to play it around January. I will write another review about it then. I am fairly sure I will give it a high rating then.\n",
      "This game is truly awful.  The game has an interesting concept but the realization it horrible.  You're a God but the only way for you to do anything is with your free floating hand - which is close to impossible to control.  Between that, the poor graphics, and the problems it caused with my system I gave up after a couple days.  I wouldn't bother unless you're into frustration.\n",

      "I was not impressed with this game.  I found that when you hit the key board to move, it was too quick.  I would press it once or twice and it would just spin around.  Overall, I did not like this game and suggest that you look for something else.\n",
      "This game is booooooorrrring. My goodness is this game boring. If you're not asleep now, you will be once you've played this thing. I actually think that the talking &quot;Billy Bass&quot; (you know, the one in the commercials that sings) is a whole lot more entertaining than this.\n",

Bad physics int he sense of hitting others and aceloration and everything. With the bad control I find it quite hard to get anywhere int he game as well as the sight of the game screen just mkes me want to shut it off. Sorry I don't mean to be so rude to the game but I really am disapointed and would not recommend it if you like racing games at all.\n",

      "Everyone loves this game yet everyone seems to hate it for all the same reasons and it's a shame really.  Crimson Skies was like a soon to be star standing in the wings waiting for it's big break but when it hit the stage and stood in the lime light, it choked and fell flat on it's face in the worst possible way.  What a disappointment it was to load Crimson Skies and have my jaw instantly hit the keyboard for all it's quirky and wonderful audio/visual treats, the voices, the music, the design, the brilliant colors and the trees (my God the trees!), only to have my guts turn while I listened to the hard drive in  my Compaq PII 450 mhz system grind and groan and crackle for what seemed endless minutes as it struggled with a simple drop down menu.  And lets not even get into the nearly three minutes it took to just exit the game.  Oh, I have the onboard tools to run it, ATI Rage Fury Pro 32mb board and 128 sdram but it seems it doesn't matter what your running, a  350, 750 or even 1000 mhz system, you'll simply end up spending much more time waiting to exit menu screens or load levels then you'll ever spend playing the game.  And even after an exhausting hour on the phone with our patient friends at Microsoft Tech Support, tinkering and tweaking my system, I gained very little satisfaction, although the frustration grew with the fact that this absolutely brilliant concept, wrapped up in probably one of the best designed packages ever to hit store shelves was so horribly flawed that it squeezes the very life out of what could of have been one of the best games of the year if not ever.  If  I were to rate this game on sheer fun, excitement and originality, there's no question it earns a solid five stars, but the endless waiting for those brief brilliant moments when I actually got to scream through amazingly detailed  billowing clouds and over Crimson Skies' breathtaking landscapes made me just walk away, shaking my head, muttering to myselfwith great disappointment, \"so close and yet so very far\".  Maybe someday they'll find the silver bullet patch that will redeem this worthy title, if not, it runs the very real risk of going down in software history as the Heaven's Gate of  PC gaming.  Here's to hopping that doesn't happen.\n",
      "I have had two Logotech sticks: the first, Logitech's Wingman 3D. It lasted a year and a half, but toward the end lost center and never recovered. My second, this one, lasted for 3 months. Then the twist started to go leaving me guessing where neutral on my rudder was (every time). I have read of others who have had similar centering issues: it is a good product out of the box, but the quality of components inside the base are not what I expect.I ended up replacing it with a Saitek Evo Cyborg Force- it may cost a little more, but it is much more adjustable, and the feel is more substantial to me.I won't be buying Logitech again from my experience. Some others may have had better luck- but from the centering issue, well that's pretty basic in any flight sim.\n",
      "First off let me start off by saying check reviews for this game on game spot you will see a rating of 6.2 out of 10 by 177 votes, there is 18 votes on amazon and somehow it is rated 8.5 out of 10. This is a game that is basically only playable if your a child who wants to play a shooter game that isn't quite as violent, challenging or story driven. Not the worse game in existence, but this definitely a middle of the pack title 3 or 5 stars is generous in my opinion.\n",
      "Encouraged by the rave reviews, I bought this game but ended up tossing it into the garbage after 6 hours of play. Aside from the horrible 1996 graphics, there is dead boring game play on a buggy interface.You spend hours building cities that lack character and armies symbolized by one awful figure. Dragging your people around the map is a real challenge because you can only move them a tiny bit each turn, while getting them onto ships is even more frustrating due to the awkward tile design that governs movements on the map. Historical value is 0, as ancient Egyptians build cities named Melbourne and Helsinki and the American Empire begins with Abe Lincoln in 600 B.C.Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Age of Kings or even better, Combat Mission--if you like WWII themes--and you won't be disappointed. They do cost more, but you get what you paid for.\n",
      "Despite almost universal praise in the games press, this is a terrible, terrible game. I'm horrified that it seems to have gathered so many good reviews. It's essentially a dated, semi-professional Quake 2 mod, with the addition of a novel damage-modelling system that lets you shoot people's arms off. Made even worse by a useless attempt to give the game some authenticity - the box, CD, installation and loading screen are covered with warnings that the game is a realistic depiction of modern warfare, all of which exist purely as a tease, because the game itself is essentially a G.I. Joe cartoon with blood. The violence is strictly cartoonish - shoot somebody in the leg, and he hops around yowling - and the novelty wears off after a minute or so. Everything else about the game fails, comically so, from the interactive music (which, because of the game's lack of any slow bits, stays in 'combat mode' almost all the time, negating the point), to the 'stealth element' (make too much noise and bad guys appear in the level, usually in totally illogical places) to the interface, which looks as if it had been drawn by a backwards child. The gameplay itself is pure Quake 2 - you run through a linear track, along which bad guys are placed at regular intervals. Sometimes you have to press a button to open a door. If something moves, you shoot it. Most usually, nothing moves - the bad guys are, in the words of GameSpot, 'strawberry-jam-filled turrets'. Anyway, if you want a decent modern shoot-em-up with stealth elements, get 'Project IGI'. If you want violence, trip somebody up and then jump on them and have a fight.\n",
      "It has been awhile since I played this, I have the PS2 version and I I bet you could get a used copy for about 99 cents. This is probably the most violent game I have ever played. There is a violence lock in the game that can let you control whether dismembered limbs or blood are allowed. If you turn everything on, you have one big goreapalooza. This game goes beyond mature. Dont let the kids get there hands on this!\n",

      "I thought madden 2001 will have a lot of difference with madden 2000 just like what fifa did, but the game was not even better a single bit! The linesmen in the game still aren't 3d modeled but still are 2d modeled! The graphics may be a bit better but has made the game very slow! Then i thought about the new players in miami dolphins. At madden 2000, dan marino was concederd still playing in real life but was not! And i saw that in madden 2001, Dan marino is still concedered as a player at the dolphins. The whole setup was bad. Madden also put in european football teams which i think is gossip. If those teams they put were real, i'd bet that the players aren't real players at all!\n",
      "I am not what one might call an overly hyped video game player. I dont go out and buy the next installment of FF (after VIII, it really got bad imo), I enjoyed .hack and its storyline though (but I felt that the series could have been brought together into one large game like with FFVII). Then there is the PE video game, I loved the first one, had some trouble, but over all it was a great game. I knew there was a part 2, so I found a copy and started playing it. Boy...was I disappointed.First, the game play is terrible, the movement is haphazard, the angles are horrific, and its down right troublesome (unlike the first one). I loathed the movement, there was none of the smoothness of the first one.Second, I hated the leveling, what leveling there is. You dont go up in your hit points, you barely go up in MPs and parasite powers, and even worse, when you go to a next scene (from one point to the next in the story) you go back down to your 100 hit points.Third, which is related to the angles, the combat is atrocious. There is nothing quick and exciting, in fact its down right stressful because (since you rarely have a chance to get items for health unless you spend &quot;money&quot; between the scenes at home base) you end up dying again and again until low and behold you get through with maybe 1 hit point left and then WHAM you are hit by another attack and you have to do the whole stupid thing over again. Even worse, the camera angles are so bad you rarely if ever see the enemies and just shoot blindly.Fourth, connected to three, the weapons are horrible to use. You end up getting killed repeatedly because you have to jerkingly reload so many times that when you are facing multiple opponents (unlike the smoothness of the original first story) and youre going to get killed unless you spend hours dealing with one combat situation.Fifth, items, with the original first game, you got lots and lots of items. With this game, you are in luck if after three or four attacks (bringing you down to 1 hit point) you finally strike it and get a recovery2 pill that brings you back up to original hit points but then again those hit points are taken down again by the end of the next combat round.While the story line might be interesting, it fails in comparison to the first one and by all means, the poorness of this game in the controlling just makes you so fed up that you dont care how this story ends. Its a bad, bad game that could have been a great sequel if only the company had followed the original game's beauty. Dont buy this game unless you have lots of headache medicine.I can't believe it, but I actually hate this game.\n",
      "The first PE had problems - Aya's painfully slow movement, some bad camera angles, etc. - but was overall a good game.  This ... this is a travesty.First, the movement system is *miserable*.  Character-relative movement is an abomination, painful, and results in many many deaths.  Second, Aya's Parasite powers are pathetic - how did she go from taking on Eve and the Ultimate Being to this!?  Eve would have turned this Aya into mincemeat.  Third, why is Aya suddenly young and dressing in bizarre fashion?  I dunno about you, but *I'd* wear body armor, or at least long pants, when confronted with creatures like that.In terms of plot and characterization ... there isn't any that I had the patience to see.  Aya's sole reaction on seeing a human (or apparent human) mutate boils down to so what.  This, from a woman who freaked at seeing the rat mutate, who has not seen anything else mutate since finishing off the Ultimate Being ... who seemed to think nothing else was going to mutate.Stupid puzzles, uninteresting secondary characters (where's Ben?  Maeda?  Daniel?  Wayne?) ...Pass on this one.  Play the original again.\n",
      "man this is a poor game i bought it, played it for an hour and thought this cant be it but it is... theres no voice acting so the atmosphere is cack and the battle system is really bad. a game like this relies on gut feeling and instincts, not to be told how much hp was taken off the player should not be told. The cut scenes are good and the camera at the beginning (i sold it after that) was reasonably good. This game just feels like a sub-par resident evil. Even the graphics are not upto resie standards the developers didnt use pre renders like capcom so the areas look ok at best. The enemies are reasonably well animated and look solid enough but dont provide the visual oomph that resie's deadites do. You shouild be able to see the flesh hanging off them but nope. Whats with the rpg elements too? Again it detracts from the atmosphere when you recieve bp or whatever from kills and use it to upgrade, it just doesnt work and feels tacked on. If they were goimg to do something like this then they could have ,made it at least a bit more in-depth like other rpgs.  There are many faults to this game and all add up to a below standard rpg/action type thing. not good at all. If you're wanting survival horro best check out resident evil 2.\n",
      "Usually when a descent game comes out, you'd expect the follow up to be better. This is not one of those games. For what ever reason, somebody decided to completely remove the wrestling ring. You start out in a back lot & just brawl. Here's the strange thing. To win you pin your opponent on the floor. If its a brawl, you'd think you just have knock out your opponent. You can move from one area to the next, but there is no ring. If I wanted a fighting game, I could have bought something else.I also didn't like the selection screen. It's divided where you can't see all of the wrestlers in the game. The only good aspect of this game is that the commentary from Tony Schiavone & Bobby &#34;The Brain&#34; Heenan is good. That's not enough to make it a great game though.\n",
      "WCW. It stands for World Championship Wrestling, but maybe it should stand for either We Can't Wrestle, World's Crummiest Wrestling, Wheel Chair Wrestling, or We Can't Win. Either way, Backstage Assault reflects on all of these factors.In Electronic Arts' second WCW attempt, this game makes Mayhem look like a frickin' masterpiece. Let's just do a quick run-down: the graphics: horrible. the gameplay: you've seen better. believe me. the sound: why won't the announcers SHUT UP??I'm not gonna even bother rating this on my usual scales. I give it a 0. This is pure garbage. avoid it.\n",
      "I love wrestling sure, I love video games sure. But WCW: Backstage Asssault is NOT wrestling and it's hardly a video game. When EA came out with its first WCW game, WCW Mayhem, I picked it up on opening day. And a day passed and my copy was back on the store shelf. I was looking forward to backstage assault, hoping EA would correct their mistake. NOPE. again my copy is back on the store shelf. First off, I am a wrestling fan, and I love harcore matches. But no ring in the game at all? Wrestling is not just fighting backstage it requires a ring to wrestle in. The graphics run as smooth as silk, I'll give them that. But the sound? Bad. The create a wrestler was the same as mayhem with very few tweaks. Save your money and buy Smackdown 2: Know Your Role. At least thats good\n",
      "A horrible game that features all the top stars of the defunct company and no ring whatsoever.\n",
      "Ouch. This game is just...ouch. Maybe the developers behind this didn't test the game. At all. That might explain the atrocious gameplay we see here today. The music is the only plus (and that's only because George Williams composed it). Yoda must be rolling in his grave.\n",
      "When I started playing this game the first thing that hit me was the terrific battle scenes that were displayed in the well done opening credits and the very similar feel that the game had to romance of the three kingdoms.  Unfortunately after game play began all my hopes for the game deteriorated into a free-for-all of unrealistic combat between armies that I had little to no control over.  I had hopped to be able to have some amount of control over the game but instead I found myself watching volley after volley of animated musket fire and screaming at the computer to let me do something.  Somehow I managed to beat my way through most of the game despite having no concept of the controls.This game is not worth any amount of money, if you wish to play it find a friend and play his copy, renting is simply too much money.\n",
      "I thought this was going to be like Ghengis Khan for the original Nintendo, but on a grander scale.... it turned out to be more like chess on a grander scale.  The graphics are alright, the game play is lame, and the movies are pretty much the same.  It's not as advertised.\n",
      "As a long time fan of the NBA Live series, I can honestly say that I purchased the PS2 almost only to play this game.  NBA Live 2000 was so good, with the challenges and the unlocking hall of fame players, that I expected this game to blow my mind.  Unfortunately, it only blew a hole in my wallet.First off, the gameplay is sluggish and staid.  Player movement seems barely a step faster than slow motion video.  Power forwards like Elton Brand are treated as 2nd class players, not able to score and rebound.  The post up moves are a big yawn, given the game's focus on guards.Secondly, they eliminated the 'fantasy draft' option whereby all the players are stripped from their team and reordered based on your and the computer's picks.  This option was made even better in NBA Live 2000 as when you unlocked the classic players you could thrown them into the draft too.  We had Wilt and Karl Malone as our back court for example.  In this game, none of that is possible.Finally, the graphics are subpar.  Not only are the faces unrecognizable, but if you notice, all the ears of every player have this white 'glint' in the middle of the ear, making the ear look misshapen, like the slave race that served the Shape Shifter Dominion rulers in Star Trek Deep Space 9.  In addition, no one has tattoos.  I care little for them myself, but given that almost every NBA player has one, what is the point in not doing it here?To be honest, I was so disappointed in this game, I considered returning my PS2.  If you have any desire to get an EA sports game, get Madden NFL 2001, that is an example of what the PS2 can do, and an example of how EA could have done their NBA franchise.\n",
      "One of the most anticiptated sports games for the Playstation 2 turns out to be one of the 1st bombs for the system! I've been an EA sports- NBA Live fan for over 8 years now. Playing it on all the major systems; like, Playstation, PC's, Genesis, Super NIN, etc.. So I'm a devoted NBA Live fan. This game is a complete disgrace to the series! You can tell that they rushed the product to compete with other games that came out the same time; like, ESPN NBA 2 Night and NBA Hoopz.Okay, let's go over the Pro's of the game. Yes it's got Michael Jordan in it, and yes it's got classic legendary teams on it. Overall though, I don't think that balances out the Con's of the game. The biggest disappointment being the response time from when you hit the buttons, to the time it actually does the movement. You can press the button to shoot the ball, and release it before it even does it on the screen. It's that bad! The movements are pretty choppy also, it's not fluent. You can be driving to the hole, and it would be real sluggish. Also, the percentage ratio of making a basket is EXTREMELY low! You can be wide open for a 5 foot jump shoot, and completely miss 10 shots! You pretty much have to dunk it to score. Another big con are the players. Yes, the body shape fits the actual players, but none of the faces look anything like the players at all! I rather take a buffed out Reggie Miller with a face that matches (like in NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast), rather then the actual shape of a skinny Reggie Miller with the face of a complete stranger. What...some more Con's? Well, they took out the Franchise mode, from previous games, as well as the 3 point contest. Why, I don't know? Next year, they should bring back the Slam Dunk contest on the game (remember Jordan vs. Bird?). Just like they brought back fighting in hockey games!So overall, the game wasn't worth the $49.99. I thought it would match up with the same quality as NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast, (like Madden 2001 for PSX2 and NFL2k1 for Dreamcast), but it doesn't even come close. I'm getting tired of companies rushing to put out games. Don't they realize that when people are devoted NBA Live or Madden fans (or any game) would rather wait for a great quality game.\n",
      "I am a big NBA live fan, and i tell you this is not worth your time!  I have playd LIVE since it was on supernintendo, and this game is a waste!  The graphics are crisp, but the moves are slow, the play control is in no comparison the other versions of live on the PS1.  PLEASE do not encourage the purchasing of this game!!  EA sports did a HORRIBLE job, after madden 2001 they give us this weak title.....\n",
      "This game is absolute garbage.  I opened the box and I could've sworn my dog went in the house.  It is definitely not up to par with other NBA Live games.  Graphically, it looks like they should've released it on PS1 or Sega Genesis.  The players look nothing like the real thing unlike Madden for PS2.  The only highlight of the game is Michael Jordan and I feel sorry that he had to be in this game.  If you want an exceptional basketball game pick up NBA2k1.  If you don't have a Dreamcast just buy NBA Live 98 or Lakers vs. Celtics or even Double Dribble and you can get the same appeal as this piece of junk.  Don't buy it, Don't rent it, and if your friend has one beat him up and tell him that you never want to borrow it.  I have one for sale if anybody wants it.  Never been played.\n",
      "I have a Dreamcast and a Playstation 2 and except for maybe 2 or 3 titles I think the Dreamcast is winning in the gaming department. I bought NBA live and was very upset with everthing but the graphics. Now a days we expect great graphics what we want is game play, and in this area NBA Live 2001 hits the bottom of the fish pond.  NBA2k1 is far, far superior in every aspect.  I believe next year the makers of P2 games will finally use the potential of the system but for today they are not.  So  with that said if you want to play basketball go get NBA2K1 and leave NBA Live 2001 on the store shelves.\n",
      "Although I rather like the game and really enjoy the graphics and music of it, I now wish I hadn't purchased it at all. The game is rather buggy. It has a tendency to crash when you attempt to skip dialogue, and sometimes key items simply do not work. One of the online faqs I read explained in detail that sometimes an item simply won't work as it is supposed to, and in such a case, you basically have to start all over. Restarting your PSX/PS2 won't fix the problem. I had that happen 3 hours into the game with the library keys. What a waste of time. Good game; lousy quality control.\n",
      "Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a outdated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing.\n",
      "they never made a mac version of collector's.\n",
      "I played the demo of this game, and quickly realised that I would not be paying for the full version.I think it's a reflection of the game that used versions are currently selling at very low money, and it is a real shame, when this game COULD have been a winner.You are a secret agent type assassin given several tasks that involve thinking and sneaking around, instead of the usual guns blazing approach, and the graphics, levels, enemies, weapons, and scenarios are actually very very good. There is ONE big problem however, you CAN'T SAVE your progress as you go. Even if you play this game on the easiest level,you will find it very frustrating. There is a fine line between a game that isn't easy to beat, and one that's annoying as anything, and this one jumps that line with size 12 boots. You will find yourself playing for a long time, reaching so far in a level and then getting killed off, only to go back and start from scratch. I hope the programmers have learned from their mistakes as I see a sequel is now available. If you really like this kind of game, try &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; instead, it's much more rewarding.\n",
      "The basic idea behind the game sounds fun. You're an SAS officer, sent off on a number of missions to save the world. It's a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.The emphasis is on &quot;real-world&quot; fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.There are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in &quot;real-time&quot;. If you're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.This &quot;real-world&quot; emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance &quot;reality&quot; with &quot;fun&quot;. Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot (as it were).I couldnt even get past the first level on &quot;normal&quot; difficulty. I'm not that bad at games (I've completed Half-life, Star Trek Elite Force etc.), but try as I might I couldnt get through the first mission. I'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there's no save game feature, so you have to go back to the start of the level. A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I'd already completed, shoot the sniper... and then got shot by someone else. Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again!After I'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead.As far as the rest of the game goes, other than the outdoor maps, there is very little special about the graphics - they're pretty much Quake2 engine standard (sub Half-Life). All that running around, climbing ladders etc. is pretty passe these days (how old is Tomb Raider ?), and there is really nothing new that this game does.I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review. As it stands, without a save game feature, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. If Eidos get around to patching the game (there's no sign of it yet), and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again. As it stands, I'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition... &quot;The element is behind you!&quot; or Counterstrike.Pro: 1. The satelite camera is quite cool. 2. Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS.Con 1. You cant save your game. 2. Too easy on &quot;easy&quot;. 3. Impossible on any difficulty setting above &quot;easy&quot; (partly because there is no save game option). 4. No multiplayer. 5. Dodgy voice acting.\n",
      "You heard right, this game has no SaveGame. It 'saves' only at the end of each of the 13 levels. The levels are huge, and 1 shot can kill you, or raising the alarm, or 50 other things. They say it's for realism, truth is that Eidos wanted this game out by Xmas. Unless you like being very frustrated, and repeating a level from the start time after time after time, buy something else. If you played SOF on hard setting all the way through without saving, go ahead and get IGI, otherwise you'll have to play this game w/it's 'trainer'. It's a hack that gives you unlimited health, but that takes alot of fun out. Design is monotonous with only 10 buildings that just repeat level after level. So overall, close but no cigar. This COULD have been a cool game w/a savegame and more levels, but it's not. Try NoOneLivesForever or something else AT LEAST until Eidos offers a savegame patch. This game is 95% SOF(great game),and 5% cool, new ideas like cameras,alarms,real weapons, but without varied design &amp; all ruined by an unforgiveable mistake. Save your money.\n",
      "This is a game only for members of the Tomb Raider Fanatics Club. If you remove all the hyperbole and wishful thinking. This game is just another rehash of the older, CHEAPER, Tomb Raider titles.Sure, you have new weapons and some new moves but it all adds up to the same thing: A big yawn! The game's clipping problems and crazy camera angles made things even worse. People who gave this game a good review must have been in a very magnanimus mood, or they must really enjoy ogling Lara Croft's enormous &quot;guns&quot;.It's time for Eidos to stop milking this cash cow and deliver something different to the gaming public.\n",
      "This game isn't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1. For a release on the PS2 this is a pathetic excuse. You'd be better off buying Syphon Filter 1 or 2, or Medal of Honor for the PS1, or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the PS2.\n",
      "Is this PS2 graphics or just taken from the original PS? The graphics are for the most part dated and very weak looking and the game is only semi-fun if you play the multiplayer death matches. Personaly I prefer Unreal Tournament for PS2. If you want to buy this game at least rent it first, or if not, it's your funeral.\n",
      "no mercy has got to be the worst wwf game i have ever played. for one thing no mercy does not have special entrances like wrestlemania 2000 does. in no mercy  the titantron does not play when you make your entrance. also in no mercy every tag team comes out seperately and you have to buy everything from the smackdown mall and where's the fun in that? also the box says up to 10 backstage areas and there are only six. in conclusion smackdown 2 is the better buy.\n",
      "Well the game is good..... lots of players....but here are some cons............ lots of them.....1) They walk like girls.2) The weapons dont do anything.3) They dont bleed. After all the beatings.4) If you fall of the top rope or the hell in the cell. They will get  right back up. with out any damage.5)The season is soooo boaring..... my cousins fell a sleep, when i was playing it.6)Every time when micel cole interviews some one, after the interview he will srug like he has no idea of what the hell is going on.AND I COULD GO ON.................BUT LETS STOP..........CAUSE I AM TIERD OF TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE WORLD AND SAVING PEOPLE FROM THIS CRAP...... UR WELLCOME. :-)\n",
      "Rockstar, the developers of this awful game, sure have been pumping out the PS2 games. Smuggler's Run was fun and all, but this is just too bad. It fails in every way that a game can. The visuals are sub-par (PSOne games look 10x better than this), it controls like a cow, and the actual gameplay is repetitive and a chore to play. Not worth your time.\n",
      "I enjoy playing these old titles sometimes you find a gem you skipped over, and sometimes you find a turd. This game is a turd.Remember the earlier days of gaming when the box cover was usually more exciting than the game itself? Well it's pretty much the same thing here.Hands down the most incredibly difficult game you will probably ever have the opportune chance of playing. Nearly impossible to beat thanks to the games mechanics. You'll at times feel like your trying to take down a tank with a sling shot with the powerless weapon selection they provide you.The controls aren't that great but they aren't that bad. This is the first time I had to use a cheat code to survive in a game since Duke Nukem... and I mean the original side scroller version. This game is inhumanely difficult. You'll have 2-3 guys attacking you at once. While one is shooting with 100% marksman ship just draining your life away the other(s) will be kicking and punching you and knocking you down. So your getting both beat and shot to death. Sounds like it would be rare but it isn't. This happens 100% of the time when you have one armed and one unarmed opponent mix. Each armed gooned you come across is almost like a mini boss. Your guns will barely phase them while they're guns hit every mark and will kill you even if you jump and run around or try to see cover.Very poor game mechanics, and pretty inconsistent game play. The music is mundane and the artwork switches from fantastic to what is this supposed to be. Might not matter but in an \"anime\" game what's the reason for having several different artist with multiple renderings of the same character that look different in each one? Sounds like I'm being harsh but I just expected the in game art to look as good as the front cover and the opening scene. Instead it goes from Madhouse to Crayola crayon.\n",
      "The previews looked so cool. Get this, you need a TUTORIAL TO WALK. Yes, walking is a pain. WHenever you go sideways you actually strafe sideways, it is really inconvienient. The controls are terrible. You will see what I mean when you get to the first part of the training. You have to run around a room in an extremely short time. I had to do it like 8 times. Basically to beat it I walked straight, strafed left, then went backwards, and narrowly got it. Then the combos, they are so difficult to pull off. I honestly feel that the creators were trying to make it as hard as possible to lash out against the society or something.The backgrounds are terrible. I rented this game for one day and was fed up with it after 5 minutes of the first level. You honestly are going to see alot of boxes, in some of the most uninspired and retarted rooms ever. One room was a square. O thats right, they are all squares, with 2 or 3 boxes of course. Can't forget those boxes.The guns are the worst actually. When you shoot 6 bullets with a gun, mabye 5, your girl looks at the roof. She cannot hold a gun straight. The target practice is basically 3 targets going directly upward. I mean seriously, this chick is an operative, and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in 6 shots or less. O but wait, lets say she walks while she shoots, now magically her gun has no recoil and she is fine. So whenever you want to shoot anything and actually hit it with 2 shots or more, you have to move around. Want to know something else? The guns are stupid.The combos are hard to pull off, and worthless. I could care less about snapping that guy, I only have 2 arms. Jeez, it's like memorizing the dictionary, then repeating it word for word with the same exact tone and depth that you memorized it with.The game is terrible. Spend no money on it. Rockstar must of been payed to stop making this game, because I never see it anywhere, and that is a GOOD thing.\n",
      "This is the worst PS2 game I have ever played.  Boring, repetitive backgrounds, uninteresting weapons and characters, awkward control scheme, all on one disk.  I bought this game used a while ago for $12.00 and I still feel ripped off.Did I mention the graphics? This game was released close to the time of the PS2 launch, and it shows.  There are also some serious clipping issues.Simply put: Oni isn't worth your time.\n",
      "I love the first Power Stone. It's the best Dreamcast game in my opinion. And I'm also a big fan of the anime based on it. I never got to play Power Stone 2 until I got Power Stone Collection for the PSP, and I was REALLY looking forward to it, but it didn't meet my expectations at all. True, it did have some good ideas, but they were all so poorly executed! And don't tell me \"Oh! But this one has a 4 player mode!\". Who cares? That doesn't make it good. Plus this 4 player mode is nothing but a huge, disjointed mess! And then there's the new characters. These new characters are so boring and stupid. I don't even know where to start! Another thing is the announcer. He is SO ANNOYING. He says irritating things like \"This doesn't look good! You better be careful!\". No really? You think so, moron? Why don't you be a little bit more useful! But in conclusion, to sum it all up in a nutshell:The first game was a revolutionary and original concept for the fighting game genre and it was alot of fun to play. The sequel was nothing but a cash-in attempt that relied on style over substance and quantity over quality, and it's worth about $60 used? Glad I don't have to buy this abomination twice since I despise it so much. There's several other things I'd rather spend $60 on! And not just video games either. The original game is worth playing without question, but this sequel is nothing but a waste of time. It belongs in the same group of sequels as ones like Megaman X6, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Contra Force, Double Dragon III:The Sacred Stones, Final Fight Streetwise, Duke Nukem Forever, and any other sequel like those I just listed. Oh and by the way, none of the characters in Power Stone 2 have any endings either. They just escape from the castle, and you get a credit sequence. BOOOO-RIIIIIIIIIING.\n",
      "If you like Resident Evil, or First Person Shooters, this is not the game for you. This one fails horribly on both fronts. There is no look around feature essential to any FPS, so you can be standing right in front of something, and not be able to see it because you can't look down! Not to mention the fact that the plot is weak, and has nothing to do with the continuity of the other games. Steer clear of this one at all costs.\n",
      "WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! FOR THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES, THIS GAME REALLY SUCKS BIG TIME. THE STORY IS LAME, THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM PAST RESIDENT EVIL GAMES. FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED WITH A RESIDENT EVIL GAME. THESE TITLES WERE MEANT LIKE THE FIRST 3 RE GAMES, THIS GAME SUCKS LIKE RE DEAD AIM. IF YOU WANT A GREAT RE GAME, GET THE FIRT 3, PLUS CODE VERONICA X, AND RE 4, NOW THESE ARE RE GAMES. NOT THIS LAME RE SURVIVOR.\n",
      "Ok let me tell you this. RENT DONT EVEN DARE BUY! The only thing that kicks on this game is first person view mode. But this game is not even fun. You work for umbrella in some crazy city a little after resident evil 3 and you fall from a helicopter and get amnesia not knowing you are the most feared person in the world. You screw around killing zombies but you never ever ever get to have any fun at all. Whats with capcom now? Why are they so lazy now when it comes that they make even greater games than konami does. Now one game i reccomend is Resident Evil Code Veronica, its very fun.\n",
      "Resident Evil Survivor, the black sheep of the Resident Evil family. Compared to the rest of the Resident Evil's, yes, this game is bad. However, it is not unplayable. The lack of any and all save points means that you're going to have to go thru the entire game in one sitting...and that can be quite a challenge. However, considering how easy the game is, it's not because of difficulty. This game just is bad. Now, if you have a bunch of friends over who love Resident Evil like you do and you just want to be able to say you beat them all, this game does have some redeeming value. It's great for a laugh with a group of friends at just how bad it is. This game is more of a collectors item for those who want to have the entire Resident Evil series and who want to beat them all rather than for those who want a fun and enjoyable game to play. Stay away unless you're Resident Evil thru and thru. NnyCW for CapCity.\n",
      "All I have to say is that this game is horrible.  I found little in it I liked and I loved all the others in the RE series.I found the gameplay to be almost &quot;pre-RE1&quot;.\n",
      "This rates up there with my Sega GT review for worst game ever. Worst graphics I have ever seen for a playstation game and the system is in its 6th year now. All I want to ask Capcom is why release this trash to the public. I'm the biggest Resident Evil saga fan ever. I bought this game with high hopes and was let down by the biggest video game company in the business. I played it for about an hour couldnt take it anymore and threw the game out of the window. Capcom why I ask why?\n",
      "I LOVE the Resident Evil series. But this game, ow my, it's the worst game I have ever, ever played. I was thinking to burn the CD, but the fire could be really disappointed burning one bad CD. I know you won't find this helpful, but, on my opinion, DON'T LOOSE MONEY!\n",
      "This game is quite possibly the stupidest game I have ever played.  From the first (and ONLY) time I played it, it got on my nerves.  The voice acting is terrible and really annoying. In the very beginning on the boat, you walk into a room and the girl whines \"Ohh NOOOO, my jeans are RUINED!\" That did it for me, I just snapped the game off right there. The graphics are bad for the PS2, and the way the characters move is all jerky and repetative. They wave their arms when they talk and then kinda forget to stop waving them after they finally shut up. The combat system not very good, you just stand in one place and idly blast enemies with badly-animated spells. If you see this one on the shelf, don't even give it a second glance, just move on and get something else. ANYTHING can be better than this.\n",
      "if you buy this game you are buying a drink coaster - it is horrible - the comabat system is horrible - the characters are horrible - the graphics are glitchy and the controls leave much to be desired - THIS IS A LAUNCH GAME - which means it is one of the oldest games out - DO NOT BUY _ buy DARK ALLIANCE INSTEAD\n",
      "Orphen was another prime example of a rushed game that wanted to be a launch title. It contains a little bit of [bad] voice acting at the beginning, then from there they gave up and no one moves their mouth. As for gameplay, it's very limited, pretty boring, and overall lacking. ... I don't even know why they call it orphen. You just live out someone elses adventure as you join their party. The story is one of the worst ever made. ... my point is the story [is bad], and everything else about this game [is bad], it's the ... game that ever ... . Use the disk as it was obviously intended to be used as. A frizbee.\n",
      "This is by far the WORST role playing game I've ever played! The Battle systum (STINKS)! You have 3 buttons wich you equip weapons to, every button executes that weapon, but you can't move and the voice programing gets anoying! And the voice acting is VERY poorly acted! There is NOT one message you read in this game! It is all the charecters voices, so those of you who have no volume, are scrwed!And the story line, HA! The worst! It seems like a 4 year old worte it who knew \"cool words\" like \"damn\" and \"hell\" it is very sad! It is so corney you will die laughing!(actually, thats the best thing about it!)And the game play hours stink! And so does the ending! The graphics are good, but thats it! It is above all boring! oh! There are some cartoon clips that arn't SO BAD.And you have absolutely no options on where to go or secret places! You just go straight through the story line on what you're supposed to do!Do your self a BIG favor! Don't buy this game, here is my over-all raitings-(1-5 stars)Game play hours-**Battle systum-*Re-play value-*Storyline-*Graphics-****Music-***Sound effects-**Voice programing-**Mapping-*Neeed i say more?\n",
      "All this game has going for it is the graphics and the name.  Too bad it has absolutly nothing to do with the movie. This game is garbage....get Ace Combat 4!\n",
      "Don't be hooked by the fact that you can play as megaman or the other capcon fighters. The weapons of all the players are basicly the same. You shoot a bullent with your right hand, and you shoot a special large blast with your left hand. Thats all you can do!! Megaman does not have a large inventory of weapons like he does in his other games.The arenas are very small, and there are only about 8 stages. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SKILL INVOLVED. Based on how you select the difficulty level, the game will be either too easy, or impossible to beat.The only reason why people are giving this game a good rating is because they, or their friends, are trying to sell overpriced used copies.\n",
      "Okay, here's the gist of things.  EQ finally got to a point where it was almost bug free.......then out comes ROK.  They still run patch after patch trying to fix little problems, and graphics glitches....and then they come out with yet ANOTHER expansion?  Don't we get the picture yet?  It's not about quality of gameplay, people.........it's about the bottom line.  I could go into a 5 page dissertation on why I despise Verant and their company, and why the majority of people who are looking for a good gameplaying experience will walk away shaking their heads sadly....at the potential wasted, but I digress.  Fix the car before doing a brand new paint job.  Otherwise, you have something that LOOKS real great.......but goes nowhere.\n",
      "I expected this game to really rule. I thought to myself, &quot;Tens of thousands of players rpging together? It will be chaos! People will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion! Imagine my disappointment when I found that pking is not only disallowed(or restricted), in most servers, most players I talked to professed DISGUST at player killers! Worse, guards are now near invulnerable. What? Can't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard's plates and into his back? It's only an AI. I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun (dreary drugdgery, which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction.\n",
      "With all the great reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Yeah, it's dated, but I expected that. Some dated games are fun...I just didn't think this was one of them. I played it for about 5 hours on &#34;normal&#34;, which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play. The map is difficult to read/understand. The psychic abilities are okay, but switching to them takes a little time...enough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you. I found the interface a bit clunky.

      "In SEVEN GAMES OF THE SOUL, you play the role of an elderly caretaker of an abandoned amusement park. You are approached by the devil with a task: witness the stories of seven individuals, and decide whether their souls will go to heaven or hell. It seemed like a fascinating premise, and I was eager to see how it would be handled in a computer game.I'll admit it's my own fault for not making sure the game would run properly under Windows XP. It doesn't. It will run, but it isn't at all pleasant. The animated sequences get stuck frequently, and the audio is choppy. It's a good thing subtitles are available for the dialogue, although most of it is nonsensical, metaphysical gibberish anyway. As of this writing, there is no patch to make the game XP-compatible.But operating issues are only part of the problem. The puzzles, if they can be called that, are so obtuse you'd have to be some kind of savant to be able to complete them unaided. There is absolutely no logic to them at all. At a later point in the game, you're rewarded with a demonic assistant, but the clues it offers are invariably for activities you've already completed. Apparently the clues are based on your physical location, not how far you've actually progressed in the game. Except for a couple manual tasks you need it to perform, it is useless.The graphics are fairly nice, but interacting with things is also problematic. Hot spots are frustratingly obscure and you can move over them a half dozen times before they register. Occasionally, they are misplaced entirely. There is one room you can't exit until you make a quarter turn away from the door and click on a blank wall. And I am currently at a standstill in my game because a drawer I need to open will not open. I have gone over every inch of that room to no avail. What good is a game that you cannot finish even with a walkthrough?SEVEN GAMES OF THE SOUL (or FAUST as it is referred to in the game itself) is a huge disappointment. It could have been interesting, but it getting through any portion of the game was torture.\n",
      "Where to begin with this boring game? As a hardcore Final Fantasy fan, I find it hard to start on how disappointing this game is.First of all, the characters. They're lame. The main character is this stupid monkey boy who's part of a theater troupe. That's not very badass! After making the super cool ex SOLDIER Cloud and SeeD in training Squall, what was Squaresoft thinking? Did they not look back at the past final fantasies and get that the protagonist is supposed to be a badass? Losers hanging with this failure of a protagonist include a little kid with no face (who came up with THAT design?), an annoying guy in armor who always jumps up and down, a girl with purple hair (lol, is this an supposed to be an anime?), and another girl that's named after a weapon she doesn't even use, awesome. None of these characters are as awesome as Barret or as hot as Tifa and they all look like they came out of a cartoon, another failure on Squaresoft's part.Next, the story. It's stupid. The only thing I can recall from my boredom is that it involves stealing a princess during a play performance (wtf?) and preventing an airship from blowing up or something like that. The main villain is some fat blue lady. What the hell is that about? While playing this I just sat there wishing Sephiroth would jump into the scene and stab her! I stopped playing after the first disc, where in the end some white haired chick looks down at the dead characters and flies off on a dragon (was that supposed to be a female Sephiroth or what? who cares) The world was boring. It was all castles and medieval crap like that. Hello! Final Fantasies are supposed to take place in futuristic worlds with technology and guns!Lastly, the battle system. What a pile of crap. Only the stupid kid can cast black magic, the girl is the only one who can heal, and the other guys are the only ones who can use real weapons. What kinda system is that? It's like they're each supposed to have a designated role! You're supposed to have 'em learn spells though materia! Oh wait, only REAL Final Fantasies are allowed to have materia, my bad. Also, why do you control four party members? First of all, that makes this game even more confusing and stupid, and second of all, REAL Final Fantasies have only three party members!In conclusion, this game fails to please any Final Fantasy fan due to to Squaresoft's failure to take a look at the franchise's  roots. If Square had looked back and reflected on what made Final Fantasy such a great series to begin with, they would have known this game would be a disappointment to any longtime Final Fantasy fan such as myself.\n",
      "Everybody is always saying how FF 9 is great because it gets back to the roots of Final Fantasy.  But this game is nothing like FF 7 at all.  It doesn't come anywhere close to FF 7.  Its got wacky graphics, and a boring, kiddy storyline, and the combat system in 9 is just way too simplistic.  FF 9 is just another stinker from Square, which is what all us super-fans have come to expect. If they don't get it right next time, I will swear off Square games forever.  That includes FF 7, so that would effectively be like commiting suicide, because without FF 7, I'm sure I would enter a permanent vegetative state. Get it right Square, or I will never be able to forgive you.\n",
      "Beautiful Game. It's just that this game gives you the worst directions EVER for you to follow and then expect you to find it while throwing a random battle at you every 3 seconds that you walk. Annoying as hell.\n",
      "A lot of FF9 fans are immediately going to say my review is poor simply because I'm disagreeing with them. Please know that this is not the case... I've spent many years of my life playing, analyzing and reviewing the installments of the Final Fantasy series, and with FF9 I am most dissatisfied.It's very difficult to find where to begin in expressing exactly why this is the worst installment of the Final Fantasy series ever. For starters, I'm going to warn the consumer that if you've played other FF games in general (the good ones... 8 doesn't count!), and compare them to FF9, then you are most assuredly not going to like this game.The first thing wrong with this game is the mere theme of it. FF9 has a character and plot theme that is so frustratingly childish and kiddy-friendly that one could mistake this for a Gamecube game. In all honesty, that's an understatement. The music only contributed to this flaw... the music track could go into a Disney movie, most assuredly, without notice. Last time that I checked, Disney does not belong in FF, despite what Uematsu (composer for FF9) thinks. I should also point out at the beginning of my review that I guaruntee that this is the shortest game in the series. The first CD to this game will still be spinning in the CD case from the leftover momentum of its rotation in the PS when you complete Final Fantasy 9. It IS too short.I'm not ignorant enough to be driven away just by theme. The battle system and process of character growth is easily the most uncreative and fun-lacking system in the series. You learn your abilities from weaponry and items, which means that before you can upgrade to the next level of weaponry you must finish the painfully slow process of acquiring all the abilities on that particular item. Challenging, I do admit, but not the least bit fun.FF9 promised its oldschool fans that it would once again display the old-themed characters like Black and white mages, thieves, etc. Don't be fooled... this is hardly true. What you get in this package is two PC mages of both classes, a brief encounter with a Red Mage, and some old names. Oh yeah, and the main character is a thief, but his abilities have nothing to do with being an oldschool FF thief. That's about it for this game.Mark my words: The Chocobo sidequest is NOT fun. It consists of your running around in a single location for several hours, gathering treasure and collecting points. You can buy special stuff with the points, but you're going to have to spend an AWFUL long time in there to get anything useful. Another illusion set by squaresoft to make you believe its fun? I think so.Most importantly, the plot was the killing stroke for a game that had no potential in the first place. The plot twist to this game is a left-fielded, ridiculous and random event with no foreshadowing whatsoever. Worst of all, it didn't even bother me story-wise, mostly because there was no reason for me to like any of these characters. I mean, I was more emotional about my Black Mages in FF Tactics, and they didn't even SAY anything.If you're looking for oldschool, on that note, I strongly suggest FFT. Not as good a plot as FF7, but definitely much more solid gameplay. If you're looking for an FF game that is not bad, do not buy FF9, by all means. It is NOT worth your time. In fact, I think FF10 is an apology for this horrendous waste of CD's. The playable demo on jampack is superb!(...)\n",
      "Just about everything they could do wrong...they did wrong.  The interface is absolutely awful. The characters move in this pokey slow manner that make you want to scream.  Getting at spells goes through a multi level menu.  The combat is almost exactly like the old turn based Pool of Radiance from five or six years ago. I take a shot, then you take a shot then he does, etc.  Utterly lame.  The adventure is completely linear.  It gives you no choices and leads you by the nose.  Often you don't even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well.  When you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you.  Please, please, please save your money.  Buying this would only encourage them to put out more garbage.\n",
      "I'm thinking, 'Alright, Pool of Radiance is finally out'. So I pay my 50$ and drive home to install it. I chose Drive D, not C, but it's still on my C dirve? Oh well, let's play.I'm still waiting to play. You can't escape combat. That's a big minus considering the monsters in the first dungeon are way more powerful than your whole party.Why can't I choose what skills and feats for the characters I generate (which are still the only characters in my party)? The customising of characters is nil. I so much prefer Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 even though I only get to create just one character. But those games are way more fun than this game.What's with the movements? My newborn baby moves faster than these guys can walk. Excuse me sir, do you carry any magic items? No. You don't really carry anything. I'll just take my gold and leave.Basically, a big &quot;THIS GAME REALLY STINKS, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, BUY HOOKED ON PHONICS 'CAUSE IT'S PROBABLY WAY MORE FUN THAN THIS RPG (IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?).\n",
      "PoR has to be the most disappointing CRPG release ever. I played the original gold box games when they were released, and this does not live up to the legacy. There are numerous crash bugs, a tendency for the save files to become corrupted and unusuable (wave goodbye to hours of play), a horrible user interface and the most unbelievably awful gameplay system I've ever had to slog through. I imagine that SSI, before starting development on PoR, had two folders available: one for the best features of the gold box games, one for the worst.The devs picked up the wrong folder before starting.The combat is terrible. It amounts to waiting (slowly, even with gamespeed set to max) for monsters to make their way towards your party and then, just as slowly, attacking them. And SSI brought in the 2-part turn method which was definitely NOT one of the endearing features of the gold box games. It makes for redundant effort and a great deal of wasted time. On the other hand, I *am* getting a good deal of reading done while waiting.People have complained that comparing PoR to the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale/Planescape:Torment run is unfair. I agree. It's horrendously unfair to take a beta-code &quot;game&quot; which shows little to no knowledge of, to say nothing of love for, the D&amp;D license and compare it to the magnificent efforts of Black Isle Studios' products. It's like setting a flea against Godzilla.PoR is the favoured acronym for this disastrous undertaking. Advance the last letter forward one letter in the alphabet and you'll have a better idea of what this game truly is.\n",
      "I'm really sorry if any of the developers of ROMD are reading this, but this game is a dog.  DO NOT buy it.  Go buy one of the Baldur's Gate games instead, or wait for Neverwinter Nights.  I was so disappointed by this game because it could have been so much better.  As the first D&amp;D 3rd Edition game out there, it had the opportunity to define the standard by which others would be judged.  Instead, it failed to qualify as even remotely fun, especially in comparison to the Baldur's Gate games.Plenty of other reviews talk about the numerous inexcusable bugs (like the install/uninstall problems) or the painful game play (why exactly can't I send party members more than one screen away from the leader?), so I won't get into it here.  What I would like to know is:a) how could the people who slaved on this game night and day for god knows how long not realize that the game was fatally un-fun?b) how could these bugs have slipped past QA?So much potential.  So disappointing.\n",
      "Let this be a lesson to all game companies: Take your time and develop the game fully.  Rushing it out the door to take advantage of the hype results in a bug ridden game that ends up in the budget bin faster than the speed of light.  Do not buy this unless you are prepared to be frustrated and send it back.\n",
      "I pop in the disc and select install. The game refuses to let me do a full installation because it says I don't have 1 gig of space free on D:\\(When I clearly have 5 gigs free). So, I have to do minimal install. I then finish installing it and go to play the game, only to learn that it didn't install on D:\\ drive. Apparently, I need to download a patch just to install the game to D:\\. Wow, the creators sure messed up on something so fundamental. They must not have even tested the game because apparently, you can't install the game in any specified folder unless you download patch 1.1.Then I go to play the game only to see my characters walking at 2 miles an hour. I start it up with a paladin, barbarian, and rogue tearing the place up while my mage sits down and rests. I then realize that my characters don't have their long swords equipped. This is odd because I just equipped those long swords. I look at my inventory only to learn that there is no long sword animation. I have the sword equipped but I can't see it because I guess the creators left that out or the minimal installation(which I was forced to use) must not have it. This pisses me off greatly. I then look around for quicksave. Where is quicksave? I have no clue. You can't customize your controls or something. I then give up on the game to play Icewind Dale. The games have the exact same stories, and Pool of Radiance has so many problems that I don't ever plan to play it again. Besides, if you do find a sword that does 585598250298 damage in the first dungeon, you know theres a problem.\n",
      "This game is the biggest disappointment I've ever seen, and being an avid fan of the Gold Box series, it doubly hurts.Beware at your own risk if you buy this one.  And don't even try if you are running 2000/XP.  According to Ubi Soft, these are \"Business\" operating systems, and we should not expect to run their games on a business operating system.But I was asking them about XP Home?  Last I checked, that wasn't considered by Micro$oft to be a business operating system.It's this arrogance and negligence by Ubi Soft that will convince me never to buy another game from them again.Anybody want an opened, unused version of POR?\n",
      "...have i place such high expectations for a RPG only to receive a game that's barely playable, i got it the first day out but there are now known technical issues with the release of this game. after 2 hours of playing, my saved games were utterly corrupted and the game crashed consistantly back to the desktop. i have to manually delete some files just to be able to play. other technical issues have been raised in various forums that i will not address since i will assume that a workable patch will be available by the time this review is posted; instead i will mention the gameplay itself.graphically, the game looks nice but it only has one resolution of 800x600 so you see a limited view of your party's immediate area. the pathing AI during combat is horrendous, often taking a longer route than necessary... this sometimes leads to your character running by an enemy, giving them an attack of opportunity against you; this can also negate your ability to attack -- depending on how far you need to move to an enemy, you may or may not be able to attack, taking a longer route even though it initially shows an attack icon means a wasted move. it's also hard to position your character to score flanking attacks. the combat manual is almost too cumbersome, though hotkeying commands help.i like the point-buy system of generating your character's ability score which is sanctioned by AD&amp;D rules and a very fair way of managing your needs. but your character starting equiptment sometimes doesn't make sense. your characters generally have a range weapon, a bow or sling, but no ammuno... arrows are really hard to find and was not sold by the first trader you meet (i haven't come across another trader/shopkeeper so far), yet most of the orcs you meet will launch arrows at your party.this game follows 3E rules but pre-determines each character's feats, skills and abilities without input from the player. the characters does not appear balanced, the ranger for instance does NOT have the ability to use dual weapons (no one can) making the class much weaker than other fighter classes; the favored-enemy is pre-selected (at least on level one).getting to level 2 is fairly straight forward but getting from level 2-3 is TEDIOUS -- it feels like most of the enemies encountered rarely provide much experience points. sometimes the enemies seemed harder to fight because your characters are so weak -- at level 2 your will face shadows and wraiths and only one or two of your party will have magical weapons at that point; once you are in combat mode, there is no way to retreat.since you HAVE to keep your party together, you also can't send one character to do advance scouting (this oversight will be a huge disappoint especially if you play the multi-player mode).overall, this feels like an unfinished game that's more of a dungeon crawler (with lower resolution and much less loot) than a true RPG -- the plot line so far is fairly trite. i am just severely disappointed that this game is linked to the excellent gold box series -- maybe it's unfair to make the comparison but if you carry the name Pool of Radiance, you've got to deliver.\n",
      "Pool of Radiance shows every sign of being rushed to market despite obvious problems in the user interface and serious bugs. It's only redeeming feature is a turn-based combat system that is deeply flawed and the ability to save at any time which is very important.Let's start with the boring and repetitive dungeons which look like they were expressly designed to antagonize the players. Long detours are required to travel between nearby locations. The automap is almost useless as it consistently shows openings where none exist.... Frequently characters fail to take anything close to the obvious, direct route to their targets and consequently arrive there too late to take any further action. Often a character would walk through a cloud of death rather than take a shorter, clear route. However, the bad guys were just as stupid so I guess it evens up.The targeting algorithm is equally bad. All the characters are animated (wings flapping, etc) and even when the cursor is stationary they will move in and out of the target zone of an arrow or spell depending on which frame of the animation is being shown. Not only does this cause a problem when trying to target the character, but it causes problems when trying to target nearby characters, too. The angle of view also prevents you from targeting characters when there is a larger character in front (from the viewer's point of view, not the character's point of view)...The non-combat part of the targeting algorithm is also flawed. Quite frequently it was impossible to persuade the group to move to the desired location because of the angle of view (which cannot be changed). There are also artificial restrictions on how far characters can look and travel both in and out of combat.You can arrange your party to travel in a particular formation. This feature doesn't work. I had my fighters up front, thieves and clerics next, and my magic-user at the back. So why is it my magic user always seemed to walk into a room first? I couldn't get my fighters into combat until the bad guys had killed the magic-user because the silly sod was blocking the door. I wish there was a way for my fighters to kill the magic-user first.I lost several turns in each fight because the computer has a habit of ending your turns prematurely.It's also unstable. During about 100 hours of play the system crashed or hung about a dozen times. It also pauses for up to five seconds at a time with annoying regularity. I would expect this from a FPS game, but not an isometric view. Diablo never hung once.All in all, this loses to Diablo in every way except the turn based combat (in theory, anyway) and the ability to save at any time (which I really like).Two thumbs down.\n",
      "When I first heard they were continuing the Pool of Radiance series, I was very excited as there were some of the best D&amp;D adaptations ever brought to the PC.  They were intriguing adventures that finally implemented what seemed like the complete rules.Once I finally got it installed (forced to install to C: regardless of directory chosen), I was sorely disappointed.This game is a sad hack and slash adventure in slow motion.  The other reviewer hit it on the head with 'Diablo done slowly'.  You crawl through the dungeon, fighting groups of orcs after groups or orcs (or skeletons, or zombies, or whatever) resting after every fight and talking to almost no NPCs.  Additionally, in order to compensate for D&amp;D's purposely slow leveling, they had you magic items like they're throwing out pocket change.  I have low level characters with some stats 20+ (supposedly godlike) because of the equipment they are wearing.The game seems pointless and less than thrilling.  At least it won't flare up your carpal tunnel as much as clicker games like Diablo, but it's the same type of game.  The random adherance to the AD&amp;D rules is frustrating, and this game does not deserve to be called D&amp;D.  Fortunately, they put 3 seperate intro videos into the load procedure, so I'll constantly be reminded of who released this garbage and avoid their games in the future.  I may continue playing after the patch comes out and the sound actually works.  Until then, I'm afraid to uninstall after reading the horror stories of people losing their OS during an uninstall.Avoid this game.\n",
      "As I continue to play Pool of Radiance, my opinion of it has grown steadily worse. This is the third review I'm writing on it, and for the first time, I'm wishing there was a '0 stars' rating. As has been thoroughly pointed out, this thing is the ultimate bore. You will find raking leaves in your backyard more fun than playing it- I guarantee that.What's more, since I bought the game I've started playing pen and paper D&amp;D, and I can assure you that this game does NOT follow the 3rd edition rules to any reasonable accuracy. The designers cut more than corners on this production, to the point that it's more like a demo version of D&amp;D.I'll just list off a few things (I'm sure I'll think of more later):-Weapons are restricted by class. They aren't supposed to be- anyone should be able to use anything, but sometimes at a penalty.-The wizard, druid, and bard classes are not included- probably the most glaring omission.-You are supposed to be able to choose skills, and a good three fourths of them aren't even implemented.-Spellcraft is actually supposed to be useful, because you can cast counterspells. You can't do that in Pool of Radiance.-A wizard is supposed to be able to cast on the defensive to avoid an attack of opportunity. No such thing here.-Enemies are only supposed to be able to make one attack of opportunity per round. In the game, it's unlimited.-You aren't supposed to be able to critical hit or sneak attack an undead creature.-(this should be obvious) Pool of Radiance is missing about 90% of the standard spell library. Included among the no-shows are such incredibly useful spells as mirror image, stoneskin, ANY summoning spell, ANY shapeshifting spell, and even most of the cantrips and orisons.-Clerics aren't supposed to cast spells like a sorcerer, save for either cure or cause wounds spells.-Clerics don't get domain spells-Spellcasting is limited to sorcerer spells fixed per level- no empowering, extending, quickening, etc. No casting lower level spells from higher level slots.-The game is completely missing any and all combat modes save a normal attack and spellcasting- no tripping, grappling, disarming, etc.-You are supposed to be able to pick feats- and there are supposed to be many, many more.-Power attack is supposed to let you pick a number from your base and add it to damage. It only lets you pick max or plus half here.-Changing armor is supposed to take a long time. It's a free action in the game.-Drawing a weapon is supposed to be a move equivalent action.-Invisibility is supposed to force an enemy to guess where you are. The enemies don't guess- they know.-For some reason (probably a bug) sorcerers don't suffer movement penalties for encumbrance.-You can't have a familiar.-You're supposed to be able to maintain a 'Shocking Grasp' spell indefinitely after casting it.-Cloudkill is supposed to do more than make enemies grunt (another bug?)-They took the easy way out- there's no resistance other than spell resistance.-Spell components aren't implemented (I don't mind this much, but some people do)-Obviously, there are no skill checks other than finding and disarming traps.And after all this, I have also decided the graphics aren't even that good. I had thought them the only strong point of the game earlier, and now that I've been further into it, I can assure you they are not. There's simply NOTHING NEW as you go on- everything is the same tile of wall, same table, same barrel, et. al. Give me a break, UBI. I know you can do better than that.\n",

Oh man this was fun! You sort through all your ingredients and apply liberally. You have the traditional meats and cheeses and veggies. You also have all sorts of seafood and insect life. Ew, right? Well, you open franchises in different countries and hey, tastes vary. What else is fun when you're making your pizza is they have a \"Chopper\". You can click your ingredient over the chopper and it'll dice it smaller and smaller and it's graphically correct and adorable. Cheese starts as a block (chopper chopper) and then it's a thinner slice (chopper chopper) and then it's small chunks, and then shreds, and then sprinkles. How cute! Tomatoes go from whole to halves to quarters to slices to paste! Fun!The Cons:I'm ashamed to say that I couldn't figure out how to play this game for the life of me. Being impatient, I just jumped on in and thought I was going to kick some butt. After about 20 minutes I was still staring at the screen, clicking on various things.Aaaaalright, I'll take the tutorial. It turned the light bulb on in my head in terms of staffing, decoration and purchasing supplies. Frustrating though...I clicked on everything on the screen before I'd click on what it wanted me to. The graphics are loud and confusing. What does a big face mean? Staff? Syndicate? Exit?Oddly enough when I started my next game I couldn't find ANY of the buttons that were there in the tutorial...I couldn't find the staffing, my \"information history\" and couldn't even figure out how to open my darn restaurant.Infuriating! I checked out my restaurant...it had some people and staff in it...but when I clicked around it sent me to some other restaurant. I sure the heck didn't open that one or decorate it, where'd it come from? Argh!You have the option of having things done \"automatically\" for you in various areas (Select them when you begin your scenario if you'd like) but doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of building your own Pizza Empire?\n",
      "You can find one for a good 5 dollars at any local store. Completely avoid this 15 dollar rip-off.\n",
      "Because of what I consider to be a significant flaw, this is a somewhat superficial review of Armored Core2. Armored Core 2 has great graphics and even, nicely designed missions, although it often requires you to repeat completly unnecessary dialogs and setup sequences even for repeat attempts that only serve to waste time. Aside from that though, it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw. The PS2 has really great analog controls. Armored Core 2 doesnt use them. They say they use analog control, but they only use the 2 analog sticks as single push buttons. How can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the PS2. This would be bad enough on its own, but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous. If something is shooting at you from behind, you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged. They also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity. I might add, that the AI mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech. It is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control. The design it yourself mech feature is really excellent, and if it werent for the truly hobbling nature of the controls, this really would be a 5 star game. You will find my copy for sale online real soon now.\n",
      "... do not buy this game.  Don't rent this game, either.  In fact, don't even borrow it from a friend thinking, \"Hey, I'm not paying any money and I have a few hours to kill, so what could I lose?\"This is easily one of the worst RPGs I have ever had the misfortune to play.  Ever.  The plot is contrived at best due in part to an absolutely ATROCIOUS translation (which can't settle on how to spell the names of important places/people).  The psuedo-new-age music seems to be interesting for the first five minutes, but the utter lack of variety in the soundtrack had me wanting to claw at my eardrums so I wouldn't have to suffer through it any more.The battle system is very broken; you could be standing right in front of a monster and still not hit it no matter how much you swing at the fool thing.  The upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken.  You need to repair your weapons and armor every few monsters you kill; more often if you use the special abilities certain items grant you.  And this is VERY expensive.  I was so frustrated because it seemed like by the time I'd killed enough monsters to recoup the cost of the last repairs, it was time to repair again.The only redeeming feature of this game is the graphics.  Even though they're a little crude by today's standards, they're still nice to look at in some cases.  Also, the character model will change depending on your equipment, so your character could be running around with a pumpkin on her head or a metal pot on his head.Overall, it's not worth it, though.  I never once thought that I'd get a headache just thinking about playing a game, but that's really how bad I found this game to be.\n",
      "I don't expect a game to blow me away with story, actors or any other things that goes into a movie. Because it's a game. It's just for fun. With that in mind I try not to rate games too harshly and also because there is usually some reddemming quality that I come away with that is good.  But not this one. The game just starts. No intro, nothing to show what is going on or why. Just straught into a Blood omen clone that ... There isn't any story in the whole game. Just move from place to place and kill things. There is no real reason for it.  There really isn't anything good in this game. It is years dated and uses nothing of the ps2 power. Metro 3d just put this sorry excuse for a game together and then hoped we the gaming community would waste our money on it.  There may not be alot of rpg games on the PS2 but they are coming. Save your cash for the good ones.\n",
      "I'm not going to give you many of my opinions on this game because there's no point. There's no shortage of opinion as far as how this game is. If you want to see how absolutely outstanding this game is, simply look at all the reviews below singing praises about this wondrous game. Let's just say, if you like repetition (I.E. Dark Cloud) times 30,000, you'll love this game.\n",
      "I thought this game said it had something to do with vampires.  I been fascinated with vampire lore for a long time and love some of the games that follow the old stories.  I guess I was looking for more of a Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain or Soul Reaver slant but guess what no dice.  This game wasn't by any means hard or challenging.  Total waste of what I paid for it in my opinion.  The sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired.  I am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting.  There are far better things to do with your time no matter how pitiful your life is trust me.  Skip it Move on and get over it before it consumes you completely.\n",
      "You are always told this as a child.  Well its normally ment that a good book will have a bad cover.  Well a bad game can have a good cover.  This is one of the first games I got when I got my playstation2 a few months ago.  This and GT3.Well I played it alittle bit and burned myself out on it pretty quick.  How many times can I go to a dungeon for the same item.  Gets pretty boring fast.This was a big Stink Bomb\n",

      "At first when I decided to play this game, I thought that it would be like Diablo, but was I ever, ever wrong. There was no storyline at all, the bird's eye view was horrible (I kept straining my eyes to see the characters, everything was so dark, except for that strange light that seems to illuminating from Anna, which I don't understand where it came from) and the music was awful. There would be loud pounding music one minute and all of the sudden it's silent for a long time....Strange.... The action was barely there, just run up to the monster and hack. It wasn't even fun after the first 30mins. The graphics isn't even worthy of PSone (maybe supernintendo). Dark Angel is neither an RPG game or is it an adventure game, I don't know what it is...except that it is boring! I wish I could give it zero stars.\n",
      "No story, character, graphics, controls suck. All I can say is that I'm glad I found this at EB Games for only $5. If I read all the negative reviews on here first before I bought it, I still would not have spent $5. That's pretty bad when a game isn't worth that and this is one. I played it for about 15 minutes and I'll never play it again. Don't waste your time on this one.\n",
      "This game is very horrible. I rarely give out one stars but this game so greatly deserves it.GRAPHICS:4/10. Pretty bad but not so horrible that you can't bear to look at it. Back grounds are actually done quite nicely.SOUND:4/10: There are some great scary growls and moans but there is no voice acting and the main character doesn't even talk.REPLAY:10/10. If you had the guts to play this game twice it would be just as boring as the first time ;DCHARACTERS:1/10: What characters? There's the main character and we know nothing about her.STORY:1/10. It's hardly fair  making a rating of the story because there simply is none.CONTROL:9/10. Ok OK  I'll admit there is a good side to this horrible game it's extremely easy controls.CINEMAS:1/10. Huh? What cinemas? There's no story so why would there be movies? Why would there be anything good about this game?OVERALL FUN: 2/10. This game is a crime against god. I recommend this game only if you enjoy games that [are bad].\n",

      "I was never a fan of the Playstation 2 controller.  I don't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad. Using an analog stick is annoying because you don't feel comfortable with it. Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad. With an analog stick, you slide all over the place. In addition to that disaster, the PS2 controller also suffers from \"too many buttons\". We shouldn't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game. The Playstation One had the best controller ever. It was comfortable, you were always in complete control, and it just looked better.\n",
      "This controller is undoubtedly the biggest POS ever made.  Since the PS2 came out around 5 years ago, I have probably gone through over 20 controllers through normal play and not from getting thrown into a wall(well, not until they're already non-functional).What's worse?  It's the best one out there.  I've had no better luck with any aftermarket controllers.I wish I could punch the engineer who designed this craptastic pile of poop right in the eye.\n",

      "First, there is nothing about this to really write home about. It is a memory cart. You have to have it else your PS2 is worthless as a game machine. Most games won't even play unless you have one, so you have to have one.My main gripe is the memory size. 8MB? C'mon! WRC and GTA3 both take up almost 1/3 of the capacity of this cart for their save games. And it is going to get worse.Where are the 64MB carts?Save yourself some money and don't buy this single pack.

      "First of all, I must say that when I was a kid, I had ALWAYS wanted a Sega Game Gear!! They Kicked the Gameboys butt!!  Color Screen, and an eight bit processor that was every bit as good as the internal processors for the sega master system (actually almost identical, in fact, you can actually get an adapter to play master system games on a game gear, and the adapter dosen't even take extra power at all nor have any processors inside of it, it just directly adapts a master system cartridge to fit a game gear, thats it) and to be fully honest, when you play some games that were made for the nes and the game gear both, most of the games look better on Game Gear, just to be totally honest. (I've had both systems, more on that later). One flaw in the system is the battery life. Not good!! It takes 6 AA batteries and this sucker will drain them in 4-6 hours (in my experience)one day, I was at a yard sale and low and behold, I found a Game Gear!! For $1!!! No Crap!  The sound didn't work, but it did work out of the headphones. Everything else was perfect!!  I played on this game gear for quite a while until the headphones stopped working as well. I looked it up online and discovered this is an EXTREMELY common issue with game gears. It turns out that when the game gear came out in 1990, there were a bunch of bad capacitors on the market at that time. Most of the game gears got these bad capacitors, not all of them, but MOST of them. I must say, that I do have a very extensive background in electronics, (I majored  in computer hardware design and repair in college.) So I immediately replaced all of the capacitors on the soundboard of the game gear. The speakers started working immediately, and the headphones started working great as well. In fact, when I got done with the system it was very LOUD out of the speaker!  I bought probably 20-30 games for the game gear and loved 70% of them, then I started notticing that the screen was getting almost impossible to see. You had to hold the thing at a very odd angle in order to see anything, and the contrast had to be all the way up. I looked this problem up as well, and guess what. When you replace the capacitors for the screen, you really must replace ALL OF THE CAPACITORS IN THE ENTIRE GAME GEAR in order to get it to work properly!!! I did this. For the longest time, I would even take my game gear to pawn shops just to show it off, time after time I was told \"this is the best screen I have ever seen on a game gear\" and \"I've never seen one of these work so well!! \" I would ask how much they would give me for it, and I heard anywhere from 70-80 dollars.  I loved the game gear, for another year if that (or 6 months) when the screen went out again. It was perfect after I replaced the capacitors, even better than the nintendo ds screens in terms of clarity and brightness in my opinion, now the thing wasn't working. So I opened the thing up one more time, to see that the screen was leaking fluid!!  Guess what, This is common as well!! Just replace the screen for 40-50 dollars for a good one!  I gave up on it!So basically, I do love the system, but do research on it! Not all of them have these problems, but MOST do!! If you have, or buy a game gear that has the sound going out of it, all of these other things WILL happen as well, its just a matter of time!  It may last a few years, or maybe just one year like mine did, but as I said earlier, do your research!Great Games include :Sonic the HedgehogSonic the Hedgehog 2Sonic Tripple TroubleSonic ChaosStreets of RageStreets of Rage 2Outrun (not Europa)GT RacerFormula 1Mortal Kombat 2Nba JamArch RivalsPaperboySonic driftSonic drift 2JeopardyWheel of FortuneFred Couples GolfJoe montana Footballmany many more!!Terrible Games (In my opinion)Monster Truck WarsOutrun EuropaMortal Kombatbasically every other racing gamebasically every other golf gamethat stupid tails gamethe Terminator Game ( cant think of the exact name, lol nor care to)crash test dummiesall loony toons gamesaladdinprobably more, that I haven't played.\n",
      "This game is has many things wrong with it.  First of all, the controls are some of the worst that I have ever seen.  There is no smooth movement in Oni.  It is very choppy, making it hard to control your character.  Second, the camera angles are horrific: there are parts were the camera decides to zoom and unzoom, especially when fighting and it makes it very hard to see who you are fighting.  The graphics are halfway decent but nothing worth looking at.  The best thing about this game is that I kept the receipt.\n",
      "I've never played the original Gangsters but I've heard enough horror stories to know what was wrong with it, but despite all the flaws people complained of everyone still seemed to enjoy the original.  So when I saw the sequel on the store shelf I thought to myself that it would probably have all those flaws improved upon while still keeping it's great strategy elements.  So I bought the game hoping to be able to live out my favorite scenes from the Godfather.  At first the game was amusing, but after those quick 10 minutes, the game was quickly repackaged and returned!First off, the strategy elements of the game are completely gone!  Everyone used to complain about the micro-management in the first, so I guess the solution was to completely erase all management. You're basically told what business to buy and it just generates money.The graphics are a bit cartoonish, but fitting.  Although the graphics aren't realistic or polygonal they match the theme of the game and give it the appropriate feel.  Unfortunately, that's all this game has!  Good looks, good packaging, no substance!The gameplay is terrible!  You'll pull your hair out as you order your goons to drive two blocks away and watch him circle around the whole neighborhood before finally going to his destination... and hopefully he's not there to do a drive-by!  The drive-by shootings in this game are just ridiculous.  You'll quickly despise watching your thugs drive past, shoot, make a U-turn, drive back, shoot more, make another U-turn, shoot (you get the point).  That doesn't seem like a very effective drive-by to me.  Also, the people standing on the side walk never EVER take cover, they just stand there shooting at the car until they are FINALLY gunned down.  What kind of dumb gangsters are these anyway?  The AI definately needs improving!  Also, don't get your car ruined.  If you do, then you have the option of stealing your enemies car, but only HIS car.  What sense does this make?  My thugs have no problem with gunning down police officers but they refuse to steal an innocent person's car.  I had to run 4 blocks (past rows and rows of perfectly good parked cars) to my enemies hideout to steal his vehicle.  But basically what I am saying is that the AI in the game is pretty stupid.Another thing that ruins the gameplay is the tedious and repetative missions.  The game is basically open this shop, do a hit on this guy, buy that building, place guards here, do a hit on that guy... over and over and over again.  And although carrying out a &quot;hit&quot; should normally be enjoyable, as you can tell from my paragraph above I found killing people to be quite the chore.So if all of the micro-management is now non-existant and all of the action is absolutely horrendous and silly, what does this game have to offer?  Simply put... boredom.  The game is just too easy, too simple, and too shallow.  Perhaps for the third game they should eliminate the tedious missions and make it more open-ended.  Just allow you to hire thugs and build your empire.  Also, they need to work on that AI a little.  Why do these guys get lost in a neighborhood that's 5 blocks wide?  And who ever heard of circling back around, better yet, making a U-turn while doing a drive-by?  You're supposed to shoot and then high tail it outta there!  Basically, it could have been a good game had they taken the time out to actually add some gameplay to it.\n",
      "Yes, the graphics are very good but the game is akin to an interactive painting. And so what about the graphics? Whoopee, most games have good graphics nowadays too but GOOD games have some meat to them. RealMyst does not; it's a very bland game for people who don't like real gaming experiences.After fifty minutes of looking at the pretty pictures, I was bored to tears and began the uninstall procedure. Phooey!\n",
      "I had never played Myst before and I wanted to give it a try because of its popularity.  My biggest gripe is that the game offers no options. Every game I know of allows a player to customize the controls.  I always use the inverted mouse look--pull back, look up; push forward, look down.  I use this in Quake, Unreal, Thief II,  Hitman codename 47, Forsaken, System shock 2, Half-Life etc. etc.  Real Myst does not give me a choice, and I am not going to change my personal style for one game.  The mouse is too sensitive, and there is no option to adjust it (as in other games).  The &quot;walk&quot; mode is way too fast.  So, just try playing a game where you seem to be running all the time, the mouse operates backwards, and is too sensitive in its left to right movement.  Well, I can just stand there and admire all the scenery, I guess.My system is a Dell XPS B733r (733 Mhz coppermine, PIII) with a geForce 256, 64MB DDR RAM 3D card, 128MB RDRAM, Soundblaster Live audio.  Actually, the music in the game is very nice, and the graphics great.\n",
      "Driver 2 is a poor game for the Playstation.The Wheelman is back in driver 2 for playstation and who truly cares about it?  Why this game was produced for the Playstation is beyond me.  This is a game that is meant for the PC and not the limited processor of a Playstation.  I saw the difference in the orginal Driver for Playstation and Driver for the PC and the gameplay experience was completely different.  I'll wait for the creators to code Driver 2 to the PC, so we can actually enjoy the game.  The graphics are horrible, horrible and horrible.  Anyone who says the graphics are excellent must have some bad eyes or have never seen any other game system besides a playstation much less a computer.  During the Gameplay it is very apparent that the coders of the game did not fully optimize the game for Playstation as you can see in many parts of the game where the framerate drops.  The framerate drops?  What the heck is this on a Playstation?  I have not seen any processor or memory upgrades for a playstation, so why would a game I am playing be too much for the playstation to play without any errors or holdups much less framerate drops.  This is totally ridiculous!  I have a very good feeling that the creators of Driver 2 made a PC version first then coded it back to Playstation format which would explain the buggy and slow gameplay in some areas.  I do have to admit the game is very fun to play and would be even more enjoyable if the game would actually be better than the orginal.  The mission are very good and you can pass them easily if your gameplay does not slow down, but if it does you will be pushing the restart button after you fail the mission.  The cutscenes are ok and I just love the beginning scene where the man with the sawed off double barrelled shot gun fires off about 8 shots without reloading, very clever indeed.  RENT, do buy this game unless the only thing you have in your house is a Playstation.  And if I see a Driver 3 for playstation, I might just drive myself into a wall in frustation.\n",

After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.(This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/27/2002)--------------------------------------------------I *LOVE*Grand Theft Auto 3(for the Playstation 2) and I wanted a game that would be similar to it. I know that no game, except for possibly GTA4, could even come close to GTA3, but I still wanted \"more.\" From what I read about this game, it seemed like a poor man's GTA3. I hadDriver 1on thePC, but could never actually play the game itself because I could not pass that stupid driving test at the beginning of \"Undercover\" mode. When I read that Driver 2 did not have a driving test, that gave me even more reason to want it.GAMEPLAYWhen I popped the game into my PS2, I immediately went into \"Free Ride\" mode so that I could get a feel for the controls and check out the scenery a bit. I didn't even move one inch when the cops were after me. Yes, that's right, I was STANDING STILL and the cops were on my b-u-t-t. If the cops are going to be on me like white on rice, I'd at least like to know WHY. I gave the cops no resistance, allowing them the chance to come up to the car and pull me out (like real cops would, and those in GTA3), but they thought it would be best to just keep ramming me!?!Since this game lacks the Police Bribes and the Pay And Spray of GTA3, the only way I could get the cops off my tail and reduce my felony meter (the equivalent of GTA3's Wanted stars meter) was to hitail it out of there in the hopes that I could lose them. Even though the game promises that you can wipe your felony meter clean by getting out of your vehicle and carjacking another one, since you can't get out of the car and switch vehicles while being wanted/chased, there's no practical use of this \"feature.\"I decided to try the main \"Undercover\" mode, hoping that it would be better. The first mission was simple enough. Get from point A to point B. The first time I tried it I failed it because I didn't get to the place on time (I was going the wrong way from the start). Once I figured out that all I had to do was make two lefts then go right every chance I could, I got to the destination with time to spare. Mission 1 Passed! Perhaps this game WOULD get better ... until Mission 2, that is!Mission 2 involves you having to follow another car. The problem is, unless you're (at most) two car lengths behind him, the game will say that you lost him and thus failed the mission ... even though his car is clearly visible on the screen! After attempting this mission three or four more times, only to get as far as around the corner, I had enough punishment and immediately decided to bring the game back to the store with my Mom's receipt to get a different game. ANY game would be better, even Barney The Dinosaur!Not even cheats codes could help make this game playable. I used two Game Shark codes to unlock the in-game Invincibility and Immunity (no felony) cheats. However, neither of these would help with mission 2. The Infinite Time Game Shark code would not work, otherwise I *might* have had a chance of barely playing the game ... the key words there are \"might\" and \"barely.\"GRAPHICSThis game has the WORST graphics ever seen in a video game of any age. Pong and Pac-Man look high-tech compared to this.There is more pop-up in Driver 2 than in a marathon of Pop-Up Video on VH-1. You look ahead and see an open piece of land. You plan to cut across that land in order to make the turn at a high speed without having to slow down (or just to take a shortcut). Just as you get within a car's length of that land, a building pops up out of nowhere. BAM! You crashed and damaged your car. Repeat indefinitely and you've got the graphics of Driver 2.REPLAYABILITYIn order to have replayability, a game must first have playability.TO BUY OR TO RENT?NEITHER!I wouldn't even give the CD to my dog as a chew toy.If it were possible, I would have given this game a 0 rating. Then again, it kinda deserves the 1 because it has one redeeming quality: it makes a great coaster!\n",
      "This is a wicked bad game. Its its also wicked hard. Basically all you do is run a round like a mad man and kill things. Sounds fun. Guess what. ITS NOT. I mean you have to repair your weapon!! What the heck is that all about. And theres boxes that you open and they turn into ENEMYS! YUCK!\n",
      "\"Zelda Killer?\" Only if that means copying Zelda in every way imaginable can make it superior. \"A league of its own?\" Not exactly, file this one with Legend of Dragoon as a predictably unoriginal, mediocre RPG. If you're looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the PS2, you'll have to wait even longer.Now let me clarify this: I have not played Zelda 64 nor do I own a N64. I did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of Zelda until I finished reading someone else's review a few minutes ago. That said, I still felt like I was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it. For sheer curiosity, I tried Zelda at a friend's house. Even the grunts Link makes in-battle seems to be stolen from this game.What is the gameplay like? For \"Zelda-virgins\" such as myself, it was pretty good at first. It was easy to jump into, and hard to put down for the first 5 hours or so. Good, until, after quite some time in the game, nothing really happens in the storyline (a Sony RPG trademark) and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay (yet another Sony RPG trademark), it failed to keep me within its grasps.The graphics, while good, are nothing spectacular. They quickly get tiresome when you're in the same dungeon for 5 hours or more. Every level of the dungeons look the same, so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay, you'll have no trouble there.And here's another staple, the immense amount of typing errors, the third sign of a Sony RPG. While there isnt much text, it was enough to make me want to send money to Sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pity.Georama is almost innovative. It would be if Sim-City hadn't done this general idea first, and if it gave you more freedom. The villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed. So picky that you'll wonder why Sony even bothered to let you build these villages at all.In general, buy this if you liked \"Legend of Dragoon\" or if you've never even heard of the Zelda series.\n",
      "I cannot believe how high a rating this game is getting. This supposed \"Zelda killer\" is nothing more than a dungeon crawl along the lines of Evolution on Dreamcast. Zelda tramples this bore into the dirt. It's got many similarities to Evolution: randomized dungeon levels, repeat visits back to town to restock on supplies so you can go back to the dungeon, bland enemies, that feeling of inane repetition. As for combat, where's the strategy? Where're the backflips, the dodges, the ability to take out an enemy in more than two fashions, the feeling that you're actually in the middle of a fight instead pressing one button a lot? Basically, you either combo them to death, or you use your charge up super move. Dungeons are bland. Basically, it's a bunch of rooms connected by tunnels. There are no puzzles or unique obstacles that have to be dealt with. There's no sense of discovery, no \"Aha!\" moments that are the great moments of Zelda style games. Every dungeon just feels like a dungeon. You're not discovering whole new worlds filled with nooks, crannies, and secrets waiting to be found, you're dungeon crawling, looking for loot and the key to the next level so you can do it all over again. Gameplay is repetitive. Venture to the dungeon, find the mystic balls and key, go back to town, build (which does have a minor appeal to it) and get supplies (did I mention your character has to have a drink of water every three minutes? Or that his weapon starts to wear down and break after killing five or six enemies?), venture to the dungeon and find mystic balls on the next level which looks exactly the same as the first. Ugh, ugh, ugh!\n",
      "I can't even really say this is a fake Zelda, because they tried to copy and came up with a repetitous counterfeit. Over 100 hours of the same thing, over and over again. I maxed out my sword and didn't even get a reward. I wouldn't wish this life stealer on my worst enemy, that's why I through it in the garbage. Negative -5 and yes, I beat it. Ocarina Of Time a positive +1,000 stars.\n",
      "This was a BAD game.  Graphics were sub-par.  Gameplay was easy.  After one weekend of playing, I almost completed everything.  For an RPG, give me a challange, please.\n",
      "This game is absolutely horrendous.  You go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces.  On top of that he gets thirsty every 30 seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker.  Very very annoying.  What is up with the building of the town?  I want to play an RPG not sit there and build a town.  If I wanted to manage a town I would go play Sim City or something like that.  I bought this game a  while ago, and played for a total of about 2-3 hours before saying &quot;screw this&quot; and shelving it forever.  I recently bought a game called ICO, which is also made by Sony, now that is a masterpiece (Sony's redemption).  This is a horrible title, go buy ICO instead you'll be happier...trust me.\n",
      "Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec tries to hide its craptacular and atrocious gameplay with the looks of a gorgeous racer. But then it's like when you look at a movie star on an HDTV, and you see its appalling horrors that lie within it. To start off the controls suck greatly. For example; when turning a corner you will notice how you can't seem to keep your vehicle on the road, and it constantly slips and swerves like you're driving in snow. Another problem; the absence of a sense of speed. When I was driving I never felt the sense of speed that should be in racers. Instead, it felt like I was maybe only going about 40mph or less. Problem #3; the lack of interesting tracks to race on. When going through the various tracks I never felt compelled to look at the environments around me solely for the fact that they were so boring. Problem #4; crappy career mode. Never, in my years of playing various racers did I ever go through a career mode that was so dull and made me feel so unwanting to complete it one day. Problem #5; crappy multiplayer. Wow, what a horribly dull and unexciting way to challenge a friend to a race! Here's how it went; we raced around the boring tracks, swerved like we were driving in snow, and we were totally bored. So, then he took the game out of his  PS2 and put in Kingdom Hearts... that is how bad the multiplayer is. The only positive thing; the amazing graphics, that was it.\n",
      "I just want to say that this is a racing game if u haven't already figured that out. If u like ur games to have a little more substance then u won't like this. I will admit that the built-in rumble feature on the controller really adds to the realism. It is very realistic, like when you get hit or go across a bumpy dirt road, you feel every hit and feel every bump, but that's basically the only thing it has going for it.\n",
      "This is a disgrace to racing and all car games in general... to bad such a powerful system does not have games like Metropolis street racing on the dreamcast.  Dont buy this game... it is horrible!\n",
      "This game is great if you have 12 or so hrs to spend getting your Drivers lic. There are a total of 42 test you must pass to get all 6 drivers lic. Infact, I wouldn't be suprised if it takes someone 24 hrs to pass them all. Shouldn't these test be optional? They could award cash or the best cars after finishing each lic test. But they make you go through this [garbage] of taking these useless test. I'm on the last test of my B lic. I spend nearly 5 hrs total. I doubt I will pass it. Sorry, but that is not fun!! I love a challenge but the developers made the test way to difficult..\n",
      "I hated the fact that you had to pass the damn license test before you could even race. Takes away the fun from doing what's really fun in the game...racing. There's a point where realism can stretch a bit too far...I know it would be realistic to have the liscense tests in there, as you would have to take them in real life. However, they are annoying and stupid and better off not being there in a game, something meant to entertain you, not bore and frustrate you to death.Also, there are the simulation of the handling and controls...my bro says it's for people who know how to drive well. Well, for the rest of us, could they not have implemented arcade style handling and controls? It would have been such an easy thing to implement, and I know it's not realistic, but it would draw more people to play the game that wouldn't otherwise.Finally, there is the fact that you can't crash, wreck or damage your car in any way, shape or form. This is supposed to be the most realistic driving simulation, yet I can hit a wall at 200 mph and just bounce off it and all that happens is that I slow down, maybe spin out or get turned around. Supposedly this is because the car companies that liscensed their cars for use in the game didn't want to see their precious pretty cars get smashed up in a freaking game. So it was either take damage out, or the game would've never been released in its current form. The only thing that could have given this an extra star is the occasional fun you have racing against your friends, but sadly it isn't enough.\n",
      "I bought this game because the reviews I read were glowing and it looked like it had good graphics.When I got home and loaded it (it took forever to install) I discovered that the game was 95% just walking around and talking to various characters. Some of the characters are homo-sexual and the language was terrible. I don't want to listen to profanity or some gay woman telling me about her sexual life. I just wanted to play an adventure game. I didn't want to hear all the gay talk. After about a half an hour I had had enough of this game.This game was totally boring with reguards to gameplay.The content was vial.The profanity was plentiful and totally uncalled for.I give this game my lowest rating.\n",
      "This is the dumbest mega man title yet. I was floored when i saw the game and first played it, but when i saw that there were no bosses and no charge shot, i felt betrayed. i did finish the game as i did not want to lose the money, just a big let down.\n",
      "They get in the way of the screen, and they show very little light.I recommend getting a Micro, SP, a GameBoy Light(doesn't work for GBA games), a DS(only GBA games), or just playing in light.\n",
      "Save yourself the trouble of having to return it. The worm light puts out very little light, and you have to try to position it so the light doesn't just reflect off the screen. The price is right, but these lights wear out very quickly. You would be much better off buying a light magnifier for your system.\n",
      "This light stinks. you barely get anything out of it and it wastes your batteries.\n",
      "This is a lousy product, period!  I purchased one of these cheaper memory cards and it worked for a month.  I had the pleasure of the memory card breaking when I was over halfway through Oni on the PS2 (you will have to have played ONI to know how upset I was because Oni is a really frustrating game).  Needless to say, I went out to purchase a memory card made by Sony after I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Sony Technical Support.  Oh by the way, Sony said to me that the 3rd party DVD remotes are not endorsed by Sony and they could potentially cause problems with the PS2 console, so I ditched the 3rd party remote I had too.Save yourself the time and money and just pay the few extra dollars for a memory card that is endorsed and manufactured by Sony.  That way you won't have to spend hour after hour of sleepless nights just to get back to where you were in the game you were playing because you had one of these cheap memory cards and it crapped out on you right at the middle of the game.\n",
      "I bought this memory card and was sorely dissappointed. The salesperson told me that the Sony brand ones (which were out of stock) were better, and I dismissed it as a Pro-Sony sales pitch. I shoulda listened. This card &quot;lost&quot; three weeks worth of saved games and data.  The company offered to replace it for free &gt;if they find it to be defective&lt;. Since it appears that the card only reformatted itself I can't see them replacing it, because &quot;technically&quot; it works. Too bad they can't recover all the hours of lost gameplay.I'm sticking with Sony cards from now on.... I've been burned by third party cards one time too many.\n",
      "The online adaptor works great with any online game that came out before 2004.  DSL is not compatible with this adaptor on ALL games created after 2004.  Do not fall for these other reviews.  I have DSL and I was able to play Madden 2004 online, but Madden 2005 IS NOT COMPATIBLE, I called EA Sports and a recording tells you DSL is not compatible with ANY EA games sold after 2004.  I tried calling my ISP as well as Sony but found absolutely no tech support on this subject.  How can you have 10 million users who have DSL and possibly make games that are not compatible with DSL I ask you?  Sony found a way.  Oh and don't think you'll be able to play SOCOM II online with DSL either, I repeat all newer games  will not work with DSL.  Don't get me wrong, I love the PS2, but man did they drop the ball with the online adaptor!!!\n",
      "This should basically be for a collector only because the Network is gone. I can't do anything with this product online at all. Sony is kind of bogus for shutting down the servers for the PS2 network because it would be fun to still be able to go on line and play with other gamers. Some one else should get something going again so this item is useable.\n",
      "This product for the PS2 that enables you to play online is an absolute rip. I have pleanty of reasons but let me give you the jist of it. Now see first of the price of the adapter alone is pleanty enough to put someone down. Hell I love online gaming but 40 some bucks taken out of my pocket to do it is a little too much. The adapter is fine within itself. The problem I have with it, is just the online capabilities. Now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your PS2 (...)takes way to much time. Another thing is the booklet which they give you and expect you to read it is like a chapter book not a manuel. In order to start playing you must put the disc in which is given within the package and sit through a long tidius process. It is not as simple as to plug it in and play instead they had to create a long difficult process.Another problem with this product is the capabilities with the games. First of the games are very limited...From that I mean the choice in which one has to play from. Eventually I know more games will come out...But eventually PS3 will come out won't it? Nevertheless for the games that are compatiable with this adapter the connectivity servers suck ass!! Playing from several of my friends house and my own the lagging and time it takes to enter a game is extensive and overstrenuius. There are pleanty more things wrong with this including hidden fees with cables (not included in package) the games and routers (Which I needed). I spent in total around $200 in high hopes of playing online. Instead I had the enjoyment of staring into the menu screen of the PS2. If your smart you'll spend your money on something else you want instead of this POS. By any means necessary stay away from this product!!\n",
      "This game is the absolute worst Pirate game ever. It completely lacks the fun factor of Sid Meiers Pirates!, or the polish of any many of the top quality games. This is headed for the bargin bin soon.It has typical Bethesda Softworks graphics bugs and other game crashing bugs. Ship control is horrid. Game play is non-existent. The interface is a cludge.  The sound is good and the graphics are &quot;ok&quot;.  Brilliant in spots, and simply ugly in others.  There are quite a few graphics bugs.  Even with patch 1.06 (released 04/2001). No matter how well you pound an enemy ship, they will never strike.  You must board (almost impossible).  And then defeat the enemy captain in a duel.  This duel is limited to a couple of crude keyboard strokes.  And in the first 12+ I tried, I lost all 12+.  Oh what fun.  So I had the joy of reloading the start postion a dozen times and experimenting with several different  There is absolutely no game balance.  There is no way to scale down the difficulty level.  In about 75% of the opening games, I was attacked by 3 spanish ships (you always start with the Spanish as your enemy).  No matter how much of their sails you shoot out with chain shot, they remain always faster and more maneuverable then you.  Your ship has 3 cannons facing rearward for when you flee.  I used those liberally for hours (real time) and was in the end caught and killed. (repeatedly).  This is a Simply STUPID way to begin the game. If you simply must own all sailing or pirate games get it.  I tried to give it to a buddy I went to college with, and after trying it he gave back.  Even free, it was over priced.\n",
      "I bought this game based on the enthusiastic reviews below, and now I have to wonder what these people were thinking.  &quot;Sea Dogs&quot; is indeed 3 games in one.  However, none of them is particularly complelling.  They consist of:1.  A roleplaying game, which consists of walking around and asking people things.  However you generally ask each person one thing, and they give you one response, so there's not much room for thinking.2.  A naval simulator, which is mildly interesting for the first couple of fights.  However, since every fight is basically the same, this quickly becomes boring-- endlessly sailing in circles and lining up broadsides against your opponents.3.  A video game style fencing sequence that is simply annoying.  It's ridiculously primitive compared to the martial arts style games on the market, and one has to wonder why it's even in here.Over all, there was nothing particularly compelling about the game play.  The graphics are pretty, but how long can you stare at the waves and the storm clouds when the game itself is dry as toast?  Also, the game is SERIOUSLY buggy, even with the new 1.4 patch installed and running.  The game is completely incompatible with a number of video cards.  So if you do buy the game, there's a modest chance that it simply won't run on your machine.\n",
      "I just wanted a fun game, didn't have to be high tech, yet I was VERY let down with the game.I first of all went to the OPTIONS section to select beginner, as was advised by a supposed experienced player on Amazon, well there was NO OPTION to select beginner, or any other skill level.All the hype and info sites , these persons must have worked for Bethesda, the game maker, because the game does not perform as advertised.The cheat codes do not work, unless you need a patch, and the start ship, a Pink, just gets sunk by 3 Spanish Galleons or Pirates from the start, so you do not have a chance to build up money to upgrade your ship or frankly to continue playing at all...your just dead in the water.There are no Treasure Galleons to capture, and only one pirate map at the end of a quest....Several efforts at making the game work for any length of time failed for the same game flaw of being attacked,( overpowering attacks by Spaniards or Pirates )All in all its very lame.........  Maybe the game would be better labeled... An Example Of The Worst Game A Company Can Make !!!!!!It wins First Place for the WORST PIRATE / TRADER game since computer games were developed..Thanks Bethesda !I could only give one STAR to reflect my opinion, but I would have given it a NEG. 10 STAR if possible.So life goes on, look for another Pirate/Trader game in the future.\n",
      "First of all, why the HELL is this thing $15 dollars PLUS tax. I have PlayStation2, and I don't generally like it. I thought Microsoft was trying to steal your money, but now this PIECE OF GARBAGE comes along and it is a JOKE. Why is Amazon selling this for $15 dollars. i got mine with my PlayStation2 and now they are selling it just to keep space. This is a total joke...........Now that I have cooled down, this can be space saving. If it was free, well, it would be a good buy. PlayStation2 is not THAT big, and if you don't have enough space 1)Your poor and can only put everything in one room or 2)You have those TV's which have a million plugs. That is why it gets at least two stars, because nothing is THAT bad, (well...some games and equipment have gone over the edge).So, instead of wasting $15 dollars, go out and save up for some games. The blue color is not impressive, and it doesn't cool down and it doesn't scratch your discs. Actually, it only does one thing, wastes your money.\n",
      "Carma II was GREAT! I loved it! A great way to take out my aggressiveness at the end of a hard day! And nobody gets hurt! Carma 3 SUCKED! I'm not even going to be kind on this one. I was VERY disappointed with the entire game and trashed it within a half hour after installing it.\n",
      "A friend of mine has this game. i found it really annoying and frustrating. It's to difficult to play. i couldn't even get past the first level. i recommend borrowing it from someone who owns it or rent it somehow instead of buying it.\n",
      "I was unable to get past the frustrating \"Parappa\" style first level so I can't recommend this game.  After 20 minutes of not getting anywhere, I gave up and threw it away.  (And I was able to beat \"Parappa\" so I know I'm not totally inept at this sort of game.)  There's no difficulty option, nor is there a way to skip levels.  Don't waste your time.\n",
      "I haven't purchased this yet but this review can still be EXTREMELY helpful.I was Playing my PS2 on my 56 tv and I said to myself..wow.  that quality ....  I went on to amazon because I had heard about these new cables that improved quality.  I found one (this one) and it looked great!  I hurried back to my Sony receiver (It connects up my DVD player, TV and surround sound system) and looked at the back.  No S-Video.  I got a flash light and searched it over again, hoping I missed it.  No signs.  I moved my tv over so I could look at the back.  WHAT!  There I see them, 2 s-video imputs. That makes me mad.  How could monster assume that everybody is going to be playing this on their TV?  Dont they realize that some people use home theater receivers!?  NOOO!  Theres no way I'm giving up my great surround sound for this.  If you want to buy this, I would check your receiver first.  If you dont have component cables, (which I DONT!! THEY ALSO ARE ONLY ON THE TV) or S-video on your receiver, I would suggest getting a 200 regular AV cable from Monster.  That one still improves quality quite a bit.\n",
      "A friend gave me this pad before considering throwing it in the trash. After two days of having it, >I&lt; threw it in the trash. The D-pad has got to be the worst thing about it, its a D-pad that wants to be an analog stick. So its never fast enough on oldskool games because of all its \"give.\" It has the right ammount of buttons (Start, Select, L & R) but that D-pad is soooo hoakie. I'd rather have an old Turbo Touch 360's flat touch panel from my Nintendo days. Atleast those actually worked. If you want console quality but on your PC, don't bother with flimsy copycat PC gamepads because they ALL suck. Get a Lik-Sang adapter and you can use PS1&2 pads on your PC! Download Joy2Key and you'll have awesome Keyboard and Mouse mapping software just like any Saitek or Logitech pad.\n",
      "Although it has 10 workable buttons which come in handy for some games, it has some major flaws. On some games, if you press Up on the gamepad you go Down, and when you press Down you'll go up. The directional pad is totally useless, games where you need to move the D-pad rapidly, forget about it!! The buttons in the back eventually get stuck. You can't use any other Gravis controller while this one is in use. And on top of all that, not even the uninstaller works right. When you goto uninstall the controller, it screws up your computers registry files. It was a nightmare just to get my computer working again. I'll never buy another Gravis gamepad again.\n",

They shouldn't be overcharging in this economy ;)\n",
      "And I give them one star for trying.The game really does LOOK good. And it seems like it would be a great game. But it is, at this point, almost completely unplayable.If you buy this game before they fix it (which could be months from now), here's what to expect: lag (VERY often) that can last longer than a minute, crashing to the desktop at least once an hour, computer lockups at least once every few hours, occasional inability to log in at all, items which do not work, missions which do not work, character death due to lag, and countless other minor and major bugs.I was actually very patient with these problems until the publisher lied to its customers. First, they told everyone the &quot;free month&quot; (your purchase price includes one month of online play) would not begin until the game was playable. Then, six days later, with almost no changes to the game, they declared it playable and began the billing cycle.To make matters worse, I can't even cancel my account. I'll probably have to dispute the charge with my bank. But at least I've already returned the game.Maybe I'll try again in a few months, but I don't really have a whole lot of faith or trust in Funcom right now.\n",
      "I will never EVER buy a product from funcom EVER again.This is the WORST developed game I have ever played. It devlievered on nothing it promised. It had horrible crashes for at least 2 months and now they reintroduced even more problems.Worst of all they have NO customer service. Something goes wrong with your game? Tough! Wait for a patch. No quick fixes and completely moderated forums so you can't even voice your complaints anymore!I canceled my account and I urge you to never EVER buy this game. That also includes any funcom game including their upcoming MMORPG.\n",
      "What is interesting about Anarchy Online is how much potential this game had. Great Graphics, a solid story line, and promises that players would be able to alter the course of the game's storyline all added up to an incredible dream for many gamers. The problem is, the game failed to deliver in most areas BESIDES graphics, leaving us with just another &quot;interesting for a week&quot; piece of software that will be popular only until the &quot;Next Big MMORPG&quot; comes around. If you like running out in a big field, clicking on a monster, killing it, clicking on another monster, killing it, clicking on another monster, etc, etc, etc... then this game is for you. If you're looking for an engrossing RPG, look somewhere else.One more important note: This game DOES contain &quot;easter egg&quot; nudity - that is, in certain extremely rare situations, you are able to see the genitals of some of the &quot;avatars&quot; in the game.\n",
      "I honestly wanted to give Anarchy Online a chance. The massively multiplayer genre needs some new blood, and there were some interesting things in this game when it first went live: good graphics, promising character classes, and a sci-fi setting (though really not very 'hard' sci-fi, more like fantasy with some 'futuristic' touches).However, the developer, Funcom, has demonstrated truly astonishing incompetence and bad faith since the launch of the game. All games of this kind have rocky launches, but don't be fooled: the problems of Anarchy Online go far deeper than a rocky launch. Each patch has actually introduced serious new balance problems and several, including the most recent patch, have reintroduced old bugs and added some new ones. These are not just garden-variety bugs, but game-stopping ones, mind you.Now Funcom has taken the extraordinary step of shutting down the support bulletin boards at its own site, which is always a sign of imminent disaster in the gaming world. It's the equivalent of a toxically bad film that a movie studio tries to keep away from critics hoping that they can just get one weekend of good box office before the word gets out.AO's European launch is imminent. If our good friends in Europe have any sense, they'll give this game a wide berth, whatever its price. The sooner Funcom closes the lights on the few remaining players in this flaming wreck of a game, the better. Perhaps they can sell the remnants of their tattered code to a real developer and someday we'll see the game reach its potential. It's a certainty that Funcom itself can't pull it off.\n",
      "Review - Anarchy OnlineI am currently a member of the Beta community for Anarchy Online. For weeks now many of the community members have spent hours upon hours trying to solve countless unaddressed problems that FunCom are ignoring. To sum it up. Anarchy Online is an advanced and very graphical RPG, if you can get it to work.  I personally believe that no self respecting programmer out there that would launch a game in a state like this. If you want to buy it, wait a few months.\n",
      "I was in the beta...well...I never actually played in the beta because I could never get the game to work.  Then I was dumb enough to buy the game...lol.  After about a week of hair pulling, countless crashes to desktop, a few re installs, I actually got into the game and played..for about 10 minutes at a time or until I zoned and crashed to desktop.  But these problems are covered in other reviews, let's get to the real problems.1.  BORING:  Once you get past all the bugs, (if you can), you find out what the game is really all about.  Well...not much.  One of the main selling points for this game, is that camping would be eliminated by the &quot;random missions generators&quot;.  The key word here is RANDOM.  Everything about this game is random and generic, and that's it's biggest downfall.  There is no sense of purpose, no sense of direction, and no sense of accomplishment.The missions all start to look the same after about the 10th one, and you'll be on hundreds of them if you ever want any cash.  This also ties in to the lack of boss mobs, and lack of dungeons.You fight mostly outdoors, or in the &quot;missions&quot;.  Which are randomly generated &quot;dungeons&quot;.  The implementation of which is absolutely horrible.  Mobs are spawned with no ryhme or reason, some dungeons have ZERO mobs in them, some have 5 that will all rush you at zone it.2.  SERIOUS coding and engine problems:  Not even going to go into all of these as they alone would take up the 1000 word limit on reviews, needless to say it's overwhelming.3.  Crashing, crashing, and more crashing:  Self explainatory.4.  Character creation:  Suppose to eliminate cookie cutter characters, but it doesn't.  Sure, you can train anything you want, but because of the skill system, and the way the points you get to spend must be distributed to make your character viable, you end up with really only one path you can take per given proffesion.5.  Monster AI:  The single WORST programming of AI I have ever seen in any video game...and that's saying a lot.6.  Exploits, cheats, hacks:  By the time I left, which was under one month into release, there were already players that were level 150+.  Being that this is a PvP game, that's not good.  Exploits were RAMPANT and numerous.  Exploiters went scott free.7.  Balance of proffesions:  Non existant.  The game is so unbalanced it's not even funny.  There are 2 viable classes to play if you want to live PvP, forget it if you play any of the others.Just a note about me.  I'm an avid gamer, and have 3 characters over 50 in EQ, and 4 over 50 in AC.  So I obviously have the patience for online gaming...lol.This game fails in every single aspect of gameplay.  It's boring, repetitive, buggy, unbalanced, and just plain no fun.  Avoid at all costs, you have been warned.\n",
      "broke after about of month of use and wont but another because of that.just becaise of the poor build quality\n",
      "This is a review of this product:Super Bust-A-Move (PlayStation 2 video game).  Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.(This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/04/2003)--------------------------------------------------I can't believe all the good reviews this game is getting. I just have to chime in with my opinion on this game.  Simply put, they broke Bust-A-Move. They removed almost all of the game play modes; they removed the edit mode; they made the controls unresponsive (they take a second to respond); they added annoying and distracting backgrounds; the bubbles have been graphically-enhanced so they they, too, are now annoying to look at; they took away all the cool characters and added a bunch of Pokemon rejects; and they added a TON of long loading screens.Most of that is pretty much self-explanatory, so I don't need to elaborate on it. However, I will give you a list of what few game play modes there are in the game:- 1 Player: Training / Normal / Classic- CPU Battle: Normal / Expert- 2 Player Battle: Normal / Expert / Chain ReactionYup, that's it.I rented this game to see if I had made a mistake buying Bust-A-Move 4 (for the Playstation 1). Well, I can tell you this, my purchase of Bust-A-Move 4 was definitely well worth it. I haveSuper Bust-A-Move 2on my rental list. Although I suspect that it won't be much better than this one, I'll still be optimistic and give it a try.If you want a good Bust-A-Move game to play on your Playstation 2, get yourselfBust-A-Move '99orBust-A-Move 4(both for the Playstation 1). Both are essentially the same, though 4 adds pulleys to the puzzles. Sure the graphics look like they came off of a SNES, but is that really such a bad thing?!? The load times are short (to non-existent at times), the characters look cool (in that odd-Japanese way), and most of all, the controls are extremely responsive and there are a ton of game play modes.\n",
      "Don't buy a ps2 just becuse it's style How can you know it's the best if you are one way minded what about dreamcast gamecub xbox  Is dreamcast dead hard to say when sonic aventrue 2 come out sega can't make enough  of it it's so good\n",
      "I've tried many times to play this game,and didn't get to even play it the first few times as it would just say that it's saving and would stay that way for an hour or more.Then I kept trying,and finally made it past certain points,but then the game screwed up again.So,I gave up on it.I am hoping that the seller wasn't being a snake and knew this game has a memory card glitch and still sold it.I wrote a review for this game a few days ago and I guess amazon wouldn't let me post for some reason.I was just trying to warn people of this game problem and possibly the seller I had ordered from.I didn't get very far in the game.Only a couple of missions before I have up!MAKE SURE THE ONE YOU'RE RECEIVING WORKS!Watch out for some sellers on here!I would return it,but I'd rather not waste MORE money.It's too bad I was really looking forward to playing this and this game had a different twist to the series which I liked....Oh well!\n",
      "I bought this game because people said its better than SSX.  Not true at all!  This game is nothing compared to SSX.  You should rent this before you buy it!  I am glad this game is so popular because I was able to sell it very easy and fast!!\n",
      "I bought this game because the sales charts revealed it was a top-seller... But now that I've played it, I can only assume that everyone else was as duped as I was. This game is terrible. The graphics, I will admit, are amazing, but the game play is just down-right uninnovated. You can't take shortcuts (even tho the box says &quot;careen off the dirt path&quot;) and the machinery isn't different enough.They did spend a lot of money on the music and instruction booklet, as the first includes tracks from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden and the later which is a full-color 49 page manual. But if you want a good off-road racing game, buy Rumble Racing.\n",
      "At first I was impressed with this sorry excuse for a game, but after playing it for a week, I win every time when I play against the computer.  But really what is the worst is that the AI of the game [stink].  It just is worthless.  So in a...attempt to make it more challenging, it cheats.  You ever charge 3 heavy calvary with 60 of your heavy calvary only to be beaten because the 3 heavy calvary you attacked just happened to have their daimyo?  Come on, how stupid is that?  There are a million bugs the game uses to get an advantage, which is a real shame, because the frustration it builds just does not make the game worth it. It is also a joy to get your troops stuck on the side of a mountain and it is just impossible to manuerver them anymore.  Never has a game had such potential just to [stink].\n",
      "I just could not get into this game.  I really liked Riven, but Myst III does not, in any way, compel me to keep on trying to solve the puzzles in order to get farther.  I solved the first major puzzle, which involved lining up reflecting lights in order of color to open a door on an island.  It took me a while, but I finally figured it out, and opened the door...only to find another puzzle preventing me from opening the NEXT door.  I mean, come on.  I guess I'm just not a big fan of puzzle games anymore, or something.  The story does NOT make me want to solve them, at any rate.  It's slow and sluggish, at least at first (I never got past the first part, because I was just too bored.)So, the eagerly-awaited Myst III: Exile is sitting on my desk, collecting dust.  I feel absolutely no urge to go play it, although I will give it one star for the pretty graphics.Buy this game only if you really, REALLY like thinking and solving almost-impossible puzzles.  Everyone I know who has this game was forced to buy the guide to go with it.\n",
      "The flower zone is too dull, in fact this whole game is dull, dull, dull. There is no story, and the puzzels are just plain stupid. Spend hours arranging reflectors. I don't think so.And let me tell you about the flower zone. First of all, the graphics rely on 'jumping' to the next point, so there is little pathway to follow, given that there is no 3d progress to take you to the next point of play. The screen jumps to your next location in even a more lazy way than Riddle of the Shinx did. Plus, once you have 'landed' at the next point in the 'jump', the stupid game has you turned off the point you 'landed at' so that you are looking cockeyed. I really hate how that happens...programmers, please place us facing the way we landed. I am not anal enough to want to figure out how I can go down a path and end up facing a direction I did not turn to face...I hated Schizm, but I think I hate this more. It is really a bad game. I have played many adventure games, but this is really lousy.\n",
      "I bought Myst III over one week ago. Until now, I have not been able to play this game at all. Here is why:After installation, the game needs CD-ROM disk 2 in order to start the game. However, after I loaded the appropriate disk, the program did not recognize that it was, in fact, in the drive and kept requesting it.I finally went to the Myst website for assistance. There, I found that Ubisoft &quot;is aware of the problem and for now recommends to the user to change the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive to 'something lower than H'&quot;. Added is a small, short note with a warning that &quot;changing the drive letter could cause other programs to not work correctly&quot;. It continues with &quot;...We are working on a better fix for the problem...&quot;. So of course I am not going to change my drive letters around - who knows what that will do to my system!While I am happy that Ubisoft apparently is aware of the problem, it bugs me immensely that they would throw such a game out on the market which obviously isn't up to today's systems. My CD-ROM drive is drive letter N, and I can honestly say that no game I have played in the past has ever had trouble recognizing it.I have now shelled out money for a game that sits on the shelf until Ubisoft comes up with that promised fix - inquiries about how long this will take were not answered to this day. I can only imagine how many more troubles are waiting for me once I'll get around the disk 2 problem.As to the game itself: I wish I could say something about it. I really do!\n",
      "Hi,When I first loaded this game I couldn't get past the title screen.  I e-mailed support and had no luck getting it to work.  Based on my negative review here on Amazon, Greg Uhler, one of the games producers, e-mailed me PERSONALLY to try to help.As it turns out, I e-mailed all my information and he gave me a solution right away!  Now the game runs great.I cannot thank Greg enough for his personal help!In case you would like to know what I did:I manually set my monitor resolution to 640x480 and 32-bit color.  That's all it took.  BTW I have a voodoo2 12MB, so if you have had any troubles try this!Rich Rossi-----------Old---------- As many of you know, this game had some serious support problems. I was never able to get it to work even though my computer exceeds all the system requirements. I talked to support, and recieved an answer and a follow up answer...then nothing. ....Now I am stuck with a game that will not run on a computer that it is advertized to work on. .... You have been warned.\n",
      "These games expect too much from you. What I mean by that is that everything has to be perfect in the city that you are building in order for the people who live there to be happy.You have to build their houses in a desirable location, otherwise the houses will be of poor quality and the people will move out. You have to make sure that the people have food, water, jobs, are healthy, have a source of entertainment, and have access to religious services. Providing these things for the people will cost money. If you run out of money, you have to find a way to make more money. One way to make more money is to establish a trade route to another area to trade your goods. This can be hard to do because you will have to find an area that will accept your goods and will trade them for other goods that are useful to you but that you can't produce yourself. You have to make sure that your city has a strong army of soldiers in case of an invasion. Even if you are confident that the people are happy, it seems like they will always have something to complain about. It seems like businesses always complain that they have too few employees. It seems like no matter how many firehouses and architects' posts you build, buildings will constantly be bursting into flame or falling to pieces. Your entire city that you have worked so hard on will be in ruins in just a matter of seconds even if you have the best fire and damage protection. And, you have to make sure that the gods are happy. You need to be constantly throwing festivals in their honor, otherwise they'll do things like send down plagues of locusts or what have you to wreck havoc in your city. What I'm trying to say is that these games are a little too hard. Also, the games have lots of typos, which can be annoying.These games belong in a 6th grade history classroom to teach kids how hard it was to rule one of these empires. I would not recommend these games to anyone, especially people who are easily frustrated. If you like city-building games, I would recommend Majesty, the Fantasy Kingdom Sim. Now that's a fun game.\n",
      "There is no sound. Graphics is very very bad. This game is too old to be played.\n",
      "I love &quot;Star Wars&quot; and related games! I recently bought &quot;Rebel Assault&quot; for the PC, and, frankly, it is an assault on my good taste as a gamer! I would rather play the original &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. This game is horrible and should have been removed from sale years ago. The graphics are poor and lack any finesse, the controls for the ships are slow and useless, the colors are gaudy, and, combined with the lack of definition caused by the poor, smugdy graphics, really hurt your eyes. &quot;Rebel Assault II&quot; has to be better than this. I wish I has that instead!\n",
      "Ok so i bought this from gamestop used for like 5 bucks.And im not gonna complain and say that i wasted my money or anything like that but this game isn't that great.Sure i played it for awhile but it just got to boreing for me.I'm not gonna explain what you do or what its all about but i will tell you that the gameplay pretty much sucks especialy if your the type that likes free roam games.There are these mini games or whatever you wonna call them i gues to train your character or something i dont really know i didn't play it long enough.Well anyway the bottom line you should really really try before you buy.\n",
      "This thing is about as ergonomic as a prison bench. The ability to change it from a right handed controller to a left handed one seems like a good idea, but it came with too high a price. -Four of the control buttons are located directly in front of the stick, hard to reach anyway, but they're only about a mile away from the throttle control; useless for those `I gotta hit this button now or I will die' moments every gamer faces. Because once you move your fingers from the throttle waaaaayyy down to the f1-f4 buttons, its all over. They did this, logically, to save the expense of having to place opposite, mirroring buttons beneath both the right and left throttle ports.Speaking of throttle....the wheel based throttle control has about 45 degrees of travel between zero and maximum, way too much for comfort. It forces the user to stretch out the arm too far, which, over hours of gameplay can really become uncomfortable.The stick itself: No doubt you've noticed from the pictures, there's this strange looking protrusion from the back of the stick? `What could this be?' One ponders upon first glance. Well, I shall not keep you in suspense....This little plastic protrusion is an incredibly intelligent and novel idea gone sadly awry. The upright `u' shaped piece is designed to nicely support your hand, the big muscle beneath you thumb sits atop it, while the flat portion of this device supports the edge of your hand. It's a great idea executed poorly.  Because of its placement, your hand always ends up coming away from the most comfortable resting position in favor of better stick control.  It would work very well, if the human body did not have shoulders, that is.  This resting point can be moved up and down according to you preference, but it's just another feature I found completely useless-it stayed where it was when I took it out of the box ...All this thick quagmire of discomfort results in one thing- sore wrists and elbows.The trigger is pretty nice, performs well and is, unfortunately, the most functional thing about this controller.  There are three buttons atop the sticks head, they're very easy to hit, in fact, too easy to hit. Often the user will find themselves executing commands because they've accidentally hit one or more of these buttons. Like most controllers, there is an eight way point of view or `hat' switch up top too. -It works, but it too is much too sensitive due to the length of its design, which gives your finger too much leverage on it and makes it very easy to press sideways when you wanted to press upwards.The customizable features of this controller make it unique; It's a fantastically intelligent idea.  Too bad Saitek didn't do some research and development utilizing HUMAN hands.  The head has three positions: Straight up, angled left, and angled right. I found it to be absolutely, positively, useless. -It stayed straight for my gaming needs; the angled positions just made it easier to accidentally hit the three buttons up top. Not something this controller needs.  There are also three up and down angle positions, which is nice, because you never know when you might want to put the top control buttons as far away as possible so you can place your hand in slightly different uncomfortable position to even out the aches in your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. I mean, hey, why not make your thumb uncomfortable too? Just to be consistent.Overall construction isn't terrible: It won't fall apart if you drop it. But if you're buying this for your teenager or tend to destroy controllers yourself, look for something a little more substantial. Even the base is lightweight plastic.Now that I've said everything bad about this controller, how about some of the good: The handling of the stick is very good. There is a nice spring at the base of the stick, making excellent, consistent resistance....which translates to good in-game control.  The spring also is responsible for returning the stick to center, and it does a dang fine job of it. Twist control, too, is very responsive, and it returns to center very well, which means your gaming screen only rolls or twists when you want it too. ...The only other good thing I can think of about this controller is...um...well...it looks cool, doesn't it?To summarize things: This controller incorporates some very novel, intelligent ideas but executes them about as well as an albatross makes a landing.\n",
      "This game is not worth your money.  Seriously.  Consider buying another ps2 game or even 2 dvds.  You are almost sure to get a better movie/gaming experience somewhere else.  Let me tell you about the game.  It takes 4 hours to work your way through the first time... but actual gameplay is only 1.5 hours.  The sad thing is, you wont want it to be longer.  The repetitive nature of the game is just awful.  Seriously, this game is not nearly as entertaining as double dragon on the super nintendo.  You basically take your wooden, stiff character into fights against even less natural opponents and kick butt.  This would be fine, but it just goes on and on, and without any real special skill or matters of interest.  The graphics are great and the story is only half bad (which for a game is fine), but seriously the gameplay is horrid.  Ill give it a star for the graphics but that is IT.  Save your money.  You would be MUCH better off purchasing DOA: Hardcore or Tekken or even zone of enders.  Do not buy.\n",
      "The Bouncer has been one of the most anticipated games for the PS2, and it being a Square title, you'd figure that it's well worth the wait...but dear sweet lord, it's not.  It's actually the worst excuse for a game that I've played in years, and Square should be ashamed of even putting this thing up for sale.Basically, The Bouncer is a fighting game with hardly any actual combat...just loads and loads of cinemas.  It's mostly a non-interactive, interactive movie, with a terrible story (something about a girl getting kidnapped by some mega-corporation with evil schemes), uninteresting and under-developed characters, and an awful game engine.  This thing seems to have been created as an show-off vehicle for Square's art department, and it seems to be little more than self-indulgent demo.  If you skip the skads of cinematics, you can breeze through this game in under an hour (!!!!!!) and once you've beaten it, you're supposed to go back and play with other characters to unlock more hidden features, but once is waaaaaaay more than enough.  Combat consists of hitting a few buttons over and over, with little strategy involving moves, because once you gain one decent attack, you'll pretty much stick with that one time after time.  The combat sequences aren't even that long, and you'll be watching two or three cinemas longer than the actual battle once you've beaten a level, which is completely absurd.  If you're looking to play one of the worst &quot;games&quot; released this year, then RENT but do not buy The Bouncer.\n",
      "The only good think I have to say about this game is that is does look really good! The graphics are great but that's the only great think about this game! I am totally disappointed with what they did to this game vs. what they could have done!If you are expecting to see a \"double dragon\" kind of 2 players with out a split screen type of fighting then think again. Next to that, you get the cheesy characters with the same ole cheesy names and cheesy story line! If you like story based fighting/action games that are very poorly thought out then you will like this one! Other wise, rent it, play it 2 or 3 times and then promptly return it and count yourself lucky you didn't waste your money on this stink bomb of a game!\n",
      "Boot-up of SquareSoft's The Bouncer shows that even a few short months after the Playstation 2 has become available, developers are making games that look great, meaning that even more great looking games are yet to come. Unfortunately, The Bouncer looks amazing, but that's mainly what you do in this \"game\" &#8212; look.The graphics, both foreground and background are completely amazing. The character designs are first-rate, with details adding to the realism, like the wisps of hair that bounce around on Sion's head, to the spiked horns sprouting from Volt's head. The emotions revealed through facial expression are great, but I really felt that I was watching a movie, rather than a PS2 game.Intros ranged from a few seconds to several minutes. They were great to watch, but as the game progressed, they became longer while the parts where having a controller in-hand became shorter.When the controller was in-hand, fighting enemies, the fighting isn't much ahead of Final Fight, or even as far back as the Double Dragon series. While you did have the incentive of beating them to see some more breath-taking scenes, the more you play, the less you want to watch, or even play.Additionally, the camera angles often were pretty bad, with you running toward the camera, making it impossible to see where the enemies were up ahead. There were also times in the subway scene, where you're running aimlessly to keep ahead of the closing doors and out of the times I did, it never got caught once. There was little challenge here. I think they were included so they could add more time to what was actually interactive on this title.Even though the fights are few and far between, it still gets old pretty quick.Had I bought this one, I'd be sorely disappointed, because a DVD action movie has a cheaper price tag. SquareSoft incorporated Dolby Digital 5.1 sound during the cinematic scenes and it sounds wonderful, but again, the Matrix is cheaper and more entertaining.The game isn't even that challenging. I've beat the game with one character within a couple hours of booting it up and am working through with another, but the storyline really doesn't change enough (there are parts, but it's just not enough) for this one to be worth much more than a couple hours of play. The local used game store had several copies of it, and now I see why. There's little replay value in this one.The Bouncer really makes a good showoff piece for the PS2, but SquareSoft forgot about putting some game in there. If the cut scenes had ended up having more actual game play in between, it'd be a must-have for the PS2 collection, but as it is, it's a maybe-rent. (...)\n",
      "This game looks fantastic.  It's visually stunning and works the PS2's capabilities to a great extent.  The sound and cinematics are nice too....but that's about where the fun stops.  This is a brawling game where you get to pick one of three fighters in single-player mode.  The controls are limited and clumsy (but the buttons are pressure sensative, which is kind of cool).  There's not much in the way of skill here...mash mash mash, you know?I was excited about this game, but got instantly bored when I played it for the first time.  Thank goodness there's a return policy at Babbages.Don't buy this one.  It's short and boring..and pretty slow.  Not good for a fighter/brawler.\n",
      "Wow, where to begin.  I popped this game into my PS2 after several months of Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001.  I had forgotten how crappy the Triple Play series had declined to, but was almost immediately reminded in full as all the bad memories came back.  I had to force myself to finish a season last year with TP 2001.  I finished 1st with 116 wins (only because I quit trying after the all-star break to try and make it a little more competitive).  I had 95 homeruns and 196 RBI's with a player I created.  I could mention the errors in TP 2001 all day but won't because I am reviewing Triple Play for the PS2.  The graphics are a given, as is true with every PS2 game, so there's no need to goo goo ga ga over good graphics.  The gameplay is virtually UNCHANGED from the PS1 series!!!  I can't believe with today's technology, they couldn't produce a better product.  I haven't played the game very much because of terrible boredom, so some of my facts may be inaccurate, but I doubt it.  The baserunning still feels like you're playing T-ball in kindergarten.  If you hit a line drive to the wall in right-center, most of the time your runner only gets a single because he's too slow to make it to second.  Not to mention that the runner on first can be thrown out at third.... on a ball hit to the wall that should be a stand-up double for the hitter, and should score the guy on first with no chance of a play at the plate!!!  Instead you end up with a guy on first and third and your next batter will likely ground into a double play to end the inning, which explains why you can have 3 runs on 25 hits when the game is over and batting averages over .700 for the season!!  The AI (Artificial Intelligence) is absulutely horrible.  Ex. The computer has a runner on second base.  The hitter hits a slow roller through the left side that escapes the SS.  It takes the outfielder 10 seconds to get to the ball, which has completely stopped rolling in the outfield, and the runner rounds third and goes back to third every time.  EVERY TIME!  The runner never scores from 2nd on a single.  The computer never steals bases.  The only time you ever get a triple is when the ball is misplayed and rolls to the wall.  Then you almost get thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple when it should be a stand-up.  At this point I was looking for a single sign that this game was improved from last year's PS1 version.  If there is an improvement, it's that you have to place the cursor on the ball when you bat.  That may help control batting averages a bit.  You can still get 3 or 4 hits in an inning and not score a run because of the horrible baserunning and double plays.  I almost forgot.  I was looking for a way to give me complete control over my baserunners and couldn't find one.  So every time I hit a ball to the wall and want to run for a double, the AI retreats my baserunner for me and I get one of the longest singles in baseball history.  There may be a way to change that but I haven't found it.  Nor will I because I'm probably not going to play it again.  The game still seems very choppy.  The player movements are still sub-par.  Ex.  You have 2 outs in the inning and you ground to the first baseman.  He snags the ground ball and quickly runs to first base, taps the bag, and jerks back into 1st base position without breaking stride.  He should be going to the dugout, the inning is over.  I haven't played to game enough to know if it still freezes with 2 outs in the 9th inning.  It probably does.  Ok, the commentary.  When are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that they've been saying for years.  The little stories that Buck Martinez tells over and over again during the same game.  The sound of the game blows too.  I use to play baseball and never did I hit the ball so hard that it sounded like a blast of dynamite.  Is this what EA Sports has to resort to to make thier product more interresting?  You also can't change settings in the beginning to turn the stupid soundtrack music off.  It plays the same verse over and over and over again.  You're ready to heave the game into the wall before you ever begin.  It's worse than the &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; of last year's.  At least Madden 2001 allows you to turn that crap off.  There are almost no options in this game.  You cannot customize your gameplay.  No franchise mode (not that I'd use it anyway), or customized level of play.  I could easily win 150 of 162 games with an all-star setting.  I think EA Sports has sunk it's ship with this one.  The only EA Sports titles even worth playing are Madden and NHL, and both of those have their problems.  Don't waste your money even renting this one.  I'd love to have my $6.35 back.  So far I'm not impressed with PS2 sports titles, but their day is coming.  3DO's High Heat Baseball 2001 for PS1 is by far the best Baseball Simulation I have ever played in terms of realism and gameplay.  Awesome.  I have heard great things about Akklaim's All-Star Baseball series for the N64.  I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of both, but if HH 2002 follows it's predecessor closely with a few minor changes, I will never need another baseball game.  As for EA Sports, sorry, but you need to get on it or get passed by your competition.  You no longer reign and your reputation is headed south.\n",
      "Now, I've played the later iterations of Phantasy Star, and I loved them. So I bought this to go with my shiny new Dreamcast, thinking I'd like this one as well. And I'm sure I would have...if it worked at all.Let me be the one to tell you, fellow shopper, because no one told me: to play this, you need a Dreamcast modem, which is quite frankly impossible to find anymore, a constant wired connection to a Sega server, and a special serial code, both of which do not exist anymore unless you want to go the hacking route and use cracked codes and private servers, one of which I'm fairly sure is still illegal and the other of which is time-consuming and requires lots of programming knowledge. In short, you can boot it up, and you can look at it, but there is nothing short of hacking that will allow you to play this. Do not buy, this is a collector piece ONLY, because it has ceased to be functional.\n",
      "I have no idea why this game is so highly recommended by so many.The graphics are dated,and I can't imagine why directx 8 is needed for this game.I tried very hard to enjoy it but I can't see what's there that's new or different.I hate the interface,and have found no way to see your stack or even your own character.In a first person view you should be able to see your other party members,decide who you like ,check out their skills and move them around in position,but not possible in this world.I haven't played the previous Wizadry games,and maybe if I had and come along with the story as computer technology progressed,I might find it more interesting,but I don't really think so.If you are looking for fast paced action,great graphics,and an engrossing story Don't look here.All in all, Wizardy 8's only wizardry seems to have been in the pr.1 star\n",
      "I guess if you spent the eighties playing Wizardry this game really does it for you.  For the rest of us it just doesn't cut it.  The graphics are straight out of 1992 and the control options are sad.  You're forced to pivot your POV around with keyboard keys like a tank turret which completely kills any feeling of suspense.  The character development within your party looked promising, but that's not enough to cary the dated game play.  I can't believe companies make games like this and put them on shelves next to modern titles and expect to make money.\n",
      "There are a number of people like myself experiencing a slowdown bug that makes the games all but unplayable. Every few seconds the game will pause for a 1/2 second or so! You might want to wait until a patch is released that fixes this annoying problem. Check the publisher's message boards for more info regarding this known annoyance. When I get this game working, I'm sure my rating will be 5 stars once i'm able to run this game as what i've seen and heard have been great.\n",
      "The first thing that comes to mind when a reviewer claims a game is terrible is probably \"oh yeah mister smarty pants, you better be able to back up why you think Mega Man X5 is such a bad game\".  I will try my best. :)First of all, the gameplay.  Being a Mega Man fan since 1993, I grew up with the original Dr. Wily *and* the X series.  I love both.  People constantly pick which one they think is better, but in the end, I always found shooting robots incredibly fun and I still find it rewarding and addicting to play through a Mega Man game over and over searching for the very best way to blast through a stage and eliminate the enemies, along with finding the best way to defeat the boss at the end of the stage.  Mega Man is mainly supposed to be a side-scroller shooter.  THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING (sorry, big words make it easier to get my point across).What does Mega Man X5 do?  It mostly abandons the need to really use your X-blaster for anything important, except for the stage bosses.  It makes me absolutely SICK TO MY STOMACH (sorry, the big words need to return) that Capcom chose to make at least half of the stages almost completely empty.  I don't know the name of the stage, but the forest level has almost NOTHING TO SHOOT.  You basically spend the entire time in this level just dash-jumping your way through, until you arrive to the end boss.  Oh okay, there are a couple things to shoot.  Lazily-designed and completely unmemorable bad guys are featured inside this forest stage (did I mention the backgrounds are bland-looking?)  When you arrive to these enemies (I think one of them is some kind of robotic plant, but I may be wrong) you actually have to wait a few seconds for them to shoot something uncreative and boring at you (which incidentally does very little damage).  Why am I WAITING for a slow-poke enemy to shoot something at me?  And in a MEGA MAN game, where speed and avoiding attacks is supposed to be the key to completing the game?  BORING!  Anyone who tries defending the stage enemies in this game is going to have an extremely tough time.I wish that forest stage was the only problem with Mega Man X5, but sadly it's just the beginning.  I can't stand this game.  I can't stand the fact that Capcom removed *every single thing* I love about the Mega Man series.  It's like the company has something personal against me.What to talk about next... okay, everybody hates the fact that the stage bosses are named after Guns 'N Roses band members.  This doesn't really bother me (even though I passionately hate Guns 'N Roses and think they are nothing but a sorry Aerosmith imitator rock band with a whiny, overrated lead singer).  I hate the fact that every stage boss can be defeated with *just* your X-buster.  Remember how important it was in past games to find the right weapon to successfully destroy the end boss?  Not now.  Each stage boss has ugly and lazy animations, and they move across the screen so slowly that it's very easy to just continue shooting at them with the X-buster while avoiding their lazy, slow attacks.  Believe it or not, all eight stage bosses can be defeated this way.  So much for strategy.  What a worthless game.Whenever Capcom tries to make a Mega Man game tell a good story, the gameplay suffers as a result.  This game is the biggest offender.  The worst part is that they removed the cutscenes you were introduced to in Mega Man X4.  Now you have to scroll through boring text as the characters have their boring conversations, building no suspense whatsoever during critical moments.  Lengthy and frequent text-scrolling is what X5 is all about.Oh, and let's not forget that Capcom just threw in a bunch of new friends to help guide Mega Man through the game.  I highly doubt anyone cares about these characters because Capcom just PUT them in the game and expected us to care about them without any kind of interesting history or connections to other Mega Man games.  Doesn't work that way.  Even if they were returning characters from the Wily series it wouldn't have bothered me.  The fact is, these new characters are a bunch of nobodys and even when you beat the game, they will remain nobodys.Speaking of characters guiding you through the game, your female friend Alia INSULTS YOUR INTELLIGENCE numerous times throughout the game.  While you dash and shoot your way through each of the eight unmemorable stages (that is, when you actually arrive to something worth shooting) she will CONSTANTLY appear on screen to bug you and tell you *exactly* what it is you have to do.  This means more inconvenient text-scrolling.  Sometimes she interferes with your progress so often that you just wish there was a way to shoot and kill her.  It's incredibly annoying.  After finding out how disappointing X5 turned out to be, the LAST thing you want to do is put up with someone like Alia basically calling you a moron.Alia insults your intelligence by telling you to do VERY simple things that anyone with ANY past experience with a Mega Man game would be able to understand without needing any pointless instructions.  She actually has the nerve to say things like \"jump over that wall\".  I THINK we already knew that.  Why?  BECAUSE WE'VE HAD TO DO THE SAME THING *MANY TIMES* IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR X GAMES AND *MANY TIMES* IN THE WILY GAMES.  WE'RE NOT DUMB!!!The challenge in each stage ranges from very easy to incredibly difficult, which is quite surprising to me because the challenge in past X games was a lot more consistent.  The already mentioned forest stage is worthlessly boring, but more specifically, a cakewalk.  However, the flipside to that are really frustrating stages that require excellent, fast-moving timing in order to complete. So throughout the game you will go from incredibly simple stages where you don't even have to shoot at anything, to incredibly difficult stages where you are sure to die many times until you get it perfectly right.  I LIKE FUN MEGA MAN GAMES.  Not this inconsistent mess.The game becomes almost excruciatingly difficult when you arrive to the very first stage in Sigma's castle.  The stage is ripped off completely from the Quick Man stage in Mega Man 2.  Remember jumping down and avoiding those laser beams?  Same thing.  In this game, trying to complete this task is MUCH harder.At least three stage themes are pretty good.  That's it.  That's the only thing Mega Man X5 has going for it.  Oh, and speaking of music, the theme in one stage is just an updated version of the water stage theme from Mega Man X2.  I especially hate this stage because it's one of those stages where the screen pushes you to the right, and you have no control over it.  You are forced to go with the flow while avoiding shots from a giant underwater robot.  So much for fast-pace shooting/dashing action.  I hate this underwater stage more than the previously mentioned forest stage.  At least with the forest stage I can go \"duh\" and daydream my way through the empty thing.  Stare at the ceiling while you play through the forest stage.  I bet you can make it to the end boss!Look, I love Capcom and think they're a wonderful company that does a fantastic job with action games, but they really screwed up with Mega Man X5.  Please avoid.  I can't be angry at a company that gave us so many good games, but when a game is rushed to the market and I believe no creativity or effort whatsoever was involved during the process of creating the game, it HAS to be mentioned.  That's what I did just now.  Told you why Mega Man X5 is so freakin' awful.  A lazy and unremarkable experience.  The game has no life.Every company has their bad games, and this is clearly \"the bad game\" from Capcom.  Just pick up Mega Man X4 to find out what a really good action game should be like.  I can only imagine what X6 must be like.\n",
      "I just received my Dracula 2 game from ... today.  That's the good news.  When you open the box the only thing inside is the jewel case which contains the two CD's and the worlds shortest &quot;manual&quot;.There appears to be no way to change the resolution settings, color settings, sound or anything else.  Or re-map the keyboard.  Keyboard?  There is nothing in the &quot;manual&quot; which shows keyboard assignments.  How do you move forward?  Who knows.  Backwards?  Run, walk or jump?  Who knows.  Want to use mouse invert?  Sorry about that.Having played PC games for a couple of years now I am conditioned to the fact that you're gonna get ... sometimes, and this is one of those times.

      "Welcome to the worlds most boring game.  When I ran this game for the first time I was very impressed with an introductory movie that was very long, detailed and creepy.  I couldn't wait to start playing to see more of that.  However, once I started playing I was dissappointed with this game and it's over-simplicity.There are only certain places that you can move to.  Want to go check out that dark corner over there?  Forget it, you can't.  You can turn around 360 degrees but only move in one direction, go figure.  You collect different items and solve different puzzles and that's all this game really is.  It's a pretty puzzle game.  There are no special effects and no movement by the monsters.  They just stand there and grunt at you.Not to mention this game is so pathetically easy that my four year old son could play it with no problems at all.Don't buy this game.  ....\n",
      "First I want to say that I am a huge baseball fan, and that WSB 2K1 was completely underrated and 2K2 is equally overrated. 2K1 had hands down the BEST GRAPHICS I've ever seen in a sports game. The pitching and batting of all players was right on the money, a perfect 10. Full motion, breaking pitches looked so sharp, you could even see the seams! While the fielding was automatic, the plays looked realistic and had full motion and extreme detail. The editor was fabulous too, although I wouldn't mind changing the height and weight too! It's wrong to call 2K1 a failure (an example of failure would be all 3 baseball games on PS2), because if only the fielding were changed to manual, that would have been the greatest game of all time. Meanwhile in 2K2, I lost hope. To start, the graphics aren't even close to 2K1, pitching and batting motion is strange, even cartoon like. Also, pitches don't break AT ALL- a fastball looks just like a screwball. Batting stances aren't correct (especially Bonds), and balls outside the strike zone are still strikes. To continue, yes, you have manual fielding, but a normal 6-4-3 double play is almost impossible, because it seems as though everyone is as fast as Maurice Green. Plus the fielders dive way too far, but at least they can jump. To add to that, the editor is [weak] too. You can't even change the faces, pitching stance, or batting stance, so it's all a clone team. Then to top that off, as the GM (who's suppose to have control) can't even trade half the people you want to because of NO TRADE contracts. That's poor. Hitting is far too difficult, and in 2 player mode, you can't even hide your pitch. The only pluses I can give are exceptional commentary, online play, and home run derby. This game needs much improvement.\n",
      "I did not enjoy the controls on this game.  The only entertaining part with the somewhat nudity that came with the game.  You know what they say, \"Sex sells.\"  Well if that was their only selling point then I won't hold my breath for the next one.  I would rather get a girlie mag for excitement.  Definatly not for kids.  I must say though, this is the first game I put down in one day.  I gave Batman and Robin a 3 day chance before I put that one down.\n",
      "This is a comic book.  With too much plot.  Endless pages of text dialog you must scroll through before getting to even a very short action sequence.  Even the action is dull and has too much dialog.  After a while, I quit reading and just kept pushing the buttons to get through the text and get to some action. If you're looking for action - look elsewhere.\n",
      "If you buy a game for graphics, then this is a game to buy.  However if you buy a game for game play then this is not the game for you.  Don't be fooled by other peoples reviews, well over half the game is movie, and I for one did not buy the playstation 2 to watch movies.  The entire game you just run from one movie to the next, never really doing anything except maybe picking up a key.  The problem solving is very simple as well, so simple in fact that it took me an afternoon to complete the game, my total time was like a little over 10 hours.  Save your money and don't buy this cheese fest of a game.\n",
      "I remember playing this game when I was very young at my brothers friends house, and I was addicted to it. I have fond memories of it and wanted to play it again, but good lord, how... how did I play this when I was little? Its very annoying. You can't save your progress, if memory serves right (I haven't played it in a while, though still have it), and it automatically saves as you progress through the game. Well, for me, I don't know what happened, I was at one part of the game, progressed, and then the timer kept running out before I could even walk anywhere and the character dies. So, this means I have to start the whole entire game over again, because each time I load my saved progress the a few seconds and boom, I'm dead. GRR!But, other than that, the plot is just plain amazing. If you've watched, and are a fan of the anime \"Full Metal Alchemist\", you'll probably love this. The main character is basically trying to defy his fate of death, trying to find out who it is who keeps trying to kill him. During your quest you'll find some ties to the scientific religion of alchemy, and meet a lovely woman who somehow becomes involved in this scheme. Every choice you make in the game determines the ending, if memory serves right there are 3 alternate endings(I wouldn't quote me on that). You must travel to different times, some quite distant! And defy your fate. I do adore the game, and the plot, but argh, its so frustrating!\n",
      "Snore fest.  Maybe this would have been fun in 1995, but here in 2009 this game is a bore.  You're limited to 3 weapons and this has a very 80's arcade feel to it, only even more lame.  This game is a wast of time and effort.  Pass on this one.\n",
      "This is the worst shooter game I have ever played. Weapons are pathetic, movement is akward, and aiming is purely painful. When I see the name KOIE on any other game I will certainly know not to by it. Seeing the 4 star average rating on this site makes me think that most of these reviews are bogus.( Has anyone ever seen a game with a poor rating on this site? I have not. This game diffenitly deserves a zero.) It disgusts me that there are games of this crappy nature allowed on the market. Give me a break.\n",
      "So get this, I play this game on normal the second to last level. Meaning one more and it was the final boss. I went through hell.The game has you go through really tough things, and really boring environments. The hard part of the game is really the backtracking. I never needed a strategy guide, but jeez man what is this. Once I got underground, I had to backtrack like 8 times.So the second to final level had me going under lasers again. After I narrowly got by the lasers, I had to go on a catwalk to a small room. There was no cover across the catwalk, and it was easy to die. I ran across for my life to the room which was to the right of the catwalk. Right when I step in the room a missle comes at me and I lose all of my health, and my place. I had to restart from before the lasers.The games mechanics are fine, the bots are boring though. The longer you play, the more times the nuclear bomb thingy goes off. It went off once during my whole time, and that was right before getting to the underground.The game itself is boring. I hated bactracking, and I hated how the enemies always had the upperhand. It was relatively easy somewhat, but powerups and life refills were hard to find, so alot of the time I was at low health, knee deep in baddies.Again, the backtracking is horrible. But also the lasers. My gosh, you have to avoid these lasers on a roof and at the second to last level. The lasers are HARD to get by. You have to do split second reactions.You can only save once a level is complete, so get ready to make commitments. You can't reload from continues so you better finish that level.Again, I hate this game for making the second to last level so hard. Honestly, keep the level of difficulty at medium. How hard is it to make the game easier. Koei decided to make all that time I spent worthless, o and there was no way to beat the guy with the rocket launcher unless I had thousands of health, or a cheat on. I will never cheat, so that is that.\n",

      "A great way to waste [...], or how about [...].  This game has little to no graphics, gameplay is nothing anyone should want, it lags all the time, even in story (hows that supposed to work, don't ask me), and the only good thing about it is that you can outfit your character.Cons:  Almost EverythingPros:  The Outfitter\n",
      "This is an absolutely horrible game.  The first thing you notice, though fairly trivial, is that the graphics are bad.  There's no changing the resolution or the color depth, so it runs at what appears to be 640x480 or something with a very low color depth.  Everything's grainy with banding due to lack of color.The next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible.  You move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape.  But, to turn, you either have to use the cursor keys (which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan, so it's hard to hold an image in your head of where you are), or you click and PUSH the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction (and the pan is so fast you can't see the scenery go by).  There's no cursor change in those cases.  Then, if you can look up or down, the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory.  Plus, the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where it's really pointing.  In some cases, clicking forward will turn you 45 degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you.  In other cases, you think it's pointing somewhere you've been, but it's not (so you miss a path).  You end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out what's going on.  Also irritating is that once you click to go forward, it will stop at multiple, non-significant spots (even on straight, non-divertable paths).  So, you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering what's so important that the game stopped you here.But, the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves.  The charitable description would be that they're impossibly hard.  A more accurate description is that there's neither rhyme nor reason to them.  In some cases, there's no indication that a device IS a puzzle and not just a static display.  If you don't have a necessary inventory item, you can't do anything and there's no indication that you could EVER do anything in it.  If you have some random inventory item that it expects, it just changes the cursor in the right place (if you happen to cross the spot) and you drop it on.  In others, the puzzle is so vague that you're not even sure what you're supposed to be doing with it or why.  Then you have to work your way through multiple, non-easily-written notation systems or phonetics.  In my case, I uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard, non-phonetically-writeable, background-noise-filled, alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large room.Impossible.  Not fun in the least.  Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this game.\n",

      "EU is heartbreakingly close to being one of the best computer games ever produced. Economics, religion, warfare, diplomacy, and exploration have never been so successfully integrated. As several people have pointed out, however, the manual and tutorial are woefully inadequate for such a complex game. You'll find yourself learning this game largely by blind trial and error. But I could live with that, given this game's many other terrific features. The thing that destroyed my interest in EU is the fact that this game cheats OUTRAGEOUSLY in combat. It is not uncommon to lose battles even when you outnumber the AI's forces by 10:1 or more. You can spend game-decades building up your armies and planning campaigns, only to watch your entire empire's armed forces get brutalized by inferior numbers of inferior troops. As long as you never fight another major power you're fine, but should you become involved in a war with another power, expect to do a lot of save-and-restore-ing to counter-act the senseless combat resolution. In my opinion, the game is not playable in its current state.\n",

      "One of the first things you do when you begin serious development of a general-market software product: consider the system configurations that it could work with and make it compatible with as many of those as possible without sacrificing tons of features.That isn't how Microsoft did things though when creating the Train Simulator software.This product just won't run on my relatively new PC -- which was designed for high performance gaming.  Even after repeated attempts to work with Microsoft Support, no luck.And after hearing and reading several other users' difficulties, I'm convinced that Microsoft made some basic mistakes on the development of this product.Despite their claims to have designed this for a wider audience than the hardcore gamer, Microsoft has released a product that does require more configuration twiddling than should be performed when installing a PC game.And purchase of a new video or sound card shouldn't be a requirement for getting a product like this to work either.It is a shame too.  Because this simulator seems to have so much to offer.I was really hoping to have hours of fun with this...but I'll have to wait for a more robust product from someone else.\n",

I attempted 2 installations with this software, and my computer has not been the same since.  I strongly urge anyone to wait for a few versions to come before paying for Train Simulator.

It's an excruciatingly slow game to get through, not because it's hard, but because it takes forever to get from point A to point B and then you have to listen to some awful dialogue for a while.  The puzzle I had the most problem with in the game was the one where you had to light torches in a dark tunnel.  You can't go on to the next stretch of tunnel until you light the torch in that area, and it's impossible to see anything.  I was reduced to searching the screen with my cursor until I could find a spot where the game would allow me to use my matches.  It wasn't hard to figure out what I had to do, but actually doing it was another matter.  Save youself the frusteration and boredom and buy some other game.  Whatever else you might get, it'll probably be better than this game.  If it's worse, you have my sympathy.\n",

So save your money and go buy a good game for the same price like Final Fantasy X.\n",
      "This game is the pits! Its the worst Mario game ever. Even worse than Mario 64.Pros: Nice GraphicsCons: Makes you madder than the Mad Hatter!Terrible GameplayToo hard\n",

      "The original GBA is an eye-killer because its screen is so dark.  Even though the LCD is active-matrix, you can't see much even under the best lighting conditions.  Get the new SP edition instead; it has built-in frontlight.\n",
      "I bought this a few years ago because I sold myGame Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Editionsince I bought aNintendo DS Lite Onyx Blackand later came across some of my old GB Color and Black and White games I thought I lost in a move. This is crap compared to aGame Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Editionsystem (or any GBA SP). The screen is so dark on this original GBA System, I have to shine several lights on it to see the screen and sometimes the glare of the lights makes it even more difficult to see the screen. Just stick with a DS or an GBASP system to play GBA Games.\n",
      "There is absolutely NO POINT buying a GBA. Its the same thing as a Game Boy only the thing is shaped different. 32-bit?. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this....\n",
      "This is the third official version of F-Zero. There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2, but there are only three games in the series, F-Zero (SNES), F-Zero X (N64), & F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (GBA). F-Zero is a relatively simple concept... it is all about a space race. Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers. You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph. Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete. Once you are on the track, anything goes. Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death.I was rather pleased with the feel of the game. The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA.  Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing.  The cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version. The vehicles have a new take on appearance. These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine, however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen.  The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine.I was disappointed with the actual control of the game. Racing is very difficult to control. It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall. This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place. The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy. By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track, you have already passed your chance to recharge. There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world.I did not like the game. I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games, F-Zero X more than the original. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward. I do not recommend this to newbies of the series. If you have played previous installments, you may find value here, but as for myself, once tossed around, twice shy.\n",
      "i don't want to waste too much time on this crappy game...  it's just not good at all, and it's pretty funny how everyone keeps saying it's good just because other people and game review sites say it is.  maybe it's because this game was made years ago, before better games came along.  whatever.  nothing sets this game apart as fun or special, be it graphics or gameplay or story.\n",
      "I'll be frank. I purchased this game because it was cheap and I miss the old Doom shoot'em ups so I was feeling a bit nostalgic. But I must say that Red Faction is not a very good game. The graphics look like something from Super Nintendo, the controls will definitely get you wacked if the monkey enemies disquised as humans don't kill you first and the character voices! My god I though I was hearing people talk through a pillow being stuffed in their faces. Purely Awful!\n",
      "This game is a steaming pile of [...] that stepping in may cost you [...] (luckily it only cost me [...]).The Simpsons and Wrestling are two of the most popular shows on TV today and two of the few shows that i make sure to catch every episode of...every week. Now some marketing genius knows that the PSX is in dire need of a Simpsons title, but they know none of the Simpsons games made under the Acclaim license were really any good except for the immortal Simpsons Arcade game.They figure \"Hey, Simpsons, and Pro Wrestling, the kids will love it!\"The problem is, any kid in their right mind will not love this. As far as Pro Wrestling goes this is not it at all. Steaming burps, massive weapons coming out of nowhere, jumping 8 feet across a ring.The graphics are downright ugly. The characters look all wavy and messed up. They tried to make a 3D simpsons and wound up with a very 2D-ish cartoony game that wouldn't stand on 16 bit standards.The gameplay is not there, not there at all, button mashing on top of button mashing will not get anything to work in this game, if you rent this without a manual you'll be doubly confused.The sound is not as bad but not good at all, small voice sampling and really really unfunny clips, it's the actual TV show voices but they sound like they've been clipped from episodes and put together for the game.There is no replay value, because it stinks, it's pitiful.I rented this game and i want my [...] back on top of money for all the distress and punitive damages that this game has put upon me.May god have mercy on the souls of the people at Activision who made this stinker (This is the company that made Tony Hawk, Spiderman, and Vigilante 8?).The thing that really irks me is that some of the best games ever have been cartoony takes on sports. Like Punchout and Ready 2 Rumble for boxing fans and Mario Kart for racing fans, so on and so forth.However if you want a wrestling title for your playstation, i recommend Smackdown 2, THQ did a great job with everything except the graphics on it, and the arenas look good, it smacks of fun and replay value.If you want a good simpsons title, email the folks at Activision and tell them to make the Simpsons Racing game for GCN and PS2 not stink.\n",
      "22 Characters? More like 16. And It's not even wrestling, it's smacking each other around with pinning. Don't buy it, it'll only kill your love of the simpsons. It only got a star because the dialouges are funny.\n",
      "This game is nothing more then a mindless filler. A second-rate Smackdown vs. Raw ripoff. The story is stupid as heck. The garphics look like they were made by a drunk 4 year old. It's very gimmacky and cartoony to say the least. I give this game a 0 out of 10.\n",
      "I couldn't even get through the first level. The graphics aren't 3-D but that's okay because the colors are awesome. I don't like the levels and the powers you can get. It seems very boring for me to go around and punch cages and weird...bad guys. The levels are really bad and it's too hard. Not a good GBA game.\n",
      "I'll be quick and to the point...this game is NOT Final Fantasy!!!  Did I mention it's also bad?  The story, music, and gameplay is as flat as the cartrige it's made on! SaGa Frotier has been wildly praised as the worst Squaresoft game ever produced, and it's no wonder why! The only reason it came here as Final Fantasy is because they figured that's the only way it would sell! My advice: Skip this game!\n",
      "the final fantasy legend games are a perfect example of the gameboy's limits which makes the game unplayable for me save your money and buy final fantasy 4, 7, or 9.\n",
      "This is a quest through the jungles of South America, you are an explorer equipped with a short whip, a sling (slingshot), and a boomerang, against a jungle of animated snakes, spiders, deadly plants, quick sand, annoying monkeys and so on. The controls first of all are annoying having B as the jump button and A as the attack, L as the boomerang and R as the sling. Then next, the background graphics are so needlessly detailed, that you can hardly tell what is part of the level and what is part of the background! The animations are cartoonish and annoying, because its impossible to lets say do a small jump, the player will always takes huge leaps! The levels are very large and detailed, each has a different theme, but there are traps, where you can actually fall from the end of a level back to the beginning and have to do it all over again, making the game very tedious and frustrating! If you want a fun game, along this genre, take a look at the Gameboy Advance game, Lady Sia. Its also very unfortunate that I have given this game one star, because I have never given anything one star.\n",
      "The game looks good on paper, but it's very difficult to play.  The missions are pretty much all the same, and the controls are very difficult, and you can't really see your enemy even on the backlit screen of the GBA SP.  Avoid.\n",
      "This game was one of the sorriest game boy advance games I have purchased.  Its not the sorriest and that belongs to Metal Bots.\n",
      "Very simple building of a tetris castle.  Biggest challenge is determining what shape is falling after your castle gets higher and the piece is hidden behind the score.  Graphics are very simple, music also simple.  After an hour of playing you've seen it all.  Nearly all Atari 2600 games have more complexity and game play.  The L and R buttons are reversed, you push the R button to scroll to the left.\n",
      "Fortress is definitely an odd spin on the old Tetris formula. You start by dropping blocks to create a fortress. Instead of eliminating lines, as done in the classic Tetris, assembling a 3 by 2 grouping of 6 blocks will create a solid stone. After completing a predetermined amount of your &quot;Fortress&quot;,  you will be given a catapult piece. This piece will be used to attack your opponent's fortress.At first, the game appeared to be a Tetris clone. I started stacking blocks between two flag poles. This seemed rather easy to me until the flag poles started to move, then it got a little frustrating. After blocks started fusing together, I started to get the general idea. The enemy began firing at my fused blocks within the first minute of play. I realized at this point I probably should have read the manual before playing.The second time playing Fortress,  the point behind the game still eluded me.  Granted, I was now stacking blocks like a pro,  but this time, the bombardment still continued as scheduled.  No matter what I do, the game will not allow you to build a castle and completely defend it. I equate this game to building a sandcastle on the beach. Lets say you build it in the tide. Every time a wave comes along, it destroys a part of what you made, so therefore, you can never complete your castle. You keep doing this until frustration sets in and you quit all together.I do not recommend this game to anyone. Fortress is a poor attempt to modify the Tetris formula.  This game fails to entertain on any level. Unless you need a paper weight, skip this title.\n",
      "A little while back I bought this game at a store, for [$$$], because I thought it looked fun, and it seemed at the time to look alot like Worms: Armageddon, which I really enjoy. When I got home I hated to say that I wasted that money. This game is not appealing to me, although it may be fun to some who are tetris fans, since this somewhat resembles that,  but thats what I found odd, because I liked tetris,  but this made me yawn after 10 minutes of gameplay. There only few levels and you just have to make a large building and blast down your opponents building. You cannot even shoot when you want to. All that you do is stack and then lay back and watch the slow combat take place. Well, I hope I am not the only one who doesn't care for this game. I don't know what was on the creators mind when they were making this, but I don't think they succeeded in making a great game. One-star-rating is a little harsh, but,this just isn't a game for me....\n",
      "This game does not do any justice to Castlevania because the game's dark ambience is totally destroyed by GBA's poor screen.  Don't even think about playing the game under anything other than ideal lighting conditions.  You just won't be able to see much on the screen.  I was foolish enough to buy the game to play on my subway commute but boy, was it a true nightmare.The gameplay itself is classic.  You scroll to explore the environments, so it's very easy to play.  Konami should have lightened up the display and made the game GBA-friendly.  Then I would have given it a three-star or higher.\n",
      "Dragon Ball Z Budokai is horrible. The graphics are ok, but the gameplay is slow. I'm not a big Dragon Ball Z fan, but I do like good fighting games and this is not one of them. I would not recommend buying this game, if you are DBZ fan then you might want to rent it.\n",
      "I don't own this game. BUT - I've seen it played on a PS2 (I own an XBox). Overall, I was unimpressed. The graphics look old and the towns crackling with pixelation. Kind of like the games I was used to on our old computers...nothing compared to the smooth, defined glow of the graphics Burnout 3 has on Xbox. You start with total crap for a car, and are supposed to build up as you \"break into the underground\". Really, you go crawling around in your tank - it says you're going 120 but it looks like you're going 35. Honest, I could imagine one of the pedestrians grabbing a skateboard and keeping up with the cars!In Burnout 3, you literally rocket through the levels, flying at crazy speeds weaving in and out of traffic. Gets you excited. I watched someone drive their car in Midnight around for a while and about fell asleep...plus, no car damage, or not much. The old school \"shove others out of the way, my car's invincible\" gag.Maybe it's just me. Maybe Burnout 3 spoiled me, or I just have alternate tastes. But I don't get why so many gamers stand behind sub-par games. Silent Hill 4 was supposed to be good - CRAP. Halo 2, perhaps the biggest game ever, was hyped to the max - BOR RING. Maybe I'm just got particular tastes in games that I just have to realize, for I've been disappointed recently.Want good games, I suggest Burnout 3, Wolfenstein for a shooter (its okay) and Mortal Kombat Deception (bloody good fun). But I don't recommend this. Ugh.\n",
      "Sorry, don't buy this game! The idea of a cell shaded racre is cool, all the hype, the pictures and the new challenger to Gran tourismo are completely false. You have zero control of your car around corners, braking sends your car into some crazy wobble across the track until you slow down enough to go straight (with added SFX of something reminisent of opening the door to your home on a very windy day and not closing it right!)I was stupid - i bought it full price when it came out and hated it the second i got going. Music sucks, tracks suck, sound sucks - cars look cool but overall - IT SUCKS!Don't waste $1 let alone $50 on this heap of steaming stuff!!!\n",
      "this game sucks.  If you want a truly disturbing game play the 3 fatal frames on ps2\n",
      "Ok....a cutscene here and there, ok........a cutscene every freakin time you move, that goes on for 45 minutes is NOT fun.  My save game is clocked at 19 hours, and I'm sure I only played about 3 or 4 of those hours.  And when I was playing all I was doing was running around!!!!!!!!  How in god's name did you all give this game a 5??  You want a good game that's similart to this, Get shadow hearts (preferably 2) it's a THOUSAND times better.  After playing that, you'll wonder how the hell you EVER gave this 5 stars, therefore convincing me to buy this AWFUL game.I had more fun playing the Xenocard game than I did with the rest of it.  And even that I got bored with.\n",
      "I have been waiting for this title to come out for a long time, but sadly I'm disgusted with how this game plays and looks.  If I'm not mistaken this company is creating [edited].  If that's the case, it's not a good showing for what to expect.  The graphics on \"Shell Shock\" look a few years old, the movement of the character is slow and rough.  And the overall feel for the game is boring.  Compare this game to [edited] There's no comparisons.  This is a definite trade-in and title to forget.\n",
      "Ladies and gentlemen be warned. This game is a popular series that has --until this point-- been very enjoyable. But Treyarch has seriously lost their touch. Spiderman 2 starts out as a wonderful game, the ability to visit street level and foil \"everyday crimes\" around the city is awesome. But the \"level bosses\" (fights that you must complete to move on) are terribly designed. One level (Mysterio's burning theatre) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed. Another level (Statue of Liberty) is so bad that you'll want to return the game. This game deserves no honors whatsoever, since the designers spent too much time trying to do \"cool\" things, rather than making it playable. Go back to the older Spiderman games and you'll enjoy yourself a lot more.\n",
      "Sonic 3D Blast is quite different from the 2D Sonic games on Genesis. Instead of running through zones to get to Eggman, Sonic has to rescue birds called Flickies from Eggman's robots to proceed. I'm fine with rescuing birds even if it is a bit strange (although the idea was also in Sonic Adventure). What I do not like about the game is how weak it is. The graphics are not in 3D at all, they are simply set at an 3/4 overhead view similar to Zelda and Super Mario RPG. They are good for the Genesis, but if you want to see better consider getting the Saturn version. The soundtrack is weak, repeats a lot, and normally does not fit the zones very well. Again, if you want an amazing musical score you should get the Saturn port. After the terrible music was muted I found the controls were VERY slippery. I tried it with the standard D-Pad and found it was almost impossible to change direction. Using a joystick is not much better. The controls, aside from not having a proper configuration, have bad traction. Along with the dreadful music and controls is the boss fights. Eggman has been and always will be a wimp, but he hardly is trying in 3D Blast. Normally it is the terrain that supplies the hazards while Eggman flys around shooting something at you.Honestly, I am a huge Sonic fan but I can not stand this game. If anything you should buy the Saturn version, or just play a real 3D game like Sonic Adventure.\n",
      "I don't like this game. The 1st one is better. This one sucks! I expect more from the blue sky team!\n",
      "Considering how much I've hated (and continue to hate) regular Mortal Kombat 3 since it was first released almost 12 years ago, it was only natural that I would also have a strong dislike for \"Ultimate\" Mortal Kombat 3. But, if you've never seen any of my other reviews for other Mortal Kombat games, here's why I really hate this game.- Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the beginning of the end for the series because THIS is the game that started the trend of having WAY TOO MANY unnecessary Mortal Kombat games on the market, making everyone who used to enjoy the series SICK TO DEATH of it.- The actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in Mortal Kombat 3. Which means, I hate it. It's like the company knew how much I hated the direction they took the Mortal Kombat series starting with the third installment, so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning. They did this on purpose to annoy ME. If the actual fighting stinks, it doesn't matter WHO returns. It's like Midway knew they made a mistake with the original Mortal Kombat 3 by introducing people to a list of all-new fighters, but they somehow DIDN'T realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason Mortal Kombat 3 was such an awful game in the first place.  So running around delivering combos is *still* here.  BAD move.- I hate when something is supposed to be the complete package, but instead, when you play the game, you find out that a bunch of things are missing. That's exactly what we have with this game. It's sort of like opening up a Christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside. Okay, the game isn't as bad as waking up Christmas morning and being insulted with an empty box, but still...It would be best to never even think about touching this game.\n",
      "You should have seen the look of disappointment on my face when I first played Mortal Kombat 3. I actually received the game a day before its official release. My dad's ex-girlfriend found a copy of it somewhere and bought it for me. While that was a nice, unexpected thing for her to do, I really don't like the game.I hate Mortal Kombat 3 not only because many of the classic fighters of the past aren't included, but for another MAJOR reason- the actual fighting sucks. I absolutely DESPISE the fact that combos have been added to the Mortal Kombat series. Nothing more irritating than doing really well in a fight ONLY for the computer to suddenly get this amazing burst of energy and charge at me with devastating combo after devastating combo. That right there ruins the game *completely*.Speaking of combos, actually being able to pull one off is almost impossible thanks to the way the game company designed the combo system. They made it so you have to press a BUNCH of buttons *exactly the right way* at *exactly the right time* or else the combo won't work. Yeah, I'll really have time to properly do THAT in the middle of a fight...The fatalities are horrible-looking. They look *really* cheap. The fatalities in Mortal Kombat 2 are graphic and bloody, but the ones in THIS game are terrible because they are so darn cheesy-looking. They aren't as violent as you'd expect them to be in a Mortal Kombat game. In fact, the amount of blood in the game went down *considerably*. A *little* wave of blood splashes from your opponents body when you punch or kick them, and I hate it *so much*. It's almost like a normal fighting game. If it didn't say \"Mortal Kombat\" on the box you wouldn't even know you were playing a Mortal Kombat game!I hate the fact that they modernized the levels so you can fight your opponent on the city streets with buildings and other normal-looking things in the background. I have news for you- EVERY fighting game features a city level. I thought the people behind Mortal Kombat were more creative than to copy what everyone ELSE is doing. I guess not.But the one thing that makes the game worthless in my opinion is the fact that there seems to be a bug in the game that makes the computer REALLY cheap-shot you after you win just ONE fight in the tournament. For instance, let's say you start a tournament with Liu Kang and you have the game on easy mode. You defeat your very first opponent in two straight rounds and move on to the next fight. No problem, right? Suddenly *for no reason at all* the next opponent will RIP YOU TO SHREDS with combos and other things, giving you NO TIME AT ALL to respond. You lose both rounds and have to do the fight again. Remember, this is on EASY mode.Let's say, you try it again with Liu Kang (or anyone you want). For some reason, NOW the fight is easy. NOW the computer isn't throwing combo after combo at you and NOW you can complete the fight without much of a problem. You beat your opponent in two simple rounds and move on to the next fighter. Guess what? The INSANE cheap-shotting has returned, and in a matter of seconds you die in two rounds. You're shocked and confused that the game has turned into INSANE mode. Time to hit the continue button. You pick Liu Kang as your playable character again... nah, let's make it Kabal this time. Guess what? The fight is BACK to easy. Your opponent is dead in two rounds.You can't understand why the tournament fighting bounces back and forth between easy and INSANELY difficult. After all, you put the game on easy, it SHOULD BE EASY! The next opponent you have to face... yup, you guessed it- nearly impossible to defeat him until you die and try it again!!Do you see the pattern here? After you beat an opponent easily in two rounds, the next fight will be *just the opposite* with you having to face an EXTREMELY challenging fighter, and most likely you will NOT be able to beat him. But the NEXT time you face him he *will* be easy! Do you see why the tournament is so frustrating?  You win, you die, you win, you die, and the tournament will keep going like this until eventually you run out of continues and therefore, die.  NO WAY can you put a positive spin on this.That's the dumbest and cheapest thing I've ever seen in a fighting game, and that's the main reason I hate Mortal Kombat 3 more than ANY other game. At the very least, when you enter a tournament on easy mode it should START off easy and *gradually* build to a challenge by the time the final opponent rolls around. Not any of this \"easy this fight, impossible the next fight\" crap.Avoid Mortal Kombat 3 forever.\n",
      "MK 1 and MK 2 were pure gold.  MK3 adds some cool characters but it totally sucks.  The AI makes this game nearly unbearable they are super nazi cheese kings that know your every move before you even do it and magically avoid your moves and counter everything in a quick and cheese bs fest manner that the player con not come close to doing.  The unfair level in this game makes it only fun playing two players.  The bosses are unfair cheese lords too.  This just sucks other than the new cyber ninja's nothing to care for here.\n",
      "The Saturn was a briefly popular 32-bit video game system created by Sega in the 90's.  It was designed to compete with the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64.  Unfortunately for Sega, the Saturn ranks a distant third in terms of enjoyment value.Looking back, I'd say the Sega Saturn really isn't that bad a system.  I used to play it with my friend and I'd say I had a *little* fun.  It's just that Sony was pumping out an *unbelievable* amount of excellent games during the EXACT time Sega was trying to market the Saturn and, as you know, Sony came out of nowhere and grabbed the attention of millions and millions of video game fans.  This made it VERY hard for Sega to keep up with the surprising success of the Playstation.  Sony wasn't fooling around back then- they were on a mission to dominate the video game market and BOY did they ever succeed.  It permanently changed the video game scene; destroying the console wars between Nintendo and Sega.  Sony coming out of nowhere and almost *immediately* ruling the market pretty much spelled the end of Nintendo and Sega being the only two video game companies competing with each other.  Now a THIRD company entered the mix.  To put it another way- Sony temporarily brought Nintendo to its knees and, in the process, knocked out Sega forever.  Sega was never able to recover from the damage Sony had done.  Everyone thought Nintendo would be the company to destroy Sega.  Nope!  Nintendo came close a few times, though.  With Sega's well-known history of bad marketing techniques, this might have been for the best.  I bet Sega would have continued to struggle if they had made the decision to keep themselves in the console-releasing market after the Dreamcast was finished.  I bet Sega would be looking pretty ugly right now, in terms of sales.  Good thing they pulled away.Because the Sega Saturn didn't have a long life, the few people out there who actually own one HAVE to notice its main weak point- not very many games to choose from.  The good Saturn games you CAN choose from are either really rare and expensive, or import games never released in America. That's the biggest problem with the Saturn.  Just not enough.To give Sega credit, the Saturn DOES have some quality games such as Virtua Fighter 2, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Shining Force III, Sonic Jam, Nights and Dracula X.  BUT- and here's the important thing I want you to remember- it would be IMPOSSIBLE to ignore the many crappy games released for the Saturn.  Worthless games such as Corpse Killer, Bug Too!, Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga, Hi-Octane, G-Vector and The House of the Dead don't exactly show off the Saturn's amazing capabilities.  Also keep in mind that the Sega Saturn was an *extremely* awful system when it came to sports games.  Just about every basketball and hockey game released for the system isn't worth a darn.  To me that's surprising when you consider the Sega Genesis was known at one point as the best video game system for sports games.  You'd think Sega would have continued the trend of releasing quality sports games for the Saturn, but they didn't.  Another disappointment.Everyone likes to point out that the Playstation is the video game system with the highest amount of crappy games.  That's only because Sega gave up halfway through the competition with the Playstation.  Argue with me if you must, but the Saturn was basically dead by the end of 1997.  The Playstation was just getting warmed up by that point.  If the Saturn had continued to compete with the Playstation until say, the year 2000, the Saturn probably would've ended up with JUST as many horrible games.  Sega gave up in 1997 when it finally dawned on them that Sony was putting them out of business.Mostly jealous Sega fanboys like to point out the high amount of terrible Playstation games, while Playstation fans correctly understand that you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the GOOD games- and believe me, the Playstation had a LOT of good games.  In fact, the best Playstation games are better than the best Saturn games, in my opinion.  Give me Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2 over Nights and Shining Force III ANY day.  It's a shame Sega fans will never stop defending the Saturn with the same old argument.  Time to give it a rest.In case you haven't noticed already, it bothers me that Sega fans don't seem to mind all the junk that was released for the Saturn and instead point out all the crappy games available for the Playstation.  That's like saying the mosquitos in Miami aren't NEARLY as bad as the ones in Tampa Bay.  Doesn't make much sense does it?  So why am I defending the Playstation's crappy games?  Because I find it a little bit inaccurate (and rude, to be honest) that Sega fans completely ignore the crappy games available for the Saturn and instead focus on the crappy games for the Playstation 1.  I just want to point out that yes, the Saturn DOES have its share of horrible games as well, despite what Sega fans would like you to believe.I think Sega fans are confused when they say overall, Saturn games feature less loading times than the Playstation.  For a supposedly powerful video game system, you sure had to wait a LONG time to play a game on the Saturn.  For example, you have to sit there for an eternity to play games like WWF: Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game and Mortal Kombat Trilogy.  Compare those loading times to the same games on the Playstation, and the wait isn't NEARLY as inconvenient.What makes the lengthy loading times on the Sega Saturn even MORE frustrating is how, right after the \"now loading\" screen goes away, the screen turns black for a few seconds making you wait even LONGER.  There's no 3-seconds of blackness on the Playstation.  The *very* second the loading screen goes away on ANY Playstation game, the actual game comes in.  Sega fans like to pretend those few additional seconds of loading aren't happening.  Trust me Sega fans, I DO notice them.  I DO realize that I'm waiting 3 extra unnecessary seconds to play the darn game.  The Saturn is MUCH worse when it comes to loading times.  It's SO slow.  None of this matters anyway, because by the end of 1997 loading times were almost completely gone anyway!  If only the Saturn had survived long enough to see that.Besides the loading problem, most of the time the Playstation had the superior version when the same game was released for both systems.  This was because the graphics were always clean and sparkly on the Playstation.  On the Saturn, after they finished creating a game it was like they rubbed the graphic engine in the dirt.  Either that, or the person who put the colors in all the Saturn games could only see in black and white.  All the bland, colorless backgrounds on most Saturn games make me feel like I'm digging a hole to China.  Poor, severely-dated graphics.  For a good example, compare the two versions of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  Once again, the Playstation version smears it.  The Saturn version features ugly, grainy and ugly-colored graphics.  If a game appears on both the Saturn and Playstation, compare the graphics and I guarantee the Playstation version will look better.I can think of only one thing the Saturn did better than Sony- the CD Player built into the system is actually more interesting on the Saturn.  On the Playstation it's just a boring, predictable layout of hitting \"Play\" \"Pause\" \"Forward\" etc.  On the Saturn you have a LOT more options, and the neat-looking background showing a countless amount of shooting stars is pretty impressive to watch while you sit back and listen to the music from the CD you put on.  None of this means the actual quality of the CD player on the Saturn is better- just that the outer space background and addition of more options makes it LOOK better.  They both play CD's very well.It's a shame the Saturn couldn't hang with the big boys.  It couldn't hang around long enough to see sequels to many popular games such as Resident Evil, Mega Man and Tomb Raider.  All those sequels went to the Playstation and turned out to be VERY successful.  If a game like Resident Evil 2 had appeared on the Saturn, who knows how successful it would have been.  Sony seriously put a hurtin' on Sega.Funny how the Playstation's gray-colored ordinary-looking system design is actually more attractive than the Saturn's silky-black \"cool\" color.  What's that expression?  Never judge a book by its cover.  Right!  I think back to that Sega commercial ten years ago showing a Playstation falling from a building and a guys voice saying \"fly, play thing, fly\".  hahahahahahahahaHAHAHA!!!\n",
      "Every time I order this product, the company sends me NBA Street the first one. I've ordered this game four times. I've given up on this game. Send it to HELL!\n",
      "Feeling like like making a mistake? Buy this game,then! Made its bad graphics,impossible passwords, and lack of fun will convince you what a mistake you made. Enjoy fighting crappy unpopular bosses like the Sewer King, the Hand ninja klan thing,Echo (easiest boss), and the first boss (harder than Kingpin)Elektra, who has suddenly, without any explanation, has sprung back to life. Fighting Bosses just depends on luck, no strategy. Enjoy your waste of money!!\n",
      "before i played the demo of this game,i thought it would be awesome,like a better version of rune from the ps2,but alas,i was sorely disapointed.I was looking forward to the fast paced action that made the movie gladiator exciting to watch but this game is turn based.Turn based!what were they thinking.I know there arent that many turn based games around so its a change of pace from the norm,but why on such a cool looking game?i was sorely disapointed.\n",
      "Wow i honestly expected more from Lucasarts, but this game is by far the worst game i've ever played in my entire life...and i'm not being overly dramatic. Not only are the graphics disturbingly horrible, the voice acting is dull and repetitive. The story is interesting but it's random...like really, REALLY, random. Add to this is the games mind numbingly boring combat scheme that makes dragon age feel like call of duty, and the ridiculously jacked up money/store system. And perhaps the worst element of all...the music; the music only has ONE TRACK, that is played over, and over, and over, and over, and OVER!!! When my sister and i played this, the music got so annoying that we turned the music volume to zero. This game could have been so much better. No wonder Lucasarts decided to not make anymore medieval-themed games.\n",
      "This game should be in the Platinum Hits sections.  No, make that the Old Copper Penny section.  Paying anything over 10 bucks for this game would be a mistake.  Only hardened RPGers will like this game (you know the type--the guys who sit over by themselves and even the computer nerds won't talk to them).  After  Sudeki, Fable & Jade Empire comes out, Gladius will be relegated to the Bargin Bin right next to Pong.  Anywho...this game is about as much fun as visiting a friend's dying grandmother in an old folks home (unless of course, you enjoy that sort of thing).\n",
      "This is a good game, but having to enter a sixteen character password is unforgiveable.  The game costed.., it should have a battery backup.  I was assuming it would.\n",
      "This game ranks up there with possibly being the WORST game I ever played. I got the demo way back when it came out and I loved it. I played it just about every night for a few weeks and had mastered it. I bought the game when the price went down and I installed it. The game bugged out on me in training and I couldn't drive the truck like I was supposed to. I gave up on it and a week later my computer basically tanked. I assumed that was part of the problem with the game, as I was having trouble with other games that used to play fine. I happened to have lost the game for some time and I finally found it in a box in my parent's house two years ago. I took it and finally played it a while back and I was completely at odds with the demo I remembered so well and resurrected to play before starting the game again. The game played nothing like the demo and I swear that I was losing EVERY mission even if the goals got completed. I never understood how to use the \"tactical map\" for a long time and when I finally figured it out, it still didn't help. The friendly AI has as much sense as a cardboard box, the enemies are apparently sharpshooters with tanks, and it seems that while you only take 1-3 bullet wounds to die, the enemy takes at least 10. The graphics were awful (and it isn't due to me being spoiled by newer games since I still play MS-DOS games on occasion). I couldn't believe how terrible this game was. It has been put into a box so I can forget about it.\n",
      "I am wondering if I played the same Operation:Flashpoint as the rest of the reviewers because this was the latest in a long line of terrible military 1st person shooter games.  The graphics are mediocre, while the playability is absolutely horrible.  I took this game back and exchanged it less than an hour after buying it. It ranks among the worst military shooters I have ever played along with the Delta Force games, the Clancy games(The Rainbow Six series that is), and others. Don't waste time or money on this ... game.  It's disappointing that no one seems to be able to come up with a good 1st person military adventure shooter game.  The only two decent ones I've seen recently were Medal Of Honor and Return To Wolfenstein.  Again, don't waste money on this awful game.\n",
      "I was quite excited about Operation Flashpoint after playing the demo.  It seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the PC HOWEVER, after a failed installation I went to various websites attempting to find a soloution.  I read through 30 pages of people expressing problems with the patches, installation, textures and various other features of the game.  I am sure that for those of you who can install it, it will be nice however, check out the...to see what the people who have problems are saying.  I would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixed.\n",
      "This is the worst. I want my money back. Klunky, lost, unplayable. I would give it a minus star if I could.\n",
      "I wonder who was the genius who came up with the idea of glorifying and incorporating hip-hop style violence into a video game whose target audience is made up of teenagers?  This game also shows that it is fun to beat up on women.  There's already enough gang violence in our nation's inner cities, we don't need little suburbanites to follow in the example of violent criminals.\n",
      "This game was a sinch to beat,its boring and it doesn't deserve to be rated.  Thats all I have to say.\n",
      "\"Twisted Metal: Black\" is an extremely violent game, beyond that of most first-person-shooter video games and war games. As one example, driving after intentionally hitting someone then the game has the person stuck in your front bumper as you drive around. Yick!\n",
      "When you first start playing TMB, you will be saying to yourselve, \"WOW\", until you play it for 1 or 2 hours straight, and then realize that it wasn't want you expected.  One reason why the twisted metal series was so great, was new innovation to the car combat genre.  unfortunately no new innovation has added to this game, in fact you could stay it going downhill.  The game lack so much stuff that make all the other series look like winner.  What the game lack isn't in it graphic department, but it most important aspect of any game, the gameplay.  It fast, infact it super fast, how can a 16 wheeler go as fast as a motorcycle, and realize how lame and such a poor excuse the developer of this game made it.  The car physic is probably the worst i have ever seen.  It never feel like your actually driving on the ground, every car has the same physic driving.  Instead of driving like any other game, it drive more like on ice and hovercraft style.  It lame, and also it very hard to hit your opponent.  Also every game is a handicap game, not only do the al don't shoot each other but that all the al are all trying to destory you.  It doesn't take long before a barrage of missle is aiming for your cars.  This take so much away from the game, that for beginner will be totally outwhelmed.  It also pretty hard on the easy setting because every game is a handicap games.  Now talk about going downhill, there is no replay, extra, and no clear objective to any of the mission, but rather on objective and that is to destroy how many cars the game want you to destroy.  Put in bad graphic and poor gameplay with an unexcusable 14 cars only, and you get a poor quality of a twisted metal game that the only thing going for it was the hype.\n",
      "I've tried the cable out with my cousins, and we have not found any games that have let us play two player yet.

I am still unaware of any two player games they may have gotten to work.\n",
      "Oooh! Horrible Horrible game! I saw reviews here way before the game was released. Come on have you played it before you gave it 5 stars? Just the prospect of the game?Feel free to spend your money and see how it stacks up to CTP2. Of course, Call to Power 2 was not perfect but this is abysmal. You WILL notice that the playability is extremely hard and vague compared to Activision's CTP2. Wars are strange with no stacking and each soldier fights another one!! How realistic is that? Trading is so vague with no idea of what's going on unlike CTP2 where trade routes are clearly shown. Diplomacy is also toothless and you do not get to compose a message nicely like you can in CTP. And there are many more instances that show Sid Meier is losing his touch or he doesn't have enough resources to hire enough programmers and do a good job.Mark my words, you would be better off saving your money for CTP3!!\n",
      "Civilization III has all of the aspects that made CIV II and the original huge, time-guzzling monsters.  Every turn involves the micromanagement of every possible aspect of running a society.  You have to decide what to research, what each city should build, if all of your citizens are happy enough not to revolt, what terrain squares to upgrade, and endless other options.  The time system in this game is ridiculous.  You have generally from 4000 BC to 2050 AD or less to achieve a victory.  While over 6000 years may seem like a very long time, when the game clicks off 50, 20, 10, and/or 5 years a game turn, that time runs out quickly.  Even at the lowest difficulty level, your adversaries are given huge advantages over your civilization.  They can seemingly create super units with little or no build time, supporting dozens more units than your civilization (even if they're the same size.)  The enemy's units are harder to destroy, always seeming to win even fights.  Their units can move across terrain features that would take your same units multiple moves in a single move, and they can even run away twice when your units can run away only once.  The diplomatic AI, supposedly more advanced than the previous versions, still demands ridiculous deals and the game never allows you to make similar demands or respond in the same way to those demands.  Game balancing is almost non-existent, in so much as a battleship (of the World War II type) can be easily destroyed by Iron Clads and Frigates (of the American Civil War era.)  Submarines that are supposed to be invisible to enemy units (with the exception of a VERY select few according to in-game help info) will always be attacked by ships supposedly incapable of seeing them.  Your units are always forced to fight to the death if they are the most powerful (but not healthiest) unit in a given stack, while their units are allowed to change their defense to always defend with the healthiest unit in a stack.  I could go on for hours about the excessive, abusive, intolerable, demoralizing, shameful cheating that the computer opponent is allowed to commit in the name of \"BETTER AI.\"On the technical side of the game, the interface is unintuitive and generally ugly.  Menus are in strange places, and your advisor screens are nearly impossible to get useful information from.  The graphics are a warmed over version of the Civilization II game, and the sound and music are embarrassingly poor quality.  Response time is a major issue, with late game enemy turns taking 30 seconds to 1 minute per enemy.  Start up time for the game itself is good, and I have not experienced any crashes with this game (patched version 1.16f).  Also, the game manual is large, but uninformative, and the index and table of contents are almost useless in aiding you in your search for some obscure game quirk.Overall, this game is not worth your substantial amount of time and money.  If you must purchase it, try to save as much money getting it as possible, and find all the trainers and cheat codes you can get, because this game DOES NOT PLAY FAIR.\n",
      "For people like me who loved the previous Sid Meier Civilization games, Civ3 is a bitter disappointment. There are two seemingly paradoxical reasons for this: not enough has changed, and too much has changed.On the one hand, there have been very few improvements to interface and gameplay. All the things you liked about Civ2 will be too familiar to seem fun, and all the things you disliked about Civ2 are still there and just as frustrating as they ever were. The AI is still berserkly aggressive and will attack you constantly, even when it has no hope of winning and even when there's nothing to be gained from fighting. There is a way to group units to simplify movement, but it is only available as a random result of combat (leaders) or as a capability of a rather high-level tech (military academies) that does not become available until relatively late in the game. Thus, moving armies around remains a tedious and time-consuming process of giving go-to orders to each unit individually. Master of Magic allowed you to group units for movement back in 1994. Why does Civ3 still withhold this obvious labor-saving measure 7 years later? Most of the time, this game looks, feels, and plays just like Civ2 did.On the other hand, building almost all military units now requires the player to acquire access to certain \"strategic resources.\" This is an interesting idea in theory, but the concept was implemented so severely that it cripples the game. For example, if the random map generator did not happen to place an iron mine near your starting position, you will not be able to build swordsmen, gunmen, frigates, canon, or even build railroads across your empire. You may have researched techs well into the modern era, and still have to fend your enemies off with longbows and spears because the resource rules won't allow you to build more sophisticated units. On their website the game's designers say they intended for players to be able to trade with other civilizations to acquire these neccesary supplies. Anybody who's tried to negotiate diplomatically with the previous Civ games' AI rivals knows how laughable this is: you're expected to rely upon good-faith trading with those same guys who delcare war on you every few turns! And without a source of strategic resources, you can not build any of the worthwhile military units and your aggressive AI rivals will eat you alive. It's just that simple. Complicating matters is the fact that the number of strategic resource tiles is proportional to the number of players in the game. The larger the map you play on, the harder it will be to find just those few terrain squares that have the essential resources. Since I prefer to play on large maps, I found myself unable to acquire iron in most of the games I played, and I never, not even ONCE found a source of saltpeter on my starting continent, which in Civ3 means no muskets and no canon. (Civ3 shipped with an editor that is supposed to allow you to alter the rules to your liking, but I'm afraid that when I tried this the game crashed.)The result is that it no longer matters how happy your people are, which techs you've researched, and which wonders you've built. Despite its name, this game is no longer about building a prosperous and happy \"Civilization.\" Winning or losing Civ3 depends solely on the blind luck of being granted a source of strategic resources by the map generator. If you want to fight over a few scattered resource tiles essential to mere survival, then buy Civ3. But if you want to manage and grow a prosperous empire, save yourself $ and break out your old copy of Civ2.\n",
      "Civilization II is my all time favorite computer game. When I lost that game when a computer virus damaged my hard drive I recieved the Third edition of this series. And what a utter crock of $h!t. I am so dissapointed I am almost crying in disbelief.There are so many thing that completely ruin the qualities of this so called game. First you can't bribe rival units. Second, there is no cheat mode to toggle. Third there is no complete it button to spend money to build improvements, units, or wonders. God, is there no end to this sorry story.I felt so excited when I got this game for my birthday but when I installed it all it did was crash almost a few minutes after starting and it wrecked my hard drive. Needless to say is that this is nothing but a computer wrecking hunk of garbage.I personally am going to the computer store and am buying a replacement copie of the Second civilization. This one on the other hand will be sitting on the shelf and collecting dust or heading to the garbage can.Maybe if my computer is fixed and upgraded this game will be playable and given a higher rating but from where things stand right now this is one of the biggest dissapointments ever.For those who are rushing out to buy this: Stick with your older versions because all this one will do is eat up hard drive space and ruin your hard drive.\n",
      "The eclipsing star of the computer gaming world, Sid Meyer, resurfaces to serve up a game that is every bit as exciting as watching lint accumulate.  Basically a re-warnmed version of his earlier title, &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; (a game now in re-release, which will put you back 9 bucks), but without all the cool movies that AC offered, Civilization 3 has all the action of glacial movement, the excitement of a six-hour monotonal history lecture, and all the visual appeal of a mid-80's DOS game.After buying this game, I popped it into the drive, booted it up, and five minutes later, was wishing that I had bought something more exciting- like a program that would monitor the growth of my fingernails.  I've played a lot of games- and over a game-playing hobby that has stretched over the past two decades, I cannot remember a title that was so underwhelming, so dissapointing, and so downright boring.\n",
      "I loved Civ 1 and 2, and I also loved colonization. What made those games truly great was the endless depth and the ease of play. Civ III is a radical departure from the latter. It is just too difficult to figure out. The interface is clumsy at best and the game play in my opinion has really slowed down.All in all, I am really dissapointed in Civ III. Sid Meir had to fail eventually.\n",
      "Now I know what you are going to say,\"Why did you buy this game unsure if it was compatible or not?\".Well I had done a little research and thought that, \"Just maybe\" this game would play on my PC.Okay my \"PC\" is an asus netbook but I had upgraded the RAM and felt that I had the system requirements met.Boy was I wrong!!!I was only able to install and get to the start screen,after that nothing.Okay I figured,I'll just download Win 7's xp mode. Again start screen and then nothing.I know this is a phenomenal game from all I have read I just wish I could play it.I might even go so far as to buy the OS-X version and put it on my Macbook Pro but not for now.From now on I am making SURE games are compatible before pusrchase.\n",
      "There are few games that have made me this angry, I cannot believe how unfair this game is.  The resources are bull man, I never get salt paper and even if the computer has extra it refuses to trade with me, doesn't matter though I'd bring a ton of cavalries into japan and I'll just get chopped to bits by their samuri which seem to never end.  It seems like no matter how superior your units are the comp can just tear them up with it's endless supply of grunt units, it ain't right...  I loved Civ 2 back in the day and mastered it.  But this game is unforgiving, the diplomacy is a complete headache, if you want something you have to pay an arm and a leg and you have to give away all your secrets.  I don't know, I liked 2 better, maybe 4 is good but my computer sucks... ugh.  Don't waste your time.\n",
      "As you'll probably know, civilization continues and here's the newest version of the game known as civ3. Now don't get too excited about this game, as more often, you never know how it will end up as. I know, i know, it's enjoyable but just like civ1 and 2 were, i don't really think civ3 will make any difference. Gameplay and graphics changed a little bit from civilization 1 to 2. But overall, everything is the same. Whoever made this game is a person who likes to cheat people into buying this game and wasting their money on some garbage. I'd suggest buyers think more often about the sims and simcity 3000 and if they have these games, they should be thankful to themselves. Thank you.\n",
      "This game took 20 seconds to get on my nerves.  I would expect better response and graphics from an old NES system!  Compared to the beautiful Gameboy Advance translation of Donkey Kong Country, for example, or Mortal Kombat:  Deadly Alliance, and 007 Nightfire looks like it's a game from four computer generations ago.The graphics wouldn't be a problem if gameplay were a compensation.  Unfortunately, the enemies in this game look like white blobs with vague black eyeholes, the sounds and voices sound like they were recorded with a portable tape recorder, and controls...this game should have been called 007:  Need a Stairmaster, because your 007 moves like he has lead weights attached to him.  It takes about a whole second after pressing forward before your agent starts to move forward, and strafing is nearly pointless because of it.  The control scheme requires that you stand dead still in order to shift your aim, and that is also slow and ponderous.  My thumb hurt after a couple of minutes of dealing with this control scheme, and after hacking through to Level 4, I just gave up.  I happen to value my eyesight and looking at the blobs on the screen wasn't doing my eyes any good.I was stunned that Electronic Arts, responsible for some excellent shooters (the Medal of Honor series, for example), produced this atrocity.  A game of the lowest quality.\n",
      "The GameBoy Advance Wormlight is one of the few occasions where Nintendo didn't get it right.  The only problem that affects the GameBoy advance is its lack of a backlit screen.  In normal light, this usually isn't a problem, but for naturally dark games (like &quot;Castlevania&quot;) and playing in poorly lit conditions, it can be an issue.  Alas, the Wormlight does nothing to fix the problem.  In many ways, it makes it worse.  Instead of providing a broad, soft light to enhance the screen, this light produces a narrow, harsh glare.  The glare created practically washes out any ability to see what is happening on the screen.  Check out some other lights or just go completely without one rather than wasting money on this one.\n",
      "Although this game seems quite promising, it is just a mess of bugs, frustrating load-times, and huge patches.  First off, the graphics are quite mediocre.  The building walls are paper thin and there is really nothing to the buildings other than four walls.  The characters are blocky and all of the action looks quite silly most of the time.Hopefully, you enjoy long load times.  Waiting for the game to boot up and let you into the server literally takes 2-5 minutes.  Even the offline mode takes a good 2-5 minutes to load.  And this is with a system that surpasses the recommended system configurations (I am running a P3-800mhz, 256MB SDRAM, 32MB Video, 40xCD-ROM, and Cable Modem).  Also, the game says it only requires a 56k modem to play, but even with a cable modem I experience terrible lag in big battles.  Also, you'll hate your 56k connection when it comes to downloading patches (last patch I downloaded was about 70 MB!).The gameplay itself isn't too much fun either.  It is pointless to try and go foot-soldier seeing as how EVERYBODY uses tanks!  Trying to be infantry will get you either run over or killed in one good tank blast.  Since you're able to just select what to use in battle, is it any wonder that this game has become a war of tanks?  In the whole time I've played I only come across infantry when it's the person's very first time playing. After that they quickly learn to just use the tanks.  Knowing who to kill will be frustrating as well.  Everyone's name in the game is blue, and although you cannot damage an ally, you will spend a considerable amount of time shooting at the wrong targets.All in all, the game is terrible.  Fighting the battles is aggrevating, but not as aggrevating as finding a battle to fight (there are no NPCs, so you have to find other players to fight).  On many servers you'll notice the Allies are quite outnumbered by the Axis.  Every battle I have played has been won by the Germans.  The game is just chaos, no structure, no commanding officers (unless doing missions, and not really even then).  It's basically jump-in, shoot, die, jump back in, shoot some more, die again.  There's no real goal or purpose.  No medals to be awarded and no real benefits to acheiving a high rank.\n",
      "First of all I must inform you that in order to play this game online you must download a 70MB 'patch' file. That is just far too large of a download for those of us stuck with a dial up connection. If you have a high speed connection 70 Megs isn't that big of a deal though.Ok - on to the game then. I am running a P3 500 which is well within the system requirements. I also have a 32MB video card. The offline practice mode takes no less than 3 minutes to load up. Unacceptable. In trying to map the controls I found that the game would not allow me to program my joystick. Unacceptable. As a ground troop my gun would not fire. In flight the sound would cut out intermittantly (and no I wasn't blacking or redding out). The graphics are horrible and low tech in comparison to other recent games. The interface is slow and clunky. I could go on but you get the point (I hope).Wait until this game has time to mature into a proper peice of software - this release is nothing more than an incomplete beta version. Which is a shame because most beta software is free, while this cost me 40 bucks.\n",
      "I would like to be able to write a review for Mech Commander 2, but I am unable to play this game on any computer in my house. It seems that Microsoft has chosen to add a copy-protect program-- &quot;SafeDisc&quot;-- to render the CD-ROM incompatible with every single drive I have. A readme file included with Mech Commander warns the user of this problem, when it is too late.Unfortunately, Microsoft neither includes a warning on the box, nor posts a list of incompatible drives on the Web-- as of this writing. Those who have not yet purchased Mech Commander 2 should be aware that, among many other drives, the CD-ROM fails with the following: Sony CDU5211, Sony CDU77E, Acer CD-624a, Memorex CD-RW2224, Plextor CD-ROM PX-32TS (SCSI), Sanyo CRD-256P, and the Yamaha 2216E, 4416SX, and CDR6416S-VK. The full list is probably much longer. Microsoft does indicate that the Sony CDU77E should work if it is configured as a master drive, but all of the others listed are right out.I am personally going to contact Mircosoft about getting a replacement disc. I suspect a patch will not arrive, since this is a hardware issue, and Microsoft obviously will not do anything to override a system they just spent money to install and distribute. It may behoove the reader to write Microsoft for a full list of incompatible drives.\n",
      "Don't let anyone fool you.  This game is a pure 1 dimensional dungeon crawl of epic boredom.Your first impression upon starting the game is that it really is fun, and the graphics are good, and the gameplay is nicely paced.  It was based on those same sentiments that my friends got me to buy it after they had been playing it for 2 days.Sadly, I did buy it.  By the time I had it installed, most of them were complaining that it was getting repetitive and that there wasn't much to it.  Just gather up your NPC's and keep going, boy!Really, this is a game where if you buy enough healing/mana potions, you can survive anything, since your npc's will drink for themselves, and if you get one of the healers with the group heal spell, you can kill for hours without taking a breather, if the mobs would hold out that long.Needless to say, I was finished with the game after a week, and looking for some poor sap to unload it on, because there is no replay value.  You can't make different decisions, so its a one shot deal.Stay away!\n",
      "I would like to write more, but the game just put me to sleep...Go buy some grass seed, plant it, watch it grow... much more fun then this game...\n",
      "This is is a game from a LONG line of diablo clones.  The basics of the game are just a rip-off from the diablo system.  The only significant difference is the addition of quite good graphics.Unfortunatly this is one of the most uninteresting games i've ever played.  I pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about 10 minutes into this game.  The plot is pretty much just meeting some schmuck on the road and he tells you something to do, so you go do it, and kill things along the way.  I mean come on...that was pretty fun at first but after Diablo, Diablo 2, and the numerous clones they spawned; that sort of thing has kind of gotten old.You can only play as a human character and theres very few modifications you can do to your characters looks (and all of those modifications are abhorantly cheesy looking).The advancement system is pretty simple, and i think thats why its boring.  If you want you character to be good in melee weapons; then you smash things with a sword.  Want an archer?  shoot things with a bow then.  Want character who can smash and shoot?  then smash things with a sword half of the time and shoot with a bow the other half.But the thing that really made me hate this game was the camera angles.  They jammed so many stupid trees and caves and mountains into the screen that you cant see ANYTHING.  you have to spend about a minute moving your camera around before you can see anything, giving yourself an epileptic seizure in the process.  I found it easist just to play the game completly in the \"mega-map\" mode.  In that mode all the silly graphics dont get into your way and you can actually see where you're going.  But of course in the map mode you reduce the game to commanding a dot around and telling it to kill things.The game did suprise me on how smoothly it ran.  Usually microsoft games give me alot of trouble with choppy graphics and game crashes.  But this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast.  Figures that the only game they make the runs smooth is the one i'm not interesting in playing...All in all if you're up for a diablo clone i'd recommend throne of darkness, forget about this waste of 1 gigabyte.  On the up side it may make a good game for children...\n",
      "READ THIS REVIEW IT IS VERY HELPFULMy friend got this game and he was saying stuff &quot;you gotta get it, its so cool&quot;  I was so exited to get EQ trilogy.  Finally I saved up enough money to pay for it for a few months.  By the way thats a badthing, you have to pay $13 a monthly fee to play.  Finally I started to play it and that weeks I played it every day.  day 1, awesome.. day 2, awesome.. day 3, awesome, day 4 5 and 6, awesome... day 7, SUCKED!  after a few days of playing it, not only it gets old, but you learn your way around the game and figure out that its really dissapointing.  The graphics are pretty good.  but thats about the only good part.  its impossible to gain levels, it takes so long.  After 5 days of gameplay, 3 hours each of nothing but fighting, training, fighting, training I was level 4.  I didnt take one break, not a lunch break, NOTHING.  Thats how hard it is.  I didnt die once either.  It is hard to find your way around.  the 7th day before I got rid of it, it took me an hour to find the magic shop where you buy new spells to use. it is hard to use some spells, like hide.  it never works. not many people are friendly.  I only joined a group 1 time and that was with a friend my friend who I knew in real life.  Even in the daytime, it seems kind of like it is still dark.  It just barely lightens up.  It is still about the same.  You need a torch which doesnt help much.  you can turn up your gamma and it will be easy to see but it will be like that the whole time even at night so it takes away the fun.  It takes forever to get enough money to buy stuff unless you do a trade skill which is hard.  It is nothing like the commercials, they say you go on challenging quests, fight dragons and other monsters, go on an adventure of a lifetime!  YOUR KIDDING RIGHT? For crying out loud You have to stay in the same town until you are like level 20 which takes about a year, if youll leave in half a minute some monster will kill you.  I can go on and on but I am getting tired.SO......DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!! WAIST OF MONEY!!!!!!!  WAIST OF TIME!!!!!!\n",
      "This game doesn't make much sense in terms of the Star Wars universe.  It was clearly made to be as similar to Age of Kings as possible.  Yeah, it's pretty cool to select some Tie Fighters and tell them to attack, or to move around an At-At, but I'm sorry, Wookies, Naboo and Gungans are all lame.  It suffers from all the same problems as Age Of Kings:- Really really slow action, where everything takes forever- Sound is really bad.  It sounds sample from someone's VHS copy of Star Wars- Missions are boring- Too many units- So many resources that you spend all your time making drones to chop down trees.Additionally:- The graphics are sub-par.  The color palletes for things are not right and there's a lot of dithering.  It looks really bad.- Each &quot;race&quot; is essentially exactly the same as the others.  All have basically the same units and tech, with minor differences to make it appear that they &quot;balanced&quot; the game.Do not buy this.\n",
      "this games sucks..the controls r radically hard lol radically  ..you need 2 memorize like 30 different buttons 2 run, jump, crouch this n that ..im on a laptop so ..it probably made it suck on ly more lol ..honestly id rather master the kotor like 20times b4 going threw this thing\n",
      "LucasArts STOLE MY MONEY!this is one of the worst games i've bought in 4 years. Although the graphics may be fancy thats about it. The game play is terrible, the levels are dry, and the animations are choppy (even on my P4 256ram!!!!). Its like the only thing they focused on was pretty still pictures to lure unsuspecting gamers with screan shots. This game is JUST NOT FUN!In addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version. I believe that they released this game way to early and I would not buy this product! Save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo on!STARWARS stamped across the box cannot justify such a terrible game.\n",
      "&quot;Jedi Outcast&quot; is the third installment in the outstanding &quot;Dark Forces&quot; series.  Sadly, it is also the first misfire.  &quot;Dark Forces&quot; and &quot;Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight&quot; were superb games both in terms of graphics, gameplay, and story arc.  Admittedly, the graphics are good for &quot;Jedi Outcast&quot;, but it fails miserably with gameplay.  The keyboard plays a singularly important role in any PC-based video game.  With that being fact, it's imperative that actions that keyboards performs be smooth and fluid.  It was with the two previous installments in this series, but the control is nothing short of totally aggravating.  The movement is 'herky-jerky', almost like it regressed to earlier technology.  Aiming the weapons at the targets is nearly impossible because the targets move too fast to acquire with the current setup.  Also, trying to pan the player's view up and down and from left to right is very shaky.  The gameplay is so awful that I have been forced to stop playing the game because I do not have the patience to deal with it.  I suspect the game, itself, may actually get quite good.  Unfortunately, I cannot give a rating based on how good I think the game could be if only the gameplay were better.  The fact that the game is too aggravating to continue to play dooms &quot;Jedi Outcast&quot; to the lowest score possible.  Perhaps the versions ported for actual gaming systems perform much better.  If they do, I will review this game much more favorably for that platform.\n",
      "how could they of ruined Atari? well they did. controls messed up and cant play for ******** so I don't like it\n",
      "InterAct have recently replaced the GameShark2 v2 with a new GameShark2 v3. The codes for the v3 are incompatible with the v2 codes, and vice versa. InterAct are no longer publishing v2 codes for current games. You can buy an upgrade to GameShark2 v3, but you have to send back your v2 CD... meaning you're without the codes for your older games. So it looks like InterAct wants to try and push people to go out and buy a whole new GameShark2 v3, so they get more cash.Meanwhile, [...] has codes for GameShark2 v2, which was actually the Action Replay unit under a different name. So rather than being forced to pay InterAct for a v3 upgrade, go there instead!\n",
      "If you can, find another cheat device. Eighty percent of the people I have talked to(500 people or so) have said their's lasted a max of four months and then had a fatal glitch. Mine lasted a little over three. The gameshark deleted 90% of my codes and garbled the other 10%. To top it off I can't even reload them because of a &quot;Hardware not detected&quot; error. THIS IS COMMON AND CAN'T BE AVOIDED. It's a piece of junk. I'm looking into the Pelican code breaker mentioned by one of the other reviewers. It has to be better than this. Save your money or buy something else.\n",
      "Let me just say this once...RIP OFF! Games can be hard at some points, and its sometimes hard to get the most coolest weapons, items, etc. Well, O.K. but, thats why there are strategy guides. Gameshark gave me alot of codes to get my HP and MP higher, also weapons, items, and I finally killed Evrae on Final Fantasy 10. But listen to this, I had this game shark for about 5 to 6 months and yeah that does seem along time but...1.) I put the gameshark disc into the PS22.) It started to load...then said DISC READ ERRORAfter that I took the disc, cleaned it and the PS2 but still didn't work after that.SAVE YOU MULA ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT W O R K S for your lifetime!Oh, excuse me I left something else... it ERASED my important battle skills and my peoples HP. And when I tried to beat this one boss, it had more HP then its suppose to be. Like the bosses HP was suppose to be 100,000 when it turned the HP into MAYBE atleast a million!\n",
      "First, if you have the old playstation 2 (not slim and without the network built in)don't buy!!!  The disc is undersized compared to a regular disc.  You will spend hours attempting to get the disc to read because it has to be placed \"just right in the reader.\"Next, the discs are blue on the bottom and are so delicate if you even think about a scratch, you will have one.  And finally, the gameshark website takes 2-5 weeks to update codes for new games.When it works and you have the codes, its great.  But that is few and far between sessions.\n",
      "Just purchased this thing a few hours ago. I have yet to see it work. It's going back to the store.\n",
      "So far I had 2 gamesharks, both of which were defective. However, I was lucky enough and my PS2 din't mess up, but if you do use this [terrible]peripheral you'll probably end up buying a new PS2.As far as the product itself it's ok, but it will mess up soon enough. So, if you want a cheating device, I'd suggest code breaker, it's better and has a better (and wider) variety of cheats, and if you can't find a cheat for that use one for the gameshark, and it will work!I am very dissapointed in Interact, I lost all faith in them....If you already have a gameshark go get your receipt and hold on to it, and when it breaks take your money back and go get the Codebreaker.\n",
      "If you still have &quot;Pac Man Fever&quot; check out NamcoMuseum for the GBA. It has Ms. Pac Man, and many other games which put these to shame. As someone who works in video games, I never heard so many complaints about a game, as I did this one (i.e. - too difficult, too boring etc)\n",
      "Now, I'm just about the biggest Final Fantasy fan around, but FF4 is just nothing compared to FF7. FF4 doesn't have anything in it that can match the horror of when AERIS DIES!!!!!!!!And man, that Chrono Trigger game.  What's the deal with that? That isn't even Final Fantasy at all, just like the FF Movie.  Chrono Trigger was incredibly boring, and I was displeased with its lack of random encounters. And it should have had cool characters, like Cloud, and Aeris, and Barret, and Wedge, and Tifa.  They were great.\n",
      "PSO is a great game, my friend brought it over and it's incredibly customizable and fun to play, if you want a game to brainwash you into playing more and more and more, this is your game. However i'd advise against the version 2 very very strongly, you have to give Seganet your credit card number to play this and it costs like 24 bucks a month or something for a few extra levels. However PSO is a very very good game and you can head out today and buy PSO and a keyboard for 45 bucks and never pay a cent. It's kind of a no brainer unless you live, eat, sleep, bleed, sweat, etc... PSO.\n",
      "That's right to play this game online you have to pay! My friends and I being hardcore Sega fans are very disappointed. You already have to pay 40 bucks for the game. In this version there is only new items and new levels no new characters. I would recommend purchasing the first one it is very good and you dont have to pay to play online. I also recommend Sonic Adventure 2 it is way fun the best sonic game ever.\n",
      "I bought this knowing that the servers would no longer be up. I figured i would just play the single player mode in the game. However you still need to link the game with your system and if you buy it used it will not come with the code needed and will be unplayable\n",
      "This product was not usable or even helpful. It glitched many of my Nintendo 64 games and caused my system to corrupt itself. It was nothing what the reviews I had read said it was. I am not pleased with this product nor will I re-purchase it.\n",
      "They said it was in Good condition, thats what i was hoping for until i put the card into my controller to save my game for 007 World is Not Enough and it said \"Controller Pak may be damaged or broken\" well it was! I am not happy at all about this product and will never buy from this person/company again!\n",
      "Popped it into my N64 and tried to use it.  Was immediately taken to a screen telling me that the memory card was broken and would not work.  Gunna try getting another memory card like this brand new hopefully that one works as I need a memory card in order to play Turok Rage wars\n",
      "The momory card I received was NOT the one pictured.  I received a generic knock off product.  My PS1 did not even recognize it as a memory card.  Beware!  Amazon are you reading this? I hope so.\n",
      "well the cord is alright but i didnt know that kind of cord went to a playstation 2.\n",
      "Component video cables for the PS2 are supposed to be hooked up to TVs that have Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr connections.  Many newer TVs (like the ones I have) have Y Pb Pr connections.  They LOOK the same.  The manuals say that they're for component video.  But there is one crucial difference.  The Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr PS2 video output doesn't work in a Y Pb Pr TV!  They mention this in the fine print of the PS2 manual but, as I found to my sorrow, it's easy to overlook.Before you buy this (or any other) component video cable to hook your PS2 up with your HDTV check the connections on the HDTV.  If it's Y Pb Pr it probably won't work.Just to be clear, I DID change the video output of the PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr before connecting the cable to the TV.  Did not work (on two different HDTVs that have Y Pb Pr connections)The cable itself doesn't deserve a \"1\" rating.  I'm almost sure that if you have a HDTV with Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr connections you'll love this cable.  I just wish I could test it myself...----------------- Update 12/2/2009 ----------If you can't use component cables, S-Video works pretty well.  You're much better off with S-Video than composite!\n",
      "I got this for my ps2 and i tried to connect it to my tv and it didn't show anything.\n",
      "I got the new Component AV cable. The plug part that goes into the PS2 did not fit snug.Didnt spend over 5.00 for it,but if i had to do it over again I would have went to Radio shack to get the SONY BRAND. If you ever have to send in your SONY PS 2 make sure you use SONY BRAND PARTS /CABLES (anything really). If you use this part your WARRANTY is not worth the paper it is printed on. Check out Playstation FAQs at their website.\n",
      "Stopped working after about 6 months.How do A/V cables stop working when you plug them in and dont touch them?!? I can understand them wearing out if their being plugged in and unplugged constantly,but to just stop working? Cheap .99 cent store quality.I guess you get what you pay for.\n",
      "I bought these cables thinking they would improve the picture quality of the PS2 while playing on my HDTV. Purple and green colored lines go through the picture and the colors are way off when playing video games and watching DVD's on the PS2 when using this cable. I guess for the price one cannot expect much from this company. I have already ordered an official Sony component cable to replace this garbage. If you want quality then go for either Monster or an official Sony component cable if you want to improve picture quality of your PS2 gaming and movie watching experience. This company should not even be able to shovel out crap like this to people!\n",
      "Doesn't work for Y Pb Pr TVs like the other reviewer mentioned. My TV is new from 2009, I don't know why they wouldn't make compatible cables for recent TVs!! It shows the Playstation logo on the screen and then the picture freezes. Not recommended\n",
      "I tried to save a few bucks but fell into the same trap Arthur Kimes did on his review, this cable will not work on a Y/Pb/Pr HDTV, it kept bouncing back and forth from a messed up picture to \"this signal mode is not supported\" even after setting the PS2 menu to the correct component configuration instead of RGB.Stick to the official Sony Brand cables,Do not buy this.\n",
      "I tried it with my HD tv and change the settings but the television kept going black from time to time\n",
      "Thought I could get away with buying component cables this cheap for my ps2, I guess I got what I paid for. Didn't work at all, nor video or sound, when plugged into my tv, and another tv. I made sure the options were set right on the ps2/tv.I'll attempt to find out what is wrong with it and fix it, but it isn't worth the refund because of the shipping fee.Not really too much of a loss though all in all\n",
      "Ok, since I'm an adult my view on this game is likely very biased.  While the first ten minutes of gameplay was fun, I soon beat most of the tracks (with Peach) and it just became boring.  I can imagine this could be a good game for kids: driving and shooting and throwing bananas...  And there are 20 tracks to choose from (16 of which are available right away).  Unfortunately there appear to be a few bugs with the software that can frustrate the player.  In the end, I regretted paying (...) for a game that I won't touch again.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong; I love Mario Kart! However, you sometimes meet a terrible game in a series. Mario Kart: Super Circuit is obviously no fun IMO compared to Mario Kart 7. I enjoyed Mario Kart Advance when I was younger, but now I think it's just a gimmick to show off what the Game Boy Advance could do in 2001. This game is OVERRATE just like ALL Zelda games after the Super NES announcement.\n",
      "Dont buy this game! It is horrible! The cartoons look like an ages 2 and up board game. It is ditsy, dinky, and silly. Go buy a REAl strategy game. This stinks.\n",
      "Ok so i've had this for well about 2 weeks and idk somethin happend and all my stuff i had saved became corrupted and even after i cleared it,it just never stops corrupting data.This is one of those things where you feel good to save money but then you find out that it wasn't worth the box it came in.I think it would be a good ideal to stay away from this and get the brand of the thing your gonna be puttin it in.\n",
      "I don't know exactly why it is, but usually memory devices for game console made by 3rd-party manufacturers are inferior in quality. They are cheaper, of course. However, I experienced a couple times of complete data loss from 3rd-party memories from the time of PS1. The situations were all the same: both 3rd-party and genuine memories were inserted to console all the time, yet only 3rd-party one failed.Not all 3rd-party memories will fail, of course. Even memories from same company show difference. However, since I haven't experienced data failure from genuine memories yet, I do recommend you to buy genuine memory, rather than to test your luck.\n",
      "I can't emphasize that enough-EVEN A DIEHARD SURVIVOR FAN WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME! I was severely disappointed. Loving Survivor, I expected the game to involve more strategy and conversation. This game could've been a best seller, but Wizard Works blew it.First of all, the game is poorly put together. After about 5 hours of gameplay--4 of those 5 hours in which I was bored, the game broke. I have a new computer Windows 2000 and I was really mad that I spent [money] on this game and it broke within a few days. It wouldn't load the game up. Now I'm going to give you my reasons for buying and not buying this game. Poor Graphics. The Conversations with other teamates are bland and the other computer-played characters respond with the same strange responses over and over. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hold an understandible coversation with them!The Voting system is hard to understand.The reward/immunity challenges are always the same bland, old thing. If you win a reward challenge, the reward is the same. Voting out another person and winning is fun for about--an hour.To conclude, this game turned to be nothing to talk about.Coming from a simulation game LOVER and one who has a fascination with Survivor, don't get this game.\n",
      "...The Ai is like a log.  It has horrible challenges.  The multiplayer ...  Tribal council is lame.  You can't even make alliances.  I don't get it, who would want this interactive ...  Even hardcore survivor fans wouldn't want this piece ...  Let's hope markaysas is better.  I mean Magic Lantern has like 20 developers.  Don't get it!!\n",
      "I am not one who writes a lot of bad reviews - I think I am fairly easy to please.  I love playing computer games and I don't need fancy graphics to make me happy.  I am also a HUGE Survivor fan, so of course someone bought me this game as a gift when it came out.I played it for a few hours, and it was a complete waste of time.  I can deal with the crappy graphics, but gameplay itself is just boring.  You walk around camp and talk to people, but the conversations make absolutely no sense.  The person will tell you they hate someone in one sentence, then the next sentence they will tell you you're crazy for wanting to vote that same person off.  The computer AI also seems to automatically go for you during the votes, no matter what.  I played probably 30 different times and each time if I didn't win immunity, I got voted off first or second.The immunity challenges are somewhat fun, but there is very little variety so I got bored of them quickly.  The voting is kind of fun, if you have immunity!  Otherwise, be prepared for a quick &quot;Game Over!&quot;I can see how making a game of the show would be difficult - the entire show is about human relationships which are hard to adequately present in a computer game.  Anyways, this game is a waste of money.  It's quite simply not FUN.\n",
      "It never worked for me on the 4 computers I tried it on. (Windows 98, ME, XP, and XP) even when my computer lived up to all the specs on the box. A definite do not buy!\n",
      "My wife is the \"Survivor\" freak and I got this game thinking it would get her involved with me and gamming (and the price was right at the time). Well she played it for like 20 minutes and the game never came up in conversation again. What a bad idea. In hind sight, the game publisher should have paid me to play the game and think I would have thrown it back at them.AI is hard to get right in any game, but this game set a new standard in REALLY STUPID AI. While in camp mode, your supposed to walk around, conduct tasks, talk to tribe members and influence their decisions while making alliances. It never mattered what you did in camp, it made absolutly no difference in the rest of the game.The challenges were just too stupid and repetative to list. You could make it to the end of this game in one sitting because winning immunity was that easy.The graphics were terrible. The sound was terrible. Overall, just a terrible game. You will not surive this if you buy it.\n",
      "I am a long time Nintendo fan. Even now, when I have a Playstation 2, and no Gamecube, I still like Nintendo more. So this review is not just a bias complaint about Nintendo vs. Playstation.This version of THPS2 is terrible. Oh, yeah, it's tons of fun when you haven't played the Playstation version, but when you have, you realize just how pitifull this is. On PS, it's rated T, because they don't blurt out words like &quot;hell&quot; on songs. On Nintedno, It's rated E, so the whole family can enjoy censored versions of songs by Powerman 5000, Papa Roach &amp; Rage Aganist the Machine. And another thing music wise: THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY THE WHOLE SONG! They cut out one of the choruses and the verses (this is an example), and just let it go from there. And the track doesn't go to the next track when it's done; it just plays over and over and over, to where you have to change it yourself every 3 listens. And it's not just the music. There's too much to say, so just play the PS version, PLEASE!\n",
      "this game is an old fashion side scrolling fighting game where the character is walking towards the left of the screen and several monsters are chargeing at you from the right. you are not allowed to proceed until you have beat all the monsters that are attacking you. but thats it. that is the extent of the game. you can fight one on one with someone else who has the game. also the characters stand and move much the same as they did in fighting games from the 80's.my copy ended in a used games store in less then 12 hours after i brought it.conisering the vast potention of GBA, this game is a waste of money. there are sever fighters like tekken that are out and much better)\n",
      "well, i loved RE2 and RE3 and i assumed this one would be just as good.  Boy was i wrong.  This is one of the worst games i have ever played.  The graphics are improved, but the plot is just absolute excrement and the characters bite.  the weapons are awful too and the controls seem much more difficult to manipulate. don't waste your time or your money\n",
      "Being new to the genre, I, for 5 years now, have been hearing that Resident evil is the most goriest and scariest game on the market. So I rented this one for PS2. This has to be the most overrated garbage I've ever played. The battles are so boring, I could crawl on my hands and knees and go faster than these zombies. The dogs? They're awful. To think that dogs are demons are stupid enough. This makes a fishing game look like Final Fantasy! And the voiceovers, ugh! Especially that boy. \"You'd only slow me down! Huaa!\" What a ... nerd. Don't play it.\n",
      "This game totally sucks majorly me and my dad were trying to play this game we got on the first level and then couldn't even get off the first level with reading the instruction manual too and cheats off of cheats codesguides .com worst game ever the first level your stuck in cell in complete darkness and keep walking around and then get no where.  Don't waste your money on this there are plenty of other PS1 and PS2 games that you can waste your money on.  Oh and you can play PS1 games on the PS2 for those of you who don't know that.\n",
      "Capcom doesn't seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment, not torture. The first boss battle is so hard I just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin. This is not my idea of fun! Don't waste your money on this crap. All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on. You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo, then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill (you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie). RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge. If you still wanna try this game, don't pay more than 5 bucks!\n",
      "This is by far the stupidest game ever made. And its a shame because I love the resident evil series but this game is an embarassment you should rent before you buy it. Or save precious time and not play it at all\n",
      "I never saw a horror-survival game before, and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me.  So, I rented Silent Hill 2.  I figured I would be scared out of my mind, battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere, hearing strange spooky sounds, basically playing the game on the edge of my seat.  How wrong I was.First off, this is a sorry attempt at a game.  People say this is a puzzle game.  In it's loosest definition - yes it is.  The same way old games like King's Quest were puzzle games.  Basically, all you do is walk.  That's it.  You walk.  Really nothing else.  You walk and hope you find something.  Then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else.  That's it.  There's no complex or intriguing puzzle, it's just search around until you grab something.That was cool, in the 1980s, when game makers needed to make 50 hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters.  This is the 2000s, and there is no excuse for it now.So, all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster.  That wouldn't be so bad - if they didn't make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world!  To move from one end of the street to the other takes forever.  The controls are sticky and clumsy, and the guy is really, really slow.  Since there's fog or darkness, you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next direction.How about the environment?  Not once was I scared or awed.  The graphics are below par for a Playstation 2 game.  The fog is cool for a second, but annoys you afterwards.  The monsters are a joke.  They're little bodies that couldn't frighten a 8 year old girl loaded with caffeine.Also, the \"puzzles\" are just plain ridiculous.  For example, here's what you have to do when you enter the town.  You're just in the town with no explicit instructions.  So you wander, then wander some more, then you finally find a key.  Big whoop, a key.  Then you wander some more to find where the key goes to.  So, after playing for an hour, you've opened a gate.  In Grand Theft Auto 3, you would have already killed a few people, and completed some fun missions.  In ICO, you would have explored a large castle, rescued a girl, and escaped dreadful spirits.  This game - you only opened a damn gate.  Once you're in the apartment building, you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same.  Finally, after another hour, what do you get?  A cool new weapon?  A great story cut-scene?  No - you get a flashlight.  What does the flash light do?  Reveal new secrets?  Find new terrifying monsters?  No - you can now read the map of the apartment building.  Two and a half of hours of game play, and I've done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map.  Bored already?What's worse is when you need to something to continue the story, but they won't tell you what.  This means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you didn't do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building.  Remember, moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself.  After being stuck for a few hours because I didn't go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin, I knew this game had no hope.  I continued on until I reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same.  I promptly shut off my PS2 and returned the game to [the store].Finally, in order to save, you actually have to actively search out the save game places.  This was the final straw.I kind of wanted to see the ending, but then I figured what it was.  Here's a spoiler for you.  The monsters that roam the town?  They're not trying to kill you.  Their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death, warning you to return this game immediatately!You want a good puzzle game?  Get ICO instead.  This game just plain [smells].  It stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of you.\n",
      "That's not true, I did enjoy the manga-styled Bomberman movie scenes, but the game... EUH! It's the ancient style, offers very little, and NO variety. I enjoyed the N64 Bomberman for it's multi-player, here they left that out and it left a big gap. Trying to play is ridiculous, the computer loses about 7 percent of the time, and it's no fun attempting to beat them. You never feel responsibility for the loss. The game can change soo quickly that it might as well be set to one minute, to save us time. There's way too much going on in one screen, like 50 different things and it's like you're supposed to try to watch it all, and you don't... and you lose. Also, there isn't even an Adventure mode here! It's all bombing in a small space. You always start out in a cramped area, far away from opponents. It's so old, and dull, it's begging for a drastic gameplay overhaul, like the N64 version (not saying that was great, but it WAS a direction with genuine innovation). All of the elements exist for a fun game, but it doesn't ever come together. I kept wondering when I would get to the fun part. ...\n",
      "Lufia: Game Boy Color game, it stinks so bad, the game is just about religion and what not. This game is SO boring that it doesn't even deserve to be played. If you want a game goto Digital Press and pick up a copy of Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. This game is the worst game ever in that matter; if you want your 10/10 get an original game boy w/ all of the Super Mario Land Games.\n",
      "Man this is the worst game I've had the misfortune of buying... I mean customer who'll buy it off me.  Anyway the graphics take us back to that old PS game Akuji.  While that's not all that horrible I thought I'd at least get Soulreaver graphics on a PS2 game! Also the brightness of the game is pretty low.  Going in the water is horrible, you can barely make out your character! The load times are also longer than the single load time on NBA Live 2001!!  Also the game seems to load at every minor junction.  Just getting past the training portion I had to wait for loading about 6 times!! Finally the controls are not bad but nothing to write about, so I won't.  Overall I was highly dissapointed with the game.  More than I want my money back, I want those missed hours of my life back!\n",
      "I cannot believe I spent the money for this game.  This is a gamers worst fear to buy a game like this one.  A friend told me of a Viking game on a PC that was totally awesome and said it was a must buy.  He must of meant some other Viking game called Rune: Viking Warlord cause this game was awful not awesome.  The loading time, the crazy controls, the lack of a descent story are all reasons to avoid this title like the black plague.  I mean it - the only reason I gave it one star is cause that was the worst I could.  The best thing about this title is the time it gives you while it is loading.  For instance you could clean your room, walk your dog, mow the lawn, paint the house, wash your car, and even sleep in the amount of time it takes between each level. This is really an awful title. Sorry if you already bought it.\n",
      "But this was one of the worst. I have to agree with most people here. Avoid Rune at all costs.\n",
      "Vikings.Gotta love em.Tearing mutton right off the bone sans utensils,donning ever fashionable pelt and ram horn outfits,and never letting the smell of blood leave their nostril hairs,have established Vikings to some as the ambassadors for masculinity at its mightiest.Unfortunately,RUNE VW MAKES TIM ROBBINS FROM ERIK THE VIKING LOOK LIKE THE HARDEST NORSEMAN TO SWING A BATTLE AXE.Expect to laugh out loud when enemies sprint past Ragnar{so he has to run after them},make a U-ey then decide to attack him.Or how about the annoying falling boulders,oversized carp looking for lunch,and turnstiles that remarkably cause instant death.Weapons,albeit plentiful,aen't thrilling to behold or obtain.And cheesy haunted house style ambient backdrops,as well as voiceovers that come off amateurishly pitched down,not ominously Odin-ish,make one wonder if human head's just being facetious.All in all,since it's hard to take RVW's action or adventure elements seriously,it's snooze city.Shame.Never thought Vikings could be boring.\n",
      "I had the misfortune of playing this game as well, and might I say I was greatly disappointed.  Don't judge games by their covers.  Being a pagan myself, I had high hopes for my hero Ragnar, but that R3 camera rotating to see what you were doing sucked SO much I didn't even bother finding out what OTHER aspects of the game blew.Don't waste your money OR time on this.  I'm tempted to do an \"angry video game nerd\" and try to get through it, but I can't see spending $2 on a used copy that isn't even worth the plastic it is printed on.\n",
      "Avoid at all costs. These guys were just not up to the challenge of making a PS2 game.\n",
      "Tell you what, don't think that Rune is a bad game, it is horrible for the PS2 though, because sony playstation 2 is too weak to handle the Unreal Technology...BUT, the PC and MAC versions are a lot better.OK, why should you NOT buy the PS2 kind? Just because the frame rates are low, graphic details look extremely blurry(you might even think you need glasses, because you won't believe that the developers would actually put such graphics for the PS2), and the controls are terrifying. There is only one, very minor pro there: the game is quite long, but since the two of the most important factors of a good game are so stinking bad, it does not matter.I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THE PC VERSION, WHICH I WOULD RATE 5 STARS, ...\n",
      "There is nothing about this game that I like.  The camera is annoying, the controls clumbsy and the music uniteresting.  The graphics were ok, but the scenes were too dark and depressing for me.  The monsters were unimaginitive and the weapons pretty typical.  I got through a few days and realized that not only did I not care, but I was really unhappy with it.  I kept playing, thinking something would make it worth the reduced price I paid for it.  I haven't played it since.  I wish I could give it zero stars.\n",
      "I bought a Half Life and add-on pack because of all the hype surrounding HL. You would think being Game of the Year would mean that its actually good. Ha!, not the word i would use.Maybe i am too much into realism in my games, real weapons, real people etc, but I thought HL was ^&#^*. I would not recommend Half Life and i can't understand why it was so popular.\n",
      "I realize I'm reviewing an old game here and I'm writing this review with 2008 standards. Please keep in mind I am only reviewing the PS2 version (not PC).If you're one of those fans considering to track this old game (on PS2) and spend lots of money on it -- don't bother wasting it.The PS2 version is just really frustrating. Some games still look good on the PS2 even to this day. However, this game just isn't worth tracking down and playing it again, on the PS2.Like most games that are poorly ported onto console, this game is no exception. There are many slowdowns. That is my biggest complaint. It's not that the graphics are so demanding, but it just isn't optimized well.This game is considered a classic and really took FPS to a whole new level when it came out. However, to fully appreciate that, even in today's standard, go with the PC. Instead of paying $20 or more for the PS2, just for the rare factor (unless you just want to put it on your shelf or something and collect dust), it's better to buy the Half-Life Anthology (where you get many expansions) for less than $10 now. You don't even need a fast computer and everything will be smooth. Plus, you'll get to use a keyboard and mouse -- the way it is meant to be played.But for better graphics, I recommend getting the Orange Box, which has Half-Life 2 and even the original Half-Life with updated graphics.So my 1-star rating is for the PS2 version.Update: The Orange Box does not seem to include Half-Life: Source (original Half-Life game with updated graphics); however, it seems you can purchase/download later on Steam for about $10 extra. Since The Orange Box is around $30 now, it's not too bad, considering most of us paid $50 for Orange Box when it was first released. However, I think the best way to go is try to track down \"Half-Life 2: Game of the Year Edition\", which includes Counter-Strike: Source as well.\n",
      "This is goin to be fun.  Half-Life is without a doubt the worst video game I have every played in my lifetime and that's saying something.  I beat the first four levels in the game and then I honestly couldn't take it anymore.  The story is ...not well planned, the monsters are dumb and kill you easily, the characters and graphics are bad, really bad, and finally, the whole set up is just plain [bad].  The multiplayer is no better with rooms the size of a small box and the weapons [are not good] too.  I mean, the crowbar is the best thing to use.  When a gun isn't good enough to kill people in a first person shooter, you know you've got problems.  Please save yourself and don't buy this game.  I'm so glad I borrowed it from my friend instead of buying it.  Heed my words fellow video gamers, Half-Life is terrible\n",
      "This game was too hard to learn. It took me 30 minutes just to figure out how to build a building and it took me 15 minutes after that to figure out what i did. dont listen to what anyone else tells you. dont buy. big waste.\n",
      "There is one reason why I give this game 1 star. Because of one reason...the game is creepy. Why is it creepy? If you are a smart gamer like me, you know most Wario bosses are disturbing. The bosses in this game give me NIGHTMARES!!!!!!!\n",
      "are you kidding me? i bought this game and within less than a week i returned it! it was the worst game i have ever played! if you like wario get one of the old wario games like warioland 2 for the original gba or... you can just hate wario!sure at first you play it it seems good... i loved it at first but then it just gets lamer and lamer i mean who ever heard of getting stung by a bee and turning all swollen and flying... it is ridiculous! o and turning into a triangle block! i couldnt even lookat it in stores it was so horrible and not to mention the price... (depending on where you get it) for that piece of junk! im serious im not just writing this cus all my other reviews are usually 5s but this game is horrible kirby is a pretty bad game but not worse than this! i fell asleep while playing it wen i woke up my batteries were barely left! they should probably give you some free bateries with it!\n",
      "In this game, you can shoot webs, swing across the sky and fight evil through many levels. Sound like fun? think again. This game was one of the worst I've ever played. Each level is tightly scripted, and offers little exploration and freedom. The bosses, freak-specimens, criminals and other evil dwellers that you come across are so similar it's boreing. Though they look different, they fight the same. A punch here...A shot there, it gets dull fast. The levels are repetitive, and it becomes a real chore to play through the game. The graphics arn't the best and the sound sucks. Don't wast your money on this game.\n",
      "They are 6 different colors pictured, but you only get clear and blue, and they fit, what more can I say about them. You can store pennies in them, or use them to hold your toenail clippings, or you can...put your games in them.It really stinks that Nintendo makes us but these, they used to come with the older games.\n",
      "I am a big fan of Survival Horror games and recently Ive been going back and playing older titles I never got a chance to play.To sum it up as simple as possible this game was TRASH. The controls were among the worst I've ever had to deal with.  The Weapons in this game are HORRIBLE. You basically get 1 Rifle the whole game and just keep getting little add ons which are confusing to use.This game felt like a job really. Never at ANY point in this game did I feel like I was having fun or even partially enjoying myself.All I know is this change in some ways changed my perspective on video games of the past.  Theres really no point in going back and beating old garbage video games. If a game was made more than a few years ago and you haven't played theres probaly a good reason why. IT SUCKS like this pathetic knockoff resident evil TRASH....Storyline  2/10Graphics  3/10  I honestly feel the RE graphics for PS1 are better.Weapons  1/10Fun  0/10  Id rather slice my eyes open with razorsJUST HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE !!!!!!Ok I feel slightly better now!!!\n",
      "I gave it a one star because I was a MGS fan(the biggest ever beleive me) , and I am very disappointed about this game. I Mean i loved the first game i played it 100+ hourse beat it a number of times and liked it so much.  MGS2 you dont be snake.  And the end you wait for the big ending you say now i know whats gunna happen then BOOM it ends and the whole game is pointless.  If you never played MGS then you may like it but if you were hooked on the first, give it a rest.  I was dissapointed after waiting 2 years.  All the screans of snake you see in the first 2 minutes of the game btw.\n",
      "Cons:Too much and too often talking between charactors.Video segments too longThird person view ( especialy from the top is annoying)I prefer fist person veiwThe Snake was great but Raiden was some kind of transsexual.In the portion of the game where he is stripped down and you have to actualy play the game with him running around nude with his hand covering his crotch. (...)Pros:Finaly quit playing before the game ended and went to rent a fun game.\n",
      "It's obvious from the opening sequence that a lot of effort went into this game.  The graphics and music are top notch.  Unfortunately, the game focuses entirely on the eye and ear candy instead of gameplay and story.  It is, in essence, a horrible, horrible movie.The Metal Gear franchise has never been known for believible plots, but MSG2 takes this to a whole new level.  Like always, there's a huge governmental conspiracy, this time engineered by people that supposedly died 500 years ago.  Riiiggghhht.What's even more infuriating is the fact that MSG2 is really only a side-story.  Those of you looking forward to playing as Solid Snake again will be sorely disappointed.  Instead, his efemminate counterpart, Raiden, takes center stage.  He's the typical anime adrogenous hero, all pasty skin and long hair.  His story is not compelling in the least, and the setup to the climax is, in a word, stupid.  Anyone with half a brain will quickly see where he fits in the Metal Gear universe.To make matters worse, all of the \"plot twists\" in the game merely serve to create un-needed confusion, and seem incredibly out of place in the middle of a conflict.  Otacon's story just reeks of a soap opera cliche.The enemies in the game all have their own repetoire of abilities, and are all portrayed as two-dimensional, melodramatic [fools].  They look neat and flashy, but never seem dangerous.  Instead, they seem rather comical, which eradicates any sense of true drama.  I know I'm not afraid of some guy that Rollerblades while placing bombs everywhere.The voice acting is once again horrible.  Like in the previous game, emotion is handled via melodrama.  The voices range from growly to whiney, with no middle ground.  They neither endear me to the heroes, nor do they make me fear the villains.Finally, there is the gameplay.  The gameplay, like in the original, is great.  Unfortunately, the game hardly lets you play.  The plot moves through a series of cutscenes.  You find out where to go, go there, see a cutscene of the enemy, kill the enemy, then watch another cutscene.  Repeat until you finish the game.In a phrase, this game is not a game.  It's a horrible interactive movie.  Don't waste your money or your time.\n",
      "Basically... This game sucks. The graphics suck, the dialog is boring, this title is overrated. I sold my copy to some idiot on eBay and I get a negative review because it sucks so bad. I rather play with a barbi than play this POS.\n",
      "This is the worst game ever for a PS2. Why? Lets see: No 1st Person view, guns stink, fighting stinks, plot stinks, conversations stink, movies are too long, graphics paritally stink...to sum it up in two words: THIS GAME STINKS!\n",
      "If this game were for the original Nintendo it might be decent but even then it would be hard pressed to find an excuse for why it plays so badly.I like 2D fighters. I still think Street Fighter 2 is one of the best games ever made. Samurai Showdown is another classic example of a great 2D fighter. It was this game that made me decide to pick Last Blade 2 up. If you also loved Samurai Showdown and are considering picking this game up, don't! This game is just awful.From the lackluster graphics (even for a 2D game) to the four frames of animation per sprite (character) this game is just a poor example of what fighting games should be. If you want a 2D fighter stick to the Capcom games and you should be fine. If you just want a great fighting game, Dreamcast has one of the best in Soul Calibur. If you're into samurai, get Bleemcast (or a PSOne or PS2) and get Bushido Blade 2, but by all means, ignore this piece of junk.\n",
      "What's the big deal with this game? It's not fun at all. It's way too fast. I mean, Sonic Adventure 2: Battle was fast, but not like this. In this game, you can't even see where you're going. And there's no explanation for anything. I was expecting a cool action/platformer with a few story segments. Instead, I was dropped straight into the first level with no explanation, and there was no break-up between levels, boss battles, and worlds. I was just so confused. It moved so fast that my eyes hurt, and I didn't understand it. It was a big fat waste of money.\n",
      "Expect to grind for countless hours if you want to clear bosses.  Each act contains six quests (often overlapping) and then a final act boss.  The act quests are reasonably challenging without being too frustrating, but act bosses will kill you in sometimes one, usually two shots unless you grind for an obscenely long time to get a few levels.Example: I played without grinding to the end of act 2, coming to the final boss with a Level 23 Druid with 146 hit points.  The boss has (on the EASIEST difficulty) no less than 4,000 hit points and routinely does over 100 points of damage on a single strike.  I have no desire to grind for days upon days to get to level 30, and so I have uninstalled the game to free hard drive space for something better.\n",
      "Greeting, friend. Stay a while, and listen...The original Diablo Battle Chest had Diablo 1, Diablo 2, and Lord of Destruction. This is the \"new version\", and DOES NOT INCLUDE Diablo 1.Buy the older Battle Chest.\n",
      "These games are excellent, but Diablo II was released in 2000, and the expansion was released in 2001.  Diablo I is even older, and that game was little more than a stripped down clone of Rogue (a free, open source computer RPG) with some prerendered graphics added and a cheezy story.So in essence, the idea for the game is unoriginal, and the latest content in this package was released 7 years ago, which is fast approaching a decade.  Yet, they want us to pay $40 for this.  I'm sorry, but that makes absolutely no sense; at best this entire package could be valued at $20, though in all practicality it could be sold for less than that (republished as a $15 single-disc).Blizzard is ripping you off.  Show them how you feel by not buying it--borrow it from a friend.\n",
      "This game is the most addicting game known to man.  World of Warcraft has addicting reviews, but this game really took ahold of my life.  I think I started playing since I was like 17 and stopped finally when I was about 23.  I spent 10 hours a day playing this stupid game at least and some nights I spent all night without sleep playing it.  It is a very fun game and I always wanted to get the next good weapon from a Diablo drop or something but I finally gave it up.  A very fun game if you know what your limits are.\n",
      "Played it once, then never played it again. I remember these games being so much better. lol i guess alot of years have passed.\n",
      "I wrote a review a while ago about this game saying how it was going to be bad because this game is definetely eye candy (if u could even call it that). I just played the multiplayer demo yesterday, and it was highly dissapointing... the game has so many bugs i cant describe them all... but here are a few:1. VERY LAGGY2. CAN't HAVE 5 GUNS AT A TIME. MAXIMUM OF 33. CAN't BIND SOME OF THE CONTROLLS TO THE KKEYS THAT U WANT (EXAMPLE: Can't bind strafe left to left arrow key)4. When you reload, it will do the reloading animation twice or even more sometimes5. After reloading, it will shoot uncontrollablyThe game is good for one reason. The creativity. No company would think about making a top view war strategy game and then make a sequel to it except it was a first person shooter in the eyes of a soldier in the game. So the only good thing about this game is the creativity. You can see why this game is bad now. Prepare to be dissapointed if you buy this game. Hope this helps, PEACE\n",
      "First things first. You learn spells how? Tracing the symbol with your mouse. Big Whup. it is just a cheap immitation of a leading series. half of the game, all you have to do is click, move, click, move, click, etc. the recreation of the story is so-so (which is responsible for the 1 *). i will list the pros and cons later, but first a graphics check. The {so-called} advanced graphics didn't run with my computer, so Harry's eyes were on top of his head, beside the mouth. I not so sure it was my computer, either, because I have a NVidia Geforce 3, 64 bit video card. I would buy Jedi outcast instead. one more thing, Snape isn't that mean. and, furthermore, Harry can jump 10 feet. come on! and now, the moment you have been waiting for, the Pro-con list!Pros1.good Quidditch recreation2.relatively good storylineCons1.graphics couldn't be worse2.jumping is unreal3.spells are too easily cast4.(the cruncher) IT IS NOT EXITING OR LONG ENOUGH\n",
      "Loved the books...hate this game.  Admittedly, I may not have given this game a chance.  The graphics are poor and movement is archaic.  What's up with using the arrow keys?  What ever happened to games which allow you to use a joy-pad or mouse (more effectively).  In their haste to release a video game to accompany the movie craze, EA has classified their loyal customers as well as the general public as idiots willing to spend money on any kind of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; junk. From what I can tell, this game isn't even worthy of release as freeware.  Perhaps the game improves later.  I wouldn't know because the flashing blue, red, green &amp; yellow lights all over the Hogwart's castle walls gave me a headache.  I wasted my money on this game and made the conscious decision not to waste any more of my time trying to play it.\n",
      "This is sadly one of the few games that I felt so bad about that I needed to write a review. My biggest complaint is that all shots by the enemy AI are predetermined whether they will hit you or not. This part of the game is beyond frustrating. Whenever you try to duck behind cover it doesn't matter because once that bullet is launched its gonna hit you one way or the other. All evasive maneuvers are pointless. On top of this, if you stumble upon an enemy and blow him away, he falls back and stumbles as bullets hit him. Magically he can still fire, his gun is pointed straight at the ground, but you can watch the bullet fly out and still hit you, even if his back is to you. The enemy also always knows where you are unless there on patrol. Patrollers you can sneak up on and kill, however, everyone else is always pointing there gun at you. Its rather frustrating walking around a corner to find a fortress with everyone's gun already pointed at you. The damage model is also horrendous. It always takes three shots to kill someone with a basic rifle and more with a pistol or submachine gun. The only headshot that actually kills someone is the sniper rifle. The enemies are also everywhere, you have to search every single corner of every single house, because there is always some random guy cowering in a corner just waiting for you to pass by. This is not unrealistic per say, it just that there are hundreds of them.The rest of the game is decent. It has good music and a good attempt to recreate Normandy, some of the levels are pretty fun. But compared to Call of Duty, which is more squad based with better weapons and realism, this game is a weak shooter.\n",
      "The game is great if you can get it to work. The success rate for that is horrific. It does not seem to mater what your system is based on - AMD, Intel, VIA, etc. Your chances are about 50/50. Six other folks I work with have purchased this game. Only 2 got it to work right out of the box. Two others got it to work with a lot of sweat and tears and then to find it fail later in the game (audio looping problems). The remainder gave up and returned the game. I wish I would have done the same.Support for this game is slow in comming. EA hast left it to you to debug their software and find work arounds for the numerous problems. I advise two things:1. log on to the MOHAA site and check out the user forums. It will give you a good idea of what you may face.2. Don't purchase this game until EA comes out with a major patch to resolve the problem.Good luck.\n",
      "This would be a five star review if only the program would run for more than 5 minutes. I'm running on a 1GHz P3, 256M RAM, ATI Rage 128. The demo runs fine but the full program doesn't like the video card because it keeps causing it to send an invalid signal and I have to reboot. I have the latest drivers. I don't have this problem with any other games.If you have the same video card as me, I don't recommend this game.\n",
      "MOHAA is a game that is ideally suited for the person who gives no regard for even the slightest bit of realism and decent storyline. Essentially, this game is a slowed down Quake with Germans and Allies instead of Marines and monsters.... I knew this was not going to be a Ghost Recon, Operation: Flashpoint, or World War II Online, but its pathetic, and made me remember why I gave up console games so long ago. Not even a hint of realism here.MOHAA makes me think of the movie Kellys Heroes where the Americans march right through German lines and single handedly kill hundreds of soldiers, only this isnt even comparable to the movie because its so bad!OK, the game's graphics are really nice. Not on the scale of Ghost Recon, but still nice. Maybe if the soldiers weren't so dumb and you at least had a little control over them it would be slightly better, but you don't.I really cannot recommend this game to anyone except hard-core teenage Quake players. I bet it will sell a ton, because the gaming community has very low standards for success at the moment. Ill stick with Ghost Recon, Flashpoint, and WWIIOL for now. Hopefully you will check those out if you want good, fun, realistic games.\n",
      "5 of my friends and myself have bought this game...it only works for 1 of them!!!THis game constantly crashes for my friend that it works for!WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!\n",
      "Do yourself a favor and pass on this game.  It's neither a good golf game or tycoon game.  While you will initially have fun with this game the repetitiveness of it all will quickly bore you, it's just not a good game.\n",
      "The demo for this game {if one could call it that) was on the Sims Hot Date, or some expansion for the Sims.  It seemed pretty fun, and since they restricted you to 3 courses, I really wanted to know what it was like to build a big golf resort.  And so, I got caught in the trap.  I went out and bought Sim Golf...  The worst waste of money in my life.  I quickly became bored with the different buildings (there are so few!), and although the course building tool was kind of interesting, it was far from addicting...The actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill, and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of time...It is a plain waste of time, money, and of course, megabytes.  I can't wait 'till the Sims Superstar comes out...Don't make the same mistake I did, and get a better game.  This is just a plain disgrace.\n",
      "The game looks very good for gamers that like to play on settings of very hard. Unfortunately, I am not that good. Because there are not 5 difficulty levels from very easy to very hard and even on the &quot;Easy&quot; setting I cannot get through the missions I am unable to play the game.\n",
      "I bought this game expecting something similar in quality to Novalogic's \"Delta Force LandWarrior\" game. What I got was a system-devouring, buggy crash-fest.The game installed without incident, and I played the first mission without too much consternation (why does the mission suddenly stop when most of the bad guys are down? No mopping up allowed? I took off from the base, can't I find my way back and land?) but the next mission had too many tanks or planes I guess.At first, the game turned into \"Commanche 4: The Slide Show\", then it crashed--Ka-Boom! I realized that when I came over a particular hill during this mission at a particular angle of attack, the game would have a stroke and start locking up. If I ran into another chopper (one appears in the distance), the game would brain-freeze. I have been playing alot of graphically intense programs lately with no problems, I have a Geoforce2 card, 512MB of RAM and a P4 machine; so what is the problem??Who knows. The graphics in this game are'nt that hot, the gameplay would be almost worth it, if Commnche 4 worked properly. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!Buy the \"Commanche Vs. Hokum\" game instead, it is MUCH better: a realistic flight model, better controls and it does'nt gobble up your computer or stop the sim when it thinks you're finished playing.\n",
      "This game is extremely annoying for two reasons. First, it gets extremely laggy sometimes for no apparent reason. Also, the AI is not fun to play against. The AI is extremely fast because it doesn't have to use the mouse. However, the AI is also really stupid, and it doesn't have a good strategy, even on the hardest difficulty. So, playing against the computer is not fun.\n",
      "If you want to get your computer to get broken or get a hard drive problem, get this game. This game was really fun and all, but after 2 months, it crashed my computer. I had to pay $150.00 dollar's to get it fixed. So if you DONT'T want to get your computer broken, Don't get the game.\n",
      "Flight Simulator 2002 is a good game but when you fly the planes you do nothing. You just end up crashing because theres  nothing to do in the game. One plane wont even get off the ground. I dont know why they put that plane in the game.\n",
      "City Crisis -- 0.85 starsCity Crisis is a total waste of money.  poor graphics and sound, downright horrid control.  You fly helicopters around, recuing people from buildings and following criminals in high-speed pursuits.  I will say that it is an original idea.\n",
      "Flying a Helicopter around and saving people never seemed any fun to me. It would have been better if it was a car game I think.\n",
      "City Crisis is a helicopter simulation where you put out fires and rescue people from buildings.  You can also use the helicopter to illuminate fleeing criminals with the night sun.  Unfortunately, the game has horrible graphics and even worse game play, and the missions are redundant.  I'm just glad I rented it and didn't waste more money buying it.\n",
      "This game [stinks].  Don't buy it.  The graphics are par for a 64 bit system, not PS2.  The play control is beyond terrible.  There is no variation on the weather... it is always sunny and clear, and the missions are long-winded and stupid.  The music is annoying as well.  Don't waste the [money] even to rent it.\n",
      "Legends of Wrestling is not worth it at all. The game is very slow, the graphics are sub par but considering that this game is on the PS2 and XBOX, the graphics are mediocre at best. Also the gaemplay and control is awful.With fighting games like Tekken 4, MK Deadly Alliance and wrestling games like Smackdown SYM, this series really doesn't stand a chance because these games are faster, have better controls and the gameplay and replay value is great. I won't deny L of W has a lot of great names in it like George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele, Hulk Hogan, &quot;Superfly&quot; Jimmy Snuka and more but still, the names in this game can't hold the game up.If there was any indication that this was going to be a bad wrest;ong game, the fact that it's released by Akklaim and as most of you remember that Akklain also had the unfortunate mishaps of having their name attached to their last wrestling games WWF Attitude and ECW Hardcore Revolution. Honestly, Akklain lost the license to release games for a reason and there are 2 right there. Skip this one and if you're looking for a good wrestling game, check out the Smackdown series because you'll enjoy that much more.\n",
      "It's amazing to me how ACCLAIM can make a game like Warzone on the N64 and PS1 and make it a decent wrestling game. The only thing some people complained about was the controls being that of a Mortal Kombat style game, which they ignored and kept anyway when they release the games follow up of WWF Attitude. That game looked so promising and the graphics looked awesome, but once the previews where over the the released game was playable, it was possibly the biggest let down of wrestling fan gamers lives. They then lost the rights to the WWE franchise and picked up ECW, in which they pretty much did not update a thing, they just made the ECW arena and wrestlers and added a barbwire match, and that was it. It's a no wonder ACCLAIM are not legendary amongst wrestling games. So here they are, some years after their WWF and ECW release, and a promising new game excited fans called Wrestling Legends. It's gonna feature Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart, the Road Warriors and so many huge name legends... but what do we get? It's a revamped version of Attitude/ECW! Just with some graphical enhancements, and worse controls!I swear to you, if you have played Attitude, you will see how simmilar this game is in graphics and maneuverability. Everyone hated that your player wouldn't lock onto his target and start punching the air... well, here it is back again! This game may as well be called ACCLAMES ATTITDUE REVIVAL because it seems they are using the same pathetic coding they where using all those years back. I really don't get how other companies manage to make controls basic and smooth, but ACCLAIM always seem to stuff it up in just about every way possible. Moving around and connecting with hits have such bad targeting in this game, and moves, man, why is there so little amount of moves you can have with a wrestler? Seriously, you have about 10 to choose from in each match, and they decided to put an \"excitement\" meter in the game where the crowed react to seeing new moves you haven't done yet, and it drops when you repeat moves... ACCLAIM, why didnt you just give people the choice to be able to actually do a lot of moves, instead of use the same old c@ppy programming you used for ATTITUDE where you kept doing the same moves over and over again because others where useless or got blocked all the time, and you expect people to be forgiving and not notice that all you did was reduced the move abilities and added a meter to say, \"hey, try doing a different move that the controller is too stiff on to be able to execute\"Ah Acclame, you haven't done it again.I don't particularly ever want to turn this game on ever again. So I can't tell you how many matches there are, or what options you can do, because after 5 matches fighting the same guys in career mode, and winning the belt, I still was going back and forth between Texas and somewhere else doing ugly looking shows against the Von Eric family all the time... which I learned my lesson with previous ACCLAIM wrestling games to not bother finishing it, as ACCLAIM have no imagination when it comes to these sort of things, and you just do the same thing over and over a million times until you are presented with something boring like unlocking 1 wrestler, and having to do it over and over again with other wrestlers just to unlock them all... no thanks ACCLAME, not doing that ever again to be rewarded with nothing in the end, especially when it's so boring after an hours play, and you expect people to play it for days to weeks doing the same no variety matches? Forget it.\n",
      "I really hated this game for many reasons. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- uhhhhhh... (i guess the graphics are ok)Cons:- No freedom. There is a track you have to follow, but you have to do missions and kill people along the way. Doesn't really make sense.- No weapons. For a game with no freedom, like this one, you would think they would try to spice it up with some cool weapons or something. Nope. All you have is a machine gun and a regular gun.- I don't get why your car turns into a motorcycle when your life is low.- Controls are too complicated. While you are going really fast and trying to complete missions, you have to add more confusion switching your weapons. You would think only having two weapons, it would be easy to switch, but no.This game really doesn't deserve to be a Playstation Greatest Hit. Sorry if I offended any SpyHunter fans.\n",

      "IN a word, aweful.  Despite all the hype before it was released, this game is the pits.  Why?  The controlls are jerky and annoying, the camera gets stuck and lost, you cannot save during a board, the cutscenes are unintelligible, it is pointlessly hard--I must have spent 2 hours trying to jump on a railing to ring a bell the railing was right in front of me but since he hops, it is purely random, lastly THE GAME GETS CONSTANTLY STUCK-- for example, if you jump from under an island (and you spend most of your time swimming)you get stuck inside the graphic of the island, and there is no escape!!! And since you cannot save the game during a board, just at the end, if you get stuck on a puzzle, or trying to jump on a railing, or to keep from getting stuck in computer limbo, it is purely maddening!!!Instead, try Jak and Daxter (I am not a developer or in any way affiliated with any game company...etc..) The most fun I've had since I first played Spyro the Dragon!! WHen oh when is there going to be a new game for PS2....  I cannot recommend Jak and Daxter enough--everything this game gets wrong, it gets right.If you rented Frogger, you would stop playing after an hour.I'm sure there is a worse game for PS2, but I can't think of what it could be\n",
      "Not this!  If you are looking for a game.  Do not get this!  It has horrible controls and camera, lots frame-rate slowdown, extremely short, and it has a bad plot.  So if someone says they want or bought this game your reply should be not this!  The one good thing is there are 80+ characters.\n",
      "I fail to see how Konami could release such a terrible game.  Don't even think about renting it because you will want your money back.  It's terrible with a capital T.  It has the word bad written all over it.  Don't even bother to look at the cover, stay far away.\n",
      "After playing it for awhile, I realize all you get to do is play with cows and chickens, and a dog if your lucky.  What a boar.  The \"Harvest Land\" in this game is so small I  wonder where all the memory went to.  Your main goals are to bake goods, farm the land, then attempt to earn money that way, so you can buy something to give as a \"gift\" to some townsfolk fool.  This way the townspeople will give you clues to go on stupid little adventures to get to one of nine stupid little endings to the game.  Oh, and if you miss their birthday dont expect any help.  Save up enough money and you can buy a kitchen for your crappy little shack, whoopie!Im sure glad I could get $11 for this game when I sold it.  Thats the best part of the game, getting rid of it.\n",
      "I regret buying this game not because is bad game at allbut because in trying to free some some memory the system erased all my save game information on all my pS2 games and reformatted the memory card. the game seems to be a good game though.\n",
      "This game was alright but it wasn;t nearly as good as ANY of the other Harvest Moon games. Personally I hated it, and I'v been a Harvest Moon fan for quite some time. This game only gives you a sertain amount of time to complete. and then u start over again, with the same stuff u had... i'v \"saved the homeland\" as many times as you could and it didn;t seem to be/get any more interesting.\n",
      "back in the ps2 times i used to like playing this game but know  that i see it for what it is its very limited you don't have much to doand the day ends very very very quickly giving you no time to explorer the very small town your ini have a fishing net but i cant go fishing for along timethe graphic looked good and the music hooks you in but the expertise is just bad\n",
      "I was curious about this game. My brother loved the pc version and loads of people have been raving about in the reviews so I bought it for the PS2 eagerly opened it and started playing. I have to admit I didn't even get past the first level. The movement is horrible, I was expecting something as well done as Red Factions movement. The frame rate drops constantly. To put it another way, it felt like I was playing a first person shooter that predates Doom (for any of you who don't know, Doom was one of the first first person shooter games ever)or it seems like a first person shooter done on the original playstation. It seems like this port was half done and was relying on the popularity of the PC game to sell it. So as not to be totally negative I did think it was a cool story and that you could make decisions in the game that affected how the game progresses, but unfortunatly a game cannot be considered good just b/c the story is good. If you are still considering buying this half finished game, I'd suggest you rent it first or buy it for the PC (there are even adapters so you can use your PS2 controller with a PC now). If this were the first PS2 game I ever played I would have gotten a gamecube of xbox.\n",
      "So, this game, or more specifically its PC predecessor, is a masterpiece in the history of the genre.  At least, that's what people say.  I'll never know.  The controls on this version of Deus Ex were so complex and awkward that I found them frustrating, and, consequently, the game was a miserable experience.  I'm not much of a FPS player, but there is a huge difference between intuitive controls (e.g., Halo), which are possible in ANY game, regardless of the overall complexity of the in game actions and the completely awkward, counter-intuitive, and ultimately frustrating control scheme that defines the gameplay in the PS2 version of Deus Ex.  Are the controls an unavoidable result of its conversion from PC to console?  Probably not - plenty of other games have been ported and have still been wonderfully playable.  Oh well; it's a shame I'm missing what sounds like a really interesting game, but I have better things to do than spend hours training on and acclimating myself to a poorly designed control scheme.\n",
      "Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is a very bad first-person shooter. You can play single player offline or multiplayer online or with BOTS. I played offline, but I doubt that it makes much of a difference since SOF has many technical problems.This game is barely worth my time. Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 should have been beta tested, so it would not turn out this bad. This is simply of one the worst games currently out for the PS2. It is an insult to the pc version of Soldier of Fortune. The pc version had clean graphics, fast framerate and great sound effects. The PS2 version has none of those things. My biggest gripe about this version is the very crappy frame rate, it is pathetically bad! It has some of the worst graphics to date on the PS2! You'll see this strange folding effect on the screen; as if someone is tugging at it, because the graphics cannot keep up with the action on screen.Not only does it look horrible but the choppy frame rate will also affect your game play. If someone is shooting at you from the upper level and you want to aim your cross- hairs up, it takes a couple of seconds too long and then you are either dead or the enemy gets away. The aiming controls can barely catch up to the target in time and this is very frustrating.Just imagine an internet game with tons of &quot;LAG&quot;, and then you'll understand what I mean. The graphics and colors look muddy and drab (even the SNES games look better). Animation is jerky and the characters look strange when they run around shooting. SOF also had clipping problems; in some areas I spotted enemies because their arms or legs where showing through walls. Loading the game takes forever! You can go have a cup of coffee and it will still be on the loading screen! Then when SOF finally loads you'll be treated to every bad thing that a PS2 game can have wrong.The one good thing about the graphics was that it was able to keep the blood and gore from the pc version- you can still blow people's heads, arms and legs off. And I liked the fact that they included BOTS in multiplayer and you can play against them by yourself. Are the BOTS any good you ask? Well they have a tendancy to shoot you in the back very often and they seem to have better shooting accuracy than you, but they don't have any real strategy. They basically run and shoot a lot mindlessly. But the action is never exciting because of all the &quot;LAG&quot;.The frame rate is laughably bad (like a bad joke). Playing Single player is even less fun and I got ticked off by one of the levels where you ride on a moving train. My character got stuck in the railing a couple of times and the enemy cpu got me with a lot of cheap shots. I found a few other places where my character got stuck to a door and the enemy came and blew me away. That's just bad programming. If they had done a better job of beta testing SOF, this would not happen. The controlling is not bad but it needed to be more responsive (especially when aiming!)The sound of effects are weak and unrealistic. The sound of gun fire from each weapon is very inaccurate and sound cheap. The Shotgun sound is too loud for its own good. Grenade explosions also sound weak as do machine gun fire. However, the music is pretty good as are the screams from enemies when you blow them away.In conclusion SOF is plagued by everything that could go wrong in a game of this type and you are better off buying something else. I feel sorry for the people that buy this game and then they can't get their money back. So I hope they listen to me when I say this: Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is total junk. I suggest many other first person shooter games that are much better and enjoyable than SOF. Games like: &quot;Timesplitters 1 and 2&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, &quot;Red Faction 1 and 2&quot; &quot;James Bond Nightfire&quot;. Those games will leave Soldier of Fortune in the dust bin- where it rightfully belongs!\n",
      "I won't go into reviewing this game very long so I'll make it short.  This games graphics suck!  I have scene better graphics then this and this is from the PC I mean c'mon!  The graphics are terrible compared to the PC.I hated how bad the frame rate was and everything about the graphics were really really bad.The violence in this game are hardcore but the pc Version is better mainly cause of the graphics.I'm so glad I returned this I just couldn't handle the bad controls and graphics.  I mean I donno I just did NOT like the game compared to the PC version which is better.In short...Get the pc version1 out 5Lates\n",
      "Games, like every form of entertainment, are subjective so I would never tell anyone not to at least try something out.  I came really close this time.  Lets start with the load time--this practically cripples the game and makes the whole experience annoying.  The graphics, though not a big deal since really this game is for those into the CB series, did not impress me.  Movement of the characters has an annoyingly N64 like feel to it.  This was my second attempt at getting into the CB series and I think it will be my last.  Those into the series, which I am not, may find something appealing about it although I'm not sure what.\n",
      "My little brother is a Crash fan. Personally i hate Crash games, they are all the same. When the Wrath of Cortex came out, my little brother bought it. I played it with my brother and boy was i bored. It is the same thing, even the same graphics and it takes like 2 minutes to load! Don't buy it!\n",
      "When I was 13, I played this game and loved it. I tried it again at 25 and it did NOT age well. The storyline is so poor that it annoyed, the voice-acting and dialogue is so inauthentic that it is painful, and while Dante is still cool after all this time he is literally the only character I like.This game isn't so much write FOR teenagers as it sounds like it was written BY teenagers.\n",
      "Summary:This game is horribly unbalanced against the player.  And this makes playing it absolutely frustrating.  With poor story progression, there isn't much to make one want to put oneself through such a horrible experience.  BUT, it just might be worth your while if you like the visuals and gameplay style.  I'll admit I really enjoyed these aspects.  If only they were accented by the rest of the game...Reasons I like this game:1. Good graphics.2. Enjoyed the Resident Evil meets Shinobi style.Reasons I hate this game:1. Camera:  Generally fixed camera.  Always centered on player.  This is great.... except when you're in a corner, which you usually are.  Then the camera is facing the corner and not outwards, where you'll obviously be facing to attack oncoming enemies.  This camera may work for games like Resident Evil where you have plentiful healing items and where the enemies don't move freakishly fast, but both of these are major issues in this game.  I'll elaborate in reason 3.2. Difficulty:  I'm not your average gamer - I'm always adept at any game I play.  And I've spent probably as much time I've been progressing in this game retrying levels (7 hours-ish).  This is due in part because of the horrible retry system, which takes you all the way back to the beginning of the stage if you lose.  If you have a yellow orb, you can retry from the last door, BUT you lose all your equipment you used on your last try... why even call it a \"retry\" then?  If you failed with the equipment, you'll fail without it.  Other than this, the enemies movements are just too erratic and fast.  No matter how much I get these enemies' strategies down, their attacks are still insanely difficult to dodge.  And the enemy strength doesn't help - a regular enemy can take off half of your health bar with a single attack.  Major problems for this: you are only allowed ONE potion item.  And health drops are VERY sparse and VERY weak.  This makes bosses particularly difficult.3. Upgrades:  This game has a very nice upgrading system that allows the player to pick and choose what is desired.  The problem is that most of the upgrades to weapons aren't very useful, yet they're outrageously costly.  It will take you days if you want to grind the cost to gain all of the upgrades/items you want.  And enemies are sparse for grinding.4. Controls:  There is a button to switch melee weapons, but no button to switch guns.  Even worse, when you do switch melee weapons, an animation will be performed making you vulnerable to attacks.  So you're forced to do it the old-fashioned way by opening the start menu and taking half a minute re-equipping your desired gear.  This makes battles very slow where you need to switch weapons because of enemy elemental properties.  Not to mention it just becomes tiresome after the 30th time.5. Story:  Started strong, ended horrible.  It's like the whole Inuyasha series smashed into 7 hours.  Imagine all the filler...  Well, the story is interesting at the beginning, though not much is explained.  But after that, it seems like they just pieced together backstories to all the stages.  Example, there's a tiny story (of about 3 lines of text long) about some item you need to get.  Game done.  But seriously... these kind of stories are what you're treated to most in this game.  Very sparsely is the gameplay ever tied to the main character's story.6. Music:  Repetative and generic.  Same battle music is repeated over and over throughout the entire game.  This music is VERY basic and VERY stereotypical action rock music.7. Platforming:  This game is by far the worst platformer I've ever played.  Half of the time you can't see where you're jumping because of the camera as stated before.  The other half when you can see is still riddled with problems.  You can't always grip onto platforms or the character just fails to, which is immediately annoying.  But even worse it is so difficult to land exactly on top of some platforms.  Platforming is not intuitive in this game AT ALL.  Some jumps are performed automatically when you jump from certain ledges that require a longer jump, and some jumps you have complete control over.  Which jump is the one you'll be doing?  Who knows!!  There is no way of telling.  Most jumps have some sort of automatic contol, where you are in partial control and are partly guided.  This is so necessary, because of the lame platforming in this game, BUT this is also very problematic.  Since you are only in partial control, your character makes unordinary jumps.  This is very tricky for two reasons: (1) the partial automatic control sucks, you will miss your jump often, and (2) its hard to determine which jumps you can make because you don't know exactly how the jump will react.8. Fanbase:  I bought this game because of the heavy embrace by a very large audience.  This leaves one to wonder.... why?  It leaves me to worry about my human kin, and their interest in this outright annoying game.\n",
      "this game starts out ok, then later becomes plain stupid. no plot at all, you don't know why you need to do this, why you have to go there, where should you go next. sure the action is fun until you face the annoying cat-like shadow creatures. i was literally wishing death to whoever designed these enemy while i was battling them. there are also secret missions which are nearly impossible to do. did they even test this game before they released it? don't buy this crap, get onimusha 2 or 3 instead.\n",
      "I am a long time fan of Capcom's Mega Man X series, owning almost all of them, excluding the rare X3, which I only rented, and the new PSX2 Mega Man X7. Mega Man X-X3 on the SNES where just great, and Mega Man X4 was \"mind-blowing\" great.However, a strange thing started to happen, and it happened when X5 came out. X5 was decent, but the storyline became too far-fetched and anyone with a brain could tear holes in it. This is even way more apparent in X6.Now we have X6, and I'm just gonna flat out and say it is probably (well, actually) the worst in the series, no doubt. It is easy to tell this game was doomed from the beginning...Here are my basic arguments:#1. No English voice actors for cut scenes or battle cries! - this is just SO unforgivable, Mega Man is as much a US game icon as a Japanese icon, this a royal slap in the face compared to the awesome cut scenes in X4. Capcom obviously didn't want to spend the money - lazy, pure laziness.#2. The whole \"Zero's missing/return\" thing was so dumb. Capcom built this scenario up so much in X5 and X6 and failed to deliver any kind of interesting and credible reason for his return. I could write a better storyline, man!#3. Zero's new sword is just way too powerful, it shreds anything in seconds, like his crescent weapon in X5. Basically, he has no need to use the weapons he acquired at all, you're gonna kick butt with practically no effort at all, meaning no actual challenge.#4. Ok, I know some people are sick of Sigma, and yeah, it's unimaginative to put him in again, after building up the whole \"Dr. Wily\" thing in X5, but Gate was ten times worse. Gate and Isoc were lame enemies. You never even get to fight Isoc either!#5. The way you have to defeat High Max was so annoying and over complicated.#6. The so called \"nightmare system\" is really a nightmare. When I read about it, it sounded cool, but really doesn't add any challenge as it does controller-throwing frustration.#7. Zero's control scheme is now so screwed up; it leads to many \"accidental\" deaths, because the buttons have more than one command assigned to some of them.#8. The English translation (or attempted translation) is horrid, the worst I've seen since Breath of Fire II. How do misspell the hero's name Zerrrrrrrrrrro! as Zelllllllllo!#9. X6 easily has the worst selection of Mavericks (this time called \"investigators\") Come on! When you have a \"dung beetle\" as a boss, you know you have run out of ideas and a beating a dead horse! Some investigators are pathetically easy, others are insanely hard. And I though X5's Guns and Roses theme was bad.#10. Overall, the stages lack anykind of imagination. Some are way too short (the Weapon Lab), some are way too intense (Weapon Lab, Magma Area), and some are just annoying to no end (Central Museum and Laser Institute).#11. They butchered the animation for Zero's victory pose - no more thumbs up.#12. When I first heard that X would be able to access Zero's saber as a weapon I was a getty as a school girl, until I played and found out he can't wield it even half as fast as Zero could; let alone combo with it, making it almost completely worthless.In the end, Capcom did do a few things right. Some of the tunes are cool, especially the two they remixed from X and X2 (although some are really terrible, ex. Central Museum), and some of the new armors are cool (I loved the Ninja Armor!).It's a sad day for X fans, I never though I have to bash a Mega Man game this harshly. But what do you expect when they slapped it together so quickly ...\n",
      "One of my biggest dissapointments ever. Now I have never played the playstation version, so I can not compare the two, but this game was horrible.You start out in a small town, its being attacked by some evil family. So some chick turns you all to stone so you will not die, then she attacks this guy. All of a sudden your back in the huge building, and some guy says go on a quest. So you leave for no reason and have no info as to who you are, except you are part of the dragon clan. You go to the first town and you kill some dude in a castle. Now the king tells you \"You are awesome!\", and tells you to go to some town and find the quake control to stop the earthquakes. Not only was this task stupid, I do not even know why I did it, because I got no reward. Also, couldn't the king have sent his men to clear out the castle? So you go to the town at night and sneak in past the guards. Keep in mind you have not said one thing at all during the game. You kill a knight and turn off the quake control. Now you go back to the king and he says \"You rock again! I am too lazy to give you anything so your a hero, now leave!\". Then you go to some town and you learn the king is ill. So you play as Nina to go to some other place and get a remedy from a wizard. How did they know the wizard had a remedy? Then you get sent to help Nina kill him. Back at the castle, the king gets up and Nina says \"I am going with Ryu because I need to stop evil in the world\". So then you leave. Notice you have done 3 quests and got nothing but Nina.Not only do you have no info about who you are, you are given weird tasks that give you nothing in the end. I am still not sure anyone knows my name. This game is overrated. Also, there are too many random battles. You cannot walk 10 steps withouht having to fight some weak monster. Now if you want an RPG on the game boy advance, get Golden Sun. If you want an RPG that serves no purpose and seems like people made up as they created it, get Breath of Fire.\n",
      "There's a reason this game is so cheap ( i found it for about $10-15)It's a terrible game! Now, I almost never say that about games (most have something redeeming in it) but I am a die-hard Tetris Fan-Girl, and I found it, quite frankly, embarressing!Just we're clear, this versian is for the GBA.I picked it up, because I was excited to see that someone had finally made a color tetris game. When I turned it on, I noticed several things which disappointed me right off the bat.There are several modes of play in this game, and only one which is \"Plain-vanilla\" tetris. Most of the modes are fun for a time, but only the classic tetris is even worth playing.There are a few redeeming factors, but overall, being able to switch out your next piece (and \"Hold\" a favorite), and FINALLY being able to \"quick drop\" your piece instead of waiting as it drops, does not make up for the forgiving difficulty and distracting colors and backgrouds of theis game.Several things prompted me to rate it so low.One, there is no score-saving. Heck, there isn't any way to score the game at all! What fun is it when you can't even brag about your high score?Two, the \"infinate rotate\" feature made it so you can continue to rotate a piece endlessly until you figured out where you wanted to set it.Three, the \"shadow block\" makes it so that you can see where you your piece will drop. Makes the game too easy.Those three items have effectively \"broken\" tetris for me! I promptly took the game back and requested a refund. Avoid this versian of tetris at all costs! If you must have a tetris fix, it's possible to findthe original for the gameboy under $10. (Even if it does stick out of your gba sp two inches!Don't mess with the successful tetris formula!Until a new versian comes out that addresses these issues, I'm sticking with my gb tetris!\n",
      "the worst tetris game ever next to the tetris worlds on all 3 major systems  lets face it finding nemo was by(thq)tetris worlds is by(thq)and i can go on and on  thq makes some of the worst games i have ever played stay away from them.the graphics suck the game doesnt even have a save feature to save your scores and its hard 2 play when stuff gets in your way when your tryin to drop peices its horrible\n",
      "It's hard to believe that someone could make a version of Tetris that I wouldn't want to play, but here it is.Here are the problems:1.  The animated backgrounds.  This is a killer.  Everything on screen is trying to distract you from playing the game.  Just a static image on the sides would have been great.2.  The spin bug.  You can rotate a piece once it hits the bottom as often as you hit the button.  This means you can just keep spinning a piece around until you need to drop it.  No challenge.3.  No battery.  A huge part of the game was trying to beat your old scores.  Also this means you can't save settings.4.  Far too permissive default settings.  You get to see the next 3 pieces, and see an outline where the piece should go.  Want to change the settings?  You can, but you can't save it, so you have to do this *every time* you play the game.Everything about this game feels wrong.  The floating cube head mascot, the annoying backgrounds, and the lame attempts to change the gameplay.  I still use my copy of Tetris DX instead!  I just wish I could get a copy of Tetris DX in a gameboy advance cartridge, as it sticks out of my gameboy advance sp.Stay away from this game.  Hopefully the next Tetris will bring back the classic DX version, which was the best version of Tetris ever made, for any platform.\n",
      "I have seen a lot better basketball games from EA sports. I have played this game and cant find 1 good thing about it. The camera angles are just plain horrible whilethe gameplay is just as bad.Every shot you take is a rim ball. No swishes or shots off the backboard. I dont know about you but ill wait till nba 2k2 comes out in February. EA sports should be ashamed of themslves.\n",
      "I've been a big fan of most of EA Sport's titles throughout the years and this one is a huge disappointment. I love their new NHL hockey and the NCAA football, but his game's quality is questionable at best. In last year's version the had great graphics and good gameplay . . . but only half the cars on the track; a concern for some. I thought it to be entertaining. This year, at the expense of gameplay and graphics, they have a full pack of cars. But the end result is terrible. Inacurate handling of the cars and chippy (at best) game rate where the grandstands click by as if is was a PS one game. I owned it for two days trying to find some worth in it but, alas, could find no redeeming qualities in it and I sold it to someone who has a PS2 but no TV . . . the best way to enjoy it if you want to own it.\n",
      "I'm sorry, I cant slap on the kudos that the other Syphon Filter die hards did for this version. I thought Syphon Filter 1 was the best console game available when it came out, Period. Really good first person action and controls that were superbly responsive.Syphon Filter 2 came on 2 CDs and was truly massive with lots of well thought out sections and excellent challenges.Syphon Filter 3 is exactly what I said it is. A series of OK to Lame leftovers they didn't think were worth including in 1 and 2.In case you didn't know, the company that produced one and two sold out before three and it is completely obvious that the people who cludged together 3 were using the leftovers.One and two broke a lot of new ground and the increased scale of two alone justifies it, but 3 does nothing new and is kind of like one of those Death Wish 13 movies. They really should have stopped at two in this case. This even came in a 2 cd box (with only one CD and a lame little meaningless pamphlet)They obviously had more planned, but decided just to exploit Syphon Filter fans instead, [taking money] out of them before they learned the truth.Sorry Guys, your first two were great, but this one is pure financial exploitation.MGS2 on the PS2 is intriguing, but really wordy and a little strained in the control department even if you don't like true first person as much as I do.However, Halo on the Xbox is the new best console shooter, Period!Played through Heroic level, hard but great fun. Legendary is continuous Suicide, also Period.If you like shooters, it is time to move on.\n",
      "I purchased this game because I'd played the original Jade Cocoon and liked it.  I'd already read reviews about Jade Cocoon 2, so I knew it wouldn't be like the original.  Still, I never expected it to be so bad.  I wasn't even able to finish the game.  I even picked it up again (after awhile of inactivity) to try to force myself to finish it, but I couldn't.  I really did consider finishing it to see if it got any better, but after reading numerous reviews/faqs/wikipedia, I realized that it wasn't going to get better.  So, rather than trudge through the rest of this abysmal game, I decided that I'd better quit before I wasted any more of my life.  I don't normally write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I really feel like I need to share my opinion on this one so I can inform others of what they might be getting into if they buy this game.  It's really not any one thing alone that makes this game unbearable; it's a combination of several things that bogs it down.  Well, let's take a look...Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics themselves are technically decent, but not really too impressive.Music (score 4/10): Ouch. Music is incredibly bland and generic. I almost didn't notice that there was music.  The voice actors try their best to invigorate the terrible dialogue, but many fail.  Furthermore, some voices chosen for characters were incredibly irritating--especially the voice of that guy who stores items for you.Characters (score 4/10): Remember how I mentioned the crummy dialogue earlier?  Well, this really ruins the characters.  Dialogue is VERY repetitive (a lot like the rest of this game).  Kahu repeats every statement made to him back in the form of a question.  \"Kahu, you need to get the forest orbs.\" --\"So, I need to get the forest orbs?\"  Urg!  This sort of exchange happens constantly.  Kahu seems to be amazingly stupid.  While other characters are amusing in a small way (like Yamu) it doesn't save this section from a poor score since most everyone is either gratuitously stupid or simply poorly developed.Story (score 2/10): Talk about non-existent.  What little story that exists is incredibly trite.  Kahu wants to become a beast hunter but then he gets cursed for touching a fairy cocoon.  Now he must collect 4 forest orbs to lift the curse.  There are several subplots along the way, but none of them are particularly interesting.  The story really suffers from the pace of it (slow) and the way it's told.  The bits of story are revealed by talking to people in the dungeons.  Sometimes there is a scene (mostly monologues by the fairy Nico), but mostly it consists of simply exchanging a conversation.  There wouldn't be anything wrong with this if it were paced better.  But the game drags on and on forever, with a lot of level grinding.  This really slows the story to a snail's pace and makes you forget why you are even playing this game.  With all this you'd think the gameplay made up for it, right? Well, let's see.Battle System (score 5/10): This part's not so bad, but it does have its irritating bits.  Selecting attacks is turn-based, and battle involves having several monsters arranged on a wheel surrounding Kahu.  They can only carry one move for each element, and then can only use the move of the element that they are placed on in the wheel.  Furthermore, you can't choose which enemy the monster attacks--it's random.  Plus, monsters can only use their moves that take up MP; they only use normal attacks once their MP runs out.  That makes for a frustrating experience. Otherwise, I would've been fine with the battle system.Gameplay (score 1/10): Repetitive is the word of the day.  There is only one \"town\" (and it's dull).  Dungeons are long and boring, and each one looks just like the others, only a different color.  There was just no variety--and in a game that's basically a dungeon-crawler, this is bad.  To make matters worse, the monster raising system is very unrewarding.  When you merge a monster, the appearance doesn't even change (unlike the original Jade Cocoon).  Further, monsters stop leveling up at level 20, forcing you to merge them, which resets their levels to 1.  This really ruins any sense of accomplishment you had, because monsters revert to their weak-looking baby forms. It really sucks the fun out of the game.Overall (score 2/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Sigh, the first couple hours of this game are really fun-- before you get sick of it, that is. I wasn't able to force myself to finish this game, and I don't see why I should have to.  A game is supposed to be for fun, not something I should force myself to do.  I just don't think I could recommend this game to anyone--except maybe the most diehard of dungeon-crawling fans.\n",
      "Aquanox is one of those games that makes you wonder if some game designers have any idea of what their competition is making.  It's like getting dressed without looking in the mirror.  I look at terrific games like Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, Half Life, or even The Sims and this game just can't hold a candle to them. (Probably because it takes place under WATER.) With all the time spent in my ship and never really going into the docking stations visited, I got downright claustrophobic.  Air!  Air!Pros:The graphics were nice.The game setting, underwater, is original.Cons:Horrible voice acting.The feeling that you are watching a filmstrip when the rest of the world is watching DVDs.\n",
      "Within the first few minutes of playing this game I was left saying \"What the hell ?!\" Mind you I can play a game with a stupid premise, but not a game with a stupid premise and crappy gameplay all in one place. If your an experienced gamer this game will only leave you pissed off because of bad gameplay, and poorly explained objectives, which only left me with the urge to punch the penguins that I already wanted to punch after watching Happy Feet. So remember folks if you enjoy fun things avoid this game and if you don't want to lose your soul to the suckage of this piece of garbage.\n",
      "I thought about buying this game. I'm glad that I didn't. My little brother let me borrow his copy of the game. I am glad that I played his copy before buying this piece of trash.It is a shame to rip off little kids like this.There is *~NO~* action at all. All SpongeBob does is jump around. Can we say a captail BOARING!! Don't waste your time or your money on this piece of trash.I love the SpongeBob game for Game Boy Color. I can't wate to try the SpongeBob game for PS2 (Playstation 2) and the GBA (Game Boy Advance). I bought my little brother SpongeBob for Game Boy Color and he let me play it I just LOVE it and I am not a fan of SPongeBob's. I don't watch the show. I will only watch it if my little brother is watching it.I would have given this game zero stars but that is not an option.\n",
      "This game is just like Crazy Taxi except done in the most horrific way possible...1 out of 5 stars!  This game had like no good gameplay except pick up people and drop em off and a very short story mode...Which is also crap...Nothing really to do except listening to annoying bad music which isn't even good and really really bad gameplay....Hit and Run is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better then this malarchy....1 out 5 HORRIBLE GAME!Lates..\n",
      "This is the worse PS2 game I've ever played.  The graphics are 3rd rate and are far below many PSOne games.The camera movement was so jerky that it hurt my eyes after about 5 minutes of play. My son and I stopped playing and never had an interest in playing again.There are much better games available like FFX.\n",
      "THPS2 was fun. The levels made sense, the physics were completely unreal (fun) and the locations had some sort of skatepark or something interesting going on. The locations in THPS3 are lacking. A few are fun, but the majority are chaotic and seem to be designed purely with aggravation in mind. The airport is a great example. The physics have changed for the worse. You feel like your controlling a big sack of lead, and you will fall constantly. The controls are not configurable, and the setup for doing tricks is more a game of hitting things in the correct sequence than any sort of creative use of the terrain. On the technical side, this is one of two PS2 games I've seen crash. Shipping a game that crashes is totally unacceptable, but this level of workmanship seems to be a major theme in THPS3. Overall I'm pretty annoyed with my purchase, and would recommend staying away from this title. Don't even waste your money on a rental. Hopefully some developer as talented as the SSX people will come out with a good skater.\n",
      "This game stinks. The graphics aren't that great and the control is terrible, making it hard to play. Activision should make a new game, instead of concentrating on Tony Hawk this, Tony Hawk that. Tony Hawk 1 and 2 are more enjoyable.\n",
      "Item was so damaged that it could even be repaired.Scratches were pretty deep and there is a crack on the end of the disk extending about one-eighth inch inward.Makes good wall art.So,I said well sometimes that happens when purchasing used stuff and decided to try again.The second one played fine until I reached the 14th mission(about half way through).Guess what...Hopefully this one can be repaired.\n",
      "Let's see what makes this a BAD game, shall we?1. &quot;Commentary&quot;A commentary is when two guys are sitting at a table near the ring, and talk about some stuff OTHER than the current match.  Tazz and Cole's so-called &quot;commentary&quot; is laughable and repeats the same phases.  Tazz and Cole are emotionless and sound like computers that need to find an acting coach.  They sound like this: There will be no interferring in the....single match.2. What the hell are they chewing on?!EVERY character in this game looks like they're chewing tobacco or something.3.  Auto-Lock, Please!I've played WWF No Mercy for the N64, and it had a clever little system.  Everytime you get it, your character would turn towards the character that hit you.  WWF Smackdown! doesn't have an auto-lock on.4. Create a CharacterOkay, this is one of the stupidest systems for creating a wrestler.  You don't get to pick any of the moves, just looks and clothing.5.  NO EASY SETTING!!WWF Smachdown! is HARD and doesn't appear to have a &quot;easy&quot; setting.  The computer is relentless and doesn't leave you alone to recover from the last attack.6. LOOKSSome characters don't look like the wrestlers in the real WWF.  For example, Stone Cold. 'nuff said.7. Nobody Talks!The only two who talk are the computerized voices of Tazz and Cole.All in all, this is the worst wrestling game ever made.\n",
      "I must say I am very disappointed in this game. For the PS2 they should have carried out their promises to the fans. Their storyline section is horrible. You have like 4 matches tops depending on what you pick as a storyline choices-Previous Smackdown games have a season mode where you can continuously play as a character as you unlock levels. Here you have to finish multiple storylines in order to unlock wrestlers and movie segments. Lame if you ask me. The Create a PPV is gone as well which is sad. I loved making those. You can't interfere during a wrestlers entrance. The only thing you have is improved graphics...Thats nice but for the PS2 there should be more. If you want to get a WWF game, buy Smackdown 2 for Playstation and enjoy !!!\n",
      "If you want a somewhat good wrestling game, consider ditching your junky PS2 and get a real game game console - XBOX! and get yourself WWF RAW, where there is at least some resemblence between the game models and the real wrestlers.\n",
      "WELL, THIS GAME AIN'T NOTHIN BUT A PS2 VERSION OF SMACKDOWN 2. AND THIS GAME AIN'T EVEN BETTER THAN THAT! THERE'S A LOT OF NEWER WWE WRESTLERS TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT THE GAME IS VERY UNINTERESTING, HAS BAD COMMENTARY DURING MATCHES, AND THE CONTROLS ARE STILL BAD. THIS IS THE WORST OF THE SMACKDOWN SERIES AND THIS WAS THE WWE'S PS2 DEBUT. THE GRAPHICS ARE ALSO PRETTY BAD TOO.\n",
      "I sold it back in 6 days with everything unlocked.  Story mode is a joke, no replay value at all.  I'll take my chances with Legends of Wrestling.\n",
      "Do not buy this. It sounds like a good price, but even for double the memory at half the price it would (be bad).  This is basically an 8MB memory card because in order to get the 16MB out of it, you have to compress and decompress every time you want to use it if you fill the card with memory.  And that's not the worst part.  EVERY time you put in a different disc, or hit reset, or turn the power from off to on, you have to insert the disc that comes with this card, let it load, pick your memory card, then eject, keeping the power on, and insert your game. If you don't do one of these steps, you have to start all over again because your game won't recognize that you have a memory card.  If you don't mind waiting 5 minutes every time you want to play a game, then this memory card works fine. But, come on, PS2 takes long enough to load a game already.  You don't need this.  A better purchase would be two 8MB card for ...more.  If I had been on the job when I first used this, I would have made that ...by the time I started my game anyway because it took me a couple of tries to wade through the obscure instructions.  One positive: if it seems you can never find the time to clip your toenails, this purchase may be for you.\n",
      "I recently bought a PS2. When I bought the console, I also purchased this 16MB memory card because it was cheap, had a lot of memory, and was the only one the store had at the time. When I got home, I put in 007 Agent Under Fire and the memory card. When I tried to play my game, the memory card wouldn't work. I printed some instructions from Interact's website, and I discovered that you had to use the disc that came with the memory card every time you wanted to turned off the PS2. I tried to get it to work, and it didn't work this time either. I took it back the next day and got my money back.This memory card is CRAP! I then bought a Sony-made 8MB memory card. Pay $5 more, and get the 8MB memory card. You can save without the hassle, and you can fit over 9 games to one card! Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!\n",
      "!WARNING!Do not buy this memory card. This memory card is a complete waste of your money. I would recomend Sony's 8mb memory card.So this reveiw is practicly just a warning.!WARNING!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!\n",
      "You must boot with the included software *every* time you want to play a game.  That [stinks].  Do not buy it because the lower price and additional memory are not worth the extra hassle!\n",
      ".I was in search of an inexpensive way to save my PS2 games to memory. As there were not many choices besides the InterAct memory card for the PS2, the advertising on the package looked very promising. Not only did you get twice the memory, you could also crunch the memory files down to a very small size, thus allowing you even more space to save more files.I purchased the InterAct 16MB Memory Card and it did not function as advertised.The unit comes with a custom memory card and a small CD the size of a GameCube disk. In order for the memory card to work, you must first load the software into the PS2. This takes you to the main menu. The choices on this menu allow you to select copying functions, crunch functions (making your files smaller by using a compressing program), moving files from one card to another and deleting.When I first started up the program, everything seemed to work correctly while saving to the card. When trying to load this data back from the memory card, I received an error message on the screen saying that the InterAct card was not recognized. I tried loading for 30 minutes and followed the directions exactly. I thought that I had a bad unit so I returned the item for a new InterAct 16MB card. The second unit was in new packaging, so I thought, \"Ah, they must have fixed whatever was wrong with it...\"Wrong. Same results. The card device did not work. However, after some detective work on the web, InterAct posted that if anyone had problems with the card, they would take your card and return a new functional one to you. Of course, this meant that you would have to pay for shipping to get a working model back...if it really works at all. No thanks.The units are all defective. I returned mine and received my money back. After several weeks, all the units were pulled from the shelves of the store I purchased it from, undoubtably, because of all the complaints and returns from customers.The 16MB InterAct Memory Card is non-functional and a waste of money.A one star rating is really too generous for this product as it is totally non-functional. If there was a way to grade it \"Zero Stars\", I would do so.\n",
      "Do not buy this Memory card because it is a stupid thrid party assery. It says it can hold 16MB of info because use can conpress the files. BUt the compressing is a pain. And to even use it on a game you have to put this special disk in. But when you put the disk in it shows you all of the files on the Memory card. Then the software is so stupid that you can't go to the game from it and have to restart. Then agin you have to put the disk in to use the memory card. DON'T BUY THIS MEMORY CARD. STAY WITH THE FIRST PARTY.\n",
      "Do NOT buy this memory card. I bought this card, and have paid the price. I talked with a SCEA representative. He said this product will damage your PS2 after just one use or many times of use. It damaged my PS2 in late July. I bought my product in Early April. I bought Star Wars Super Bombad Racing and it worked on a friend's PS2. But I used it on mine, and and odd noise popped up when I inserted the disc. It has done the same thing with 1/2 of my PS1 games. The representative said that the company has NOT licensed their product, and it has not been tested on the PS2. The representative said stick with the Sony cards, for they have been tested and approved on all PS2 games. Besides, you don't need 16MB of space. 8MB is fine. Do not buy Flash Memory 8MB either.\n",
      "... This memory card holds twice as much space as the official Sony card, but isn't worth it. It is a pain to use this. You have to load up a disc to use the card. It is annoying to have to keep loading up a disc when you want to play. With the Sony card, you don't need to load anything. This card is also very unreliable, because most of the time, it will, and I repeat will corrupt your game saves. If you were to buy this, I would only keep it as backup, never to use it. I would rather spend 50 dollars and gets 16 MB's of Sony than the Interact. Wait until Sony releases a bigger card. If you think about it, 8 MBs is a lot, when most of the games usually don't require more than 300 kb. You can definetely fit 25-30 games that aren't sports (Madden, NBA 2k2, All Star Baseball 2003, etc.). Sony's card is a must buy!\n",
      "This game requires that you insert software and go through a series of motions to start a game.  So basically, it turns a simple thing like turning on the PS2 into an annoying little exercise that requires you to babysit the console for at least a minues.  Of course, the box mentions nothing of this, and successfully hides the CD that you need place in you console at the start of the powercycle.  Worst of all, the package is designed in such a way that in order to even discover this, you'd have to tear apart the plastic box, making it impossible to return.Granted, it works, but it's just damn annoying.  Would you buy a car if it required you to crank start the vehicle?  Would you at least want to know about?  At least it's readily available, unlike other useful memory cards.  Of course the main selling point is that it contains 16MB of data.  Who cares?  Does anyone really use up all their 8MB memory card?Needless to say, the second I saw a Sony memory card, I grabbed that and never used this piece of garbage again.Even if you don't mind the extra annoyance of the loading time, you should NOT buy this product.  It will only encourage companies to deceive customers.\n",
      "Almost every night, I sit here and wonder why we have so many video games in the world.  What makes this game even worse is the fact that it really wants to be a Mario Kart game.  We already have Mario Kart, so this game is pointless.This game continues to get worse the more I play it.  Good luck trying to control your vehicle.  I was never able to do that.

This game is flawed in so many areas I can't think of anything good about this game. For one thing, it is way too simplistic, to the point of where it feels like the idiot's guide on how to play a video game. You'll mostly just spend your time upgrading you scare meter by collecting many, many potions. When you finally scare you subject it doesn't feel rewarding even after you collect all those potions, it just makes you angry that you wasted your time on this crappy game.

      "This game is a slap in the face of existing Heroes fans. What were the programmers thinking? It's an absolute debacle! First of all, the combat is ridiculous. There's no hex grids, no room for tactics, and the concept of having heroes in battle, unless they are very powerful, is absurd since they are easily killed. Laying seige to a castle is a complete joke, since there's no way you can knock down walls (the only way through is the gate) and there's these ridiculous pillars behind the walls that give a huge advantage to the player who owns the castle.What's really missing in this game is immersion, which existed in both Heroes 2 & 3 and made them such excellent games. Heroes 4 however feels empty for a number of reasons. Buildings are ridiculously expensive. There's no more 'wait until the end of the week' for new creatures - they replenish sporadically. You must CHOOSE between which armies you'd like to have populate your castle, eg, choosing Champions means you can't have Angels, and choosing Monks means you can't have Crusaders. There's no upgrades possible for units. You just get them and away you go.The hero system is stupid and biased. When you're weak you too easy to kill, wheny you're strong you're too hard to kill. Learning skills takes forever and even at level 25 you've only learned half of what you're able to. The game looks too flashy and the layout is way too complicated. So much for simple looking graphics - it's hard to see exactly what's going on now.Ultimately, Heroes 4 is a total disaster with so many things wrong with it there's no way a Heroes fan could possibly like it. As for people giving it 5 stars... they're probably just looking for 'helpful votes'. Listen to the rest of the people who have bagged this game and AVOID IT ENTIRELY!\n",

      "Okay, after a game has been in development for this long (3 years) you would expect it to be decent, right? Nope, not in this case.Ill get the good out of the way first. Its biggest strength is that the game is pretty. There are lots of cool explosions and some pretty spiffy bullet effects, all while running at a very smooth framerate. The control isin't too bad ethier for the Playstation2 controller, although not on par with Goldeneye's aim. There is also alot of variety in the gameplay, which is like a breath of fresh air every now and then.Now for the bad.  My biggest problem with the game is the enemy AI.  It's horrible. I mean really really awful. Poop on a stick is smarter than these guys. For example, one mission you go under cover, and your not supposed to be spotted.  So what do the guards do when they spot you? Look at you stupidly for a couple of seconds, fire a few shots, stand in front of the alarm for 30 seconds, THEN hit the alarm. Its like they are just asking you to make one clean shot in the head, its that bad. Never expect a real fight when you face one on one with them. Heck the only time it becomes a real challenge is when they are in numbers.Another problem, I beat the game in 6 hours. Yes, 6 freaking hours. As if the game wasn't easy enough, its over in a weekend of playing it. I am very glad I only rented the title, otherwise I would be seriously dissapointed with the game.And it's not like the multiplayer saves the day ethier.  It tries really hard to be like Goldeneye, only its a completely different engine, so it would have been wise to devise a new style of deathmatch, instead of trying to recreate Rare's masterpiece. The result is an easy, less tactical, and overall less fun multiplayer, with weak levels too. The \"autoaim\" makes the entire thing pointless , just to make sure there will be billions of cheap plays by your friends.The frequent loading times, annoying repition of the theme (it's not THAT great) and ... story (this wouldn't even work in a Bond movie) makes me wonder if EA can ever make a decent Bond game. It saddens me everyone else is so pysched about this game too. There are such better PS2 games out there, and to consider this one to be the \"best\" is a joke.\n",
      "This video game stank.  RPGs are generally plot/story-driven.  The plot on this story fizzled quickly.  The relationships between characters were not really developed.  Given how linear the play was, they could have taken some time to add something interesting.  In the end, I was playing just so I could be done, hoping that there was some fantastic ending.  Turns out the final boss was easier than other bosses and the ending sequence was just boring.  Save your money!\n",
      "There's really nothing special here--the music is irritating, the graphics are on par with Roly Poly Ollie (only not as inspired or amusing), the battle gameplay is not intuitive, there are no voices for the characters (only occasional narration), and the humor is abysmal (I sense they were going for a Pee-Wee's Playhouse/Rocky & Bullwinkle approach, but it just doesn't come off.)I don't mind having to go through some prep work before my first battle, but 45+ minutes is ridiculous--particularly if you're not given the opportunity to save before your first fight.  Yup, killed in the 3rd battle, never saw anything that would let the game be saved.  (This might something that was overlooked, but, well, it shouldn't be possible to overlook SAVING YOUR GAME, should it?)I understand that a part of the plot is that the main character (Ari is his default name) blends into people's shadows, but the way he interacts with the other characters in the set-up is ridiculous:  things he says are frequently ignored by other characters, and at one point your reply options are \"Yes,\" \"Yes,\" and \"Yes.\"  Why give me the illusion of control over my character if you're not going to respect the choices I make?Overall, very disappointing to me:  it seemed like it had potential, but, honestly, after dying over an hour into the game without ever being given a clear option to save, I had no desire to go through the bad jokes again.\n",
      "I Ordered this game,Promp Delivery!(2-3 Days).Then I opend it &amp; put it in.Low a Behold it was a &quot;Blue Back&quot; aka Cd-Rom. My PS2 Never plays &quot;Blue Backs&quot;,along with Hundreds if not thousands of other Folks!,(check the Web!).DVD Format Work Great!,any and all Silver backs are Fine!.Problem is You never know 'till it's opend!.Most Places won't take them back!,Or will let you exachange it for another!(Like,What good does that Do?).  With all that Said,I never Played it! ;-(\n",
      "This game is stupid theres no point or story to the game all you do is go around shooting alians and watching them blow up. Kids say the game rules when they havn't even played it. One question why is the game rated M and got best game of 2003 if it's so babyish? If you like this game your a big stupid idoit who likes chickens! THIS GAME SUCKS PLAY SONIC INSTED!\n",
      "This ame is terrible just terrible..it's just an average shooting game but only it has the WORST controls [it takes a joystick and a button to climb a ladder]..and the graphics are bad...it's just plain bad\n",
      "I dont think antone knows what the hell they're talking about. Halo is by far NOT the best shooter ever. It can be just as easily matched with Duke Nukem 64 for N64. Look, i have a gamecube, and if you want a real shooter, send your piece of crap X-BOX to hell and get a gamecube. X BOX sux X COX!!!! The only reason it even gets a 1 outa 5 is because it's a game!\n",
      "If you have played good shooting games this is not for you.  With limited weapons and vehicles as well as tiny multiplayer maps this game is ok but nothing makes in stand out.  You would be just as happy with any other new shooting game.  There really is no strategy what so ever it is straight forward shooting.  I would reccomend buying one of the battlefield games or planetside for experienced gamers.\n",
      "What is the big deal about Halo. It is one of the worst and stupidest games I have ever played. I think people like it because all you do is kill aliens that are extreamly stupid. In one mission you can kill like 100 alien things and you die 4 times. The aliens even speak english. How would a thing billions of miles away from earth know how to speak english. I think that is just stupid. Theres only like 10 weapons and 4 things you can ride in in the game.  In the game the warthog and earth cars can never break or explode but the alien stuff can. Another stupid thing is the missions are way too long. It takes abouut 1 hour to finish a mission. And once you die you come back to life. So anyone can beat the game. Some aleins have invisible shields on them and you have to waste a lot of ammo on them. All you can carry is two guns and grenades. And since theres only like 10 weapons you allways pick up the same gun. Theres only about 8 differnent kinds of aliens and they are all stupid. Hunters are big alien things that are almost impossible to kill, little stupid aliens that speak english and run away from you, little aliens with shields, big aliens that have invisible shields around them and they chase you, Floods that when you kill them little ball thing with no guns come out and jump and pop on you, theres more but they are mainly the same as the ones I just wrote but they are different colors or are bigger or smaller. If you like combat games dont buy this because all you do is kill dumb aleins. It is not hard at all. Dont buy it.\n",
      "... The game itself, while somewhat neat looking, was ridiculous. I felt like I was being attacked by hordes of MUPPETS, as that's what the enemies looked like. The weapons were all stupid and unrealistic...\n",
      "I used to like this game alot. Now that I don't like it anymore, I find it quite unusual how people worship it. There was alot of hype over this game when it came out, and it's probably the only reason why Xbox sales were doing so well back then. I've pretty much gone back to playing PC games and my Xbox has been collecting alot of dust lately. Actually, the reason why I hate this game now is because of my friends. They used to make fun of Halo, then somehow, the demonic entity known as Halo took over their minds, their bodies, and their souls. We played everyday. They took it way too seriously and I can't stand playing Halo with them anymore. I began to notice some bad things about Halo:-Everything about the game is way too childish. You play an invincible godlike character who just can't die thanks to his recharging shield and the powerups laying all over the place. The aliens are wimpy and cheesy. Plus there's an alien race that rips off John Carpentar's The Thing!!!!!!!-Most of the game levels look the same! There were some variety, but not enough.-Weapon names are too obvious. Quotes from people playing: &quot;Oh, I'm really good with the SNIPER RIFLE!&quot; &quot;SHOTGUNS are good when you want to fight somebody up close!&quot; &quot;You use the PISTOL way too much!&quot;-Vehicles were invincible. At least, the warthog and the tank was. How come most of the alien vehicles could be destroyed?There's alot of other things I could say about Halo. I believe there was too much hype when the game was just like any other first person shooter. What really destroyed Halo was when it was released for Xbox instead of for PC like it was intended too so it could boost Xbox sales. The game probably never even reached it's full potential thanks to the Xbox. The game doesn't even looked finished.The plot has way too much hope in it. Even though the human race is being annihilated by an alien race known as the Covenant, everything is hopeful because of the god you play as. At least with Half-Life, there was almost no hope because there was aliens as well as soldiers trying to kill you.Halo could have been a great game, but Xbox ruined it. PC version is not any better either.\n",
      "This isn't a game...it's an evil entity from you-know-where....it's come to take over the human race...and it's succeeding...it almost got me. I rented it, then realized within minutes that I was playing a clump of manure, not a \"superb and divine game experience\". I truly believed that RPGs saved me...if you find your psyche being taken over by this evil, feverish disease known as \"Halo\", quickly play FFVII or Chrono Cross. It's the only cure. And now, the evil entity has devised a way to clone itself. That's right, Halo 2 is upon us, and the foolish public still hasn't wised up. Run while you still can, dear reader. You may think you're too clever to be tricked by evil, but this is such a twisted machination that it even made Game Informer its mindless puppet. If you must have an FPS, buy Metroid Prime...Nintendo is the only savior from the demon-spawn that is Halo.\n",
      "This game could have been so good, if only you could tell which direction you're going. All the walls look the same. All the rooms look the same. Its all the same. Boring, with gunfire. Without a compass or map, how do you know if you've been there already? Oh, you don't. I realize this is a &#34;fun&#34; First Person Shooter, but the sameness of every room put me off FPS games forever.\n",
      "This game just plainly sucks. Whoever plays this game needs to find something else to do even if its to go down to the local park and pick up trash, thats how bad this game is. This game's realism is as low as anyone who plays it. The game itself lacks in every aspect of orginal concept. Everything from the weapons to stages, even the monsters are rub-offs from other shooters and cheap sci-fi flicks. This game has no realism again the concept is terrible and nothing is original. I am glad this game is only on x-box so the other systems wouldn't have to bare its embarassment. Whoever plays this game should second guess their actions and remember what their looking at. A cheaply put together game with annoying sci-fi gadgets and the most annoying looking costumes ever. If I were you I would settle with Doom 1 or even Wolfenstien. Don't bother buying this game if you do you'll be disappointed and embarassed. Make sure your friends don't see it ;)\n",
      "this game is not fullfilling the graphics are terrible and all you have to do it put in a simple code and you beat it...if you like racing games (which i dont) you will find this game frustrating and hard...for once in my lifetime I am telling you not to buy this xbox game...\n",
      "This game is not realistic racing you can barely turn if you are going over 10 miles per Hour around a curve which happens alot. And then you CAN'T EVEN CRASH you just bounce off the other car like it's a rubber ball. PLEASE Do not even rent this game unless you just love almost every racing game thats been made!!\n",
      "When I saw trailers for this game, something looked really fishy, and when I finally bought the game and played it myself, I found the problem. This game seems to have some serrious bugs having to do with the steering. Not only this, but the game is down right impossible, and you have to earn every conflabbed car! Also, when you earn &quot;kudos&quot; the game takes a while to process the information, and, finally, when your are done sliding or whatever, you start again, and if you hit a wall after that, a matter of seconds after you are DONE sliding, you will lose all of your earned kudos from that, and all of that hard work vanishes into dust. Also, back to the steering, the game seems to slip and slide very easily, even if you just tap the stick at 90 mph... the biggest complaint though is that this game was supposed to take ADVANTAGE of the system, with great graphics, this game is laggy, slow, and has terrible gameplay. Don't make the mistake that I did with this game. This is a horrible game on the xbox, and it makes me feel one more ounce of anger that the xbox couldn't shape up the games that came out on release. There have been many games so far on the xbox that have been eye candy. DON'T BUY THIS GAME! YOU WILL REGRET IT LATER!\n",
      "remember MSR for dreamcast.  Obviously not, if you cam to the buying screen.  It was an awkward racing game, boasting innovative ideas, that failed.  The graphics were nice, but the game wasn't fun.  I instintly was reminded of that game while reading about Project G.  Then i read it is the same development team.  ...\n",
      "Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.\n",
      "this game really [stinks]! who thought this game would rock? i hated it! i got my hopes up because it recieved so much hype. i talked to others that have played this game and they all said that they were turned of by it.overall, i think this game is boring. i actually liked the demo better that the actual game itself. i thought the worst thing about it is that you need soooo many power-ups to progress though the game (very time consuming).and one player mode is boring, maybe if there were at least a two player mode than it would be a lot better.words of advice! DON'T BUY IT!, EVEN IF IT IS ON SALE!, IF YOU ARE REALLY TEMPTED RENT IT!!!and the only reason i rated it a one is because the graphics are pretty cool!\n",
      "Halo is a much better game!  I started with Azurik, and it ws fun.  Then 20 minutes later I tried Halo, then MX2002, and 4 more games.  Azurik was way below my expectations.  This game is the least fun I have ever had.  Compared to other games, this is sooo dumb!  The storyline is just like Zelda, you gotta save some dumb planet from people.  The graphics are only good on the videos.  And I dont even want to START about the controls.  I reccomend renting this game, and spending your good $$$ on Halo.\n",
      "Azurik reminds me a little of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter from years ago, except the premise is far less interesting and the main character is blue. Yep, blue. One of those ridiculous-looking Japanese Anime characters with tattoos and whacked-out hair. Worse, he appears to be made of a stiff plastic which makes him move with the realism of a Barbie doll. Seriously, he marches up steep hills without a single knee flex!The textures are nice, but the animation quality in Azurik is very poor by today's standards. Those of you who are saying this game really showcases the Xbox should try a few more games. The music is a poor attempt at a movie score, and the creatures you have to battle are as dumb as posts. The birds that fly around are animated so badly that I burst out laughing. But worst of all, the controls in Azurik are so lame that you have to spend half your time and energy just managing (centering) the camera so you can see what's going on.The bottom line? This is Microsoft's worst Xbox game, and if I were the product manager I would have pulled the plug. Stick with the likes of Halo, Munch's Odyssee, Project Gotham Racing, Cel Damage, and any EA Sports game for state-of-the-art fun.\n",
      "Azurik's an interesting game. The elemental combination system that's at the heart of the game is an interesting one, and could have provided for some unique and creative puzzles, situations, and combat. However, in many respects, the game falls flat on its face.Combat, for one, as frequent as it is, is entirely uninteresting. A,A,A,B is the name of the game, and while you've got to make sure you're using the right elemental combinations, the lack of a reward for beating a monster (they respawn, you gain no experience, and often end up using more &quot;elemental fuel&quot; than you regain) is negligible.The game is billed as an action/adventure. Adventure games are generally about two things - seeing the sights, and solving some puzzles. The sights are a mix of good and bad. While there's clearly a lot of geometry up on the screen, it's not really put to good effect. Textures are detailed close up, but muddy from the distance you'd normally look at them from. Poor level-of-detail control. The level design is also often pointless, and very easy to get lost in due to the repetitive nature of the levels.Azurik's cardinal and unforgivable sin, however, is that there is no logic to the game. The puzzles are simply to find the pieces of the elemental discs, and their respective powers, and use them where you're told to. There are a few puzzles that actually require some thought, but even then, they're more illogical and trial-and-error based than not. Had there been any indication of where you might look to solve your current problem, the game would have been worlds better.Alas, the lack of logic in the puzzles and level designs, the poor floaty controls, the repetitive and boring combat, and the atrocious save system (yes, there's a save anywhere cheat. It can also permanently ruin your game, forcing you to start all over again if you use it wrong) make Azurik a pass for all but the most hardcore adventure gamers. But the problem, then, is that the hardcore have seen games much better than this.\n",
      "which do you like.  if you choose &quot;good,&quot; go to the order sheet for Maden 2002, or NFL 2k2, both going to the x-box.  This game focusses on graphics also found in the other options, but the others have perfect gameplay mechanics, judging by the similar games found on other systems.  Its you choice, good or bad.\n"

      "i have had this game for a long time and it was so horrible i didn`t even want to write a review on it, but then i thought other people would get the game thinking it will be good like the first one ( well i thought the first one was good). the game sounds great with 70+ cars and over 90 add on parts but they realy don`t do that much to the car's handleing. the grafics arn`t the best but they are ok. But one of the things that made me realy mad was they took ford out of the companys on the list for cars and they had some of the best cars for off road racing. it is impossible to win a race because the controlls are hard and the other cars seem to go at least 10 miles an hour faster than you even the exact same car. i have a cheat to get 1,000,000 dollars and you can`t buy those specialized racing cars without doing so many races even if you have the money and i put all of the most exspensive parts and the best parts to help me increase my speed but i still lost and i am very good at racing like on the first one and on other racing games. so i would not recomend this to any one at all.\n",
      "This game was an utter disappointment.  The music is absolutely terrible (possibly the worst of any video game).  And the graphics are retro looking.  Come on, with the power that the Xbox has I thought the graphics would be better.  The game is extremely difficult and is dull and lacks excitement.  The missions are all basically the same as eachother, which is to eliminate the enemy planes.  Don't run out and buy.  Rent it if you feel like it's something you'd like, but don't buy it unless you've rented and liked it.  I returned after the first day of having it.  My suggestion would be to buy a game worth the money, like Halo or Max Payne or anything but this.\n",
      "i really don't know what i can say about this game that is good. i waited so long for this to be released and them finally it comes out and there is no season mode  there is a lack of a good roster  characters like k-kwik and Haku are included but no RVD or BookerT or DDP no Alliance members at all except for those in the wwf prior to the invasion. the characters walk bowlegged like they just got released from a prison or something. come on this is microsoft cant you come up with something a little better even Smackdown just Bring it is ten times better than this and create a wrestler especialy [stinks] on this game  this game took long enoughto get out on the market  so why not pull it off the shelf and take a little more time and give us a game that is actually worth the wait and the money i feel ripped off and i just rented it for 4 bucks so i wonder how someone who buys it is going to feel. dont get me wrong i am a huge wrestling fan i have even been to a recent Pay per view  (no Mercy and it was awsome) so im not disliking this game cause its a wresling game i dislike it cause they spent way too long on it for it to turn out the way it did. hope this helps some of you out there\n",
      "After playing this game a while longer, I've decided that giving it the two star rating I gave it earlier was too generous on my part.  This game is bad on so many levels that I can't even address them all.Great graphics should not be the primary selling point of a  wrestling game.  Nor should grand entrances of the wrestlers.  To all the reviewers out there who are so easily impressed by the entrances - go watch a video of Raw or something.  WHO CARES WHAT THE ENTRANCE LOOKS LIKE WHEN THE GAME IS THIS BAD?I've seen some reviewers upset that there are no talking announcers on this game.  Hey, that's one of the few bright spots - I don't have to turn off some inane commentary that repeats itself over and over again.  WHO CARES ABOUT LISTENING TO ANNOUNCERS WHEN THE GAMEPLAY IS THIS BAD?This is supposed to be a wrestling game, not Mortal Kombat!  The matches are ridiculously short, and the characters move like robots.For the love of God, what would make THQ drop the development team from AKI and pick up an inferior group like Anchor?  They're almost as bad as the people from Yukes, who make those even worse wrestling games for the PS2.\n",
      "I own a lot of xbox games. This def. is the worst one! I guess some of the things in the game are considered cool by the younger crowd. However, if you are an older player (like myself... I'm in my twenties...), you def. won't like this one.I was NOT impressed by the graphics. As a software developer, I have to say that the xbox can do MUCH better. While you can recognize your characters, they certainly aren't life-like.But worst of all is the gameplay. In a tag-team match, my two opponents actually started to fight each other and one tried to actually pin the other! What a farce. When you hit people (there are way to few moves, btw...) and knock them to the ground, their bodies mysteriously slide around on their backs.I was hoping for a wrestling game that would rival games such as Dead or Alive 3. But this is a serious disappointment!\n",
      "A few words before i begin my review.Ignore my others for this game.These are the true facts.First of all the wrestlers.The faces look like bugs bunnys expression after he has the gun in his face in the hands of elma faud.Second of all, the lack of wrestlers.Now i'm not going to sit here all day naming the missing wrestlers but i can name two of the basic ones missing.Hulk Hogan.Booker T.THird of all, you cant climb ladders.What?You cant climb them but you can knock em out with themSame with the tables.Fourth of all, hers an example.I was the undertaker and kane against spike dudley and jeff hardy.I performed two chokeslams in a row followed by a wild ride or whatever his finisher his and the wrestler, (sha zam) popped right back up in a 4ourth of a second.My advice, if you 100% want this game rent it, any lower don't even waste 5 bucks.I am a huuuuuge wrestling fan and have played all the others and loved them but this was a dissssssssssssaaaaapppppooooooiiiiiiittttttmmmmmeeeeennnnnttt.\n",
      "WWF RAW is a perfect example of great packaging to mask a HORRIBLE GAME!!!!!This has to be the BIGGEST disappointment I have personally EVER had as a video game player/owner.  I had such monumental high hopes for it and it fell flat on EVERY level.Let's take a look and see how THQ dropped the ball...#1 - Possibly the worst Create-A-Wrestler ever!  Costumes, colors, faces, masks, are extremely limited (or else so goofy you'd never want to use them).  Games for the PSX and N64 completely dominate the pitful options here.  Forget trying to make any ECW, WCW, or super-hero characters!  You're limited to three skin colors and only 9 color options for clothing (no text additions on shirts either).#2 - Limited match options!  NO CAGE MATCH!  NO ROYAL RUMBLE!  NO SURVIVOR SERIES!  NO BLOOD!  NO LUMBERJACK!  Come on!!!!  Games like Warzone and Attitude for the PSX even had these options!  And correct me if I'm wrong, weren't some of these options supposedly offered when the game was being previewed?#3 - Confusing game play!  Although the moves and fighting style are nice, the camera angle shifts WAY too often to allow you to stay focused.#4 - Music and Save options!  Compare this game to the other Xbox offerings like Gotham City Racing (for the music) or Halo (for save and game options) and you'll be crying in your soup.  On a hard drive the size of the Xbox this game actually limits you in saving CAW and match options!  LIMITS the size of 16 wrestlers!  PHAW!I could go on and on about why I think this game is a titanic waste of time, money, and expectations but I won't.  THQ needs to take a good look at classic wrestling games like the PSX's WWF Attitude or N64's Wrestlemania 2000 because with their newest offering they have taken wrestling games back...A HUGE STEP!\n",
      "Yeah, it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst wrestling game ever made. The only good thing was the graphics. Royal Rumble on the Dreamcast was better than this display of cow ..., that's why I say the XBOX [stinks].... DOWN WITH THQ! You want real wrestling? I suggest you hang on tight for the Backyard Wrestling game cuz that's the only way you'll get the EXTREME! ...\n",

What kind of a reflection on our society is it that we produce a game which glorifies beating old people with bats, running over cops, and shooting cops.  I am not against violence per se, because we have all grown up playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers, pretending to have guns and shooting each other.  That has been going on since time immemorial, ever since it was cave dweller vs. bear.  Many games involve shooting or death, but usually you are on some kind of quest to save the world.  In this game, you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty.  I do not find this amusing or even \"funny.\"  After playing for a few hours, I felt dirty, as though I were committing evil.

For those with little hands this controller is absolutely out of the question.  You need a map to find all the buttons(obviously just kidding).  The controller is the source of your gameplaying skills and being chunky, well beng chunky aint good.  Another reason of the teribbelness9is that a word?0 is the shape and placement of the buttons.  i mean comeon oval?  The buttons are also stuck on the tippy top of the controller which(again) means that this will be tough for the little handed ones.

      "this controller [stinks] big time. the buttons are small and poorly located, after 15 minutes your hands get sweaty and sore.\n",
      "(...) this horrible controller would I think stop most people from getting Xbox, it's very fat and hard to find the right buttons, the d-pad feels like hard lumpy potatoes and is hard for non-veterans to use. Just all the buttons feel like they're in the wrong spot. It could of worked if it wasn't so weird.\n",
      "It's too big, The button layout [stinks], and it looks really stupid.  Better luck next time Micro$oft.\n",
      "that stupid contorller is soo big, it wont fit anywhere.  trust me like my review on the system, you dont want it.  stick with computers microsoft.\n",
      "Why 1 star? Because you need it. Otherwise you can not use DVDs on your X-Box.  I do not understand how Microsoft can release such a simple remote.  This isn't a remote control, it's a toy that belongs with the likes of Little Tikes.  Remote controls represent manhood, this item represents Happy Meals.Look at Sony's &quot;official&quot; remote control for the PS2.  Look at the button options.  Why did Microsoft feel that they should produce such a simple product? Onscreen menus instead of button selections?I feel cheated.  I even called the X-Box help desk and inquired about a good remote control and was treated with: &quot;That is the final product.  There will be no other option.  Maybe a second generation company will produce one you are satisfied with.&quot;\n",
      "OK, you can watch DVD's on the XBox. But, did we tell you that you had to buy another gadget to unlock that feature? NO!!! You can slap in a CD, and a nice little onscreen menu pops up that you can use the game controller to use. But, you have to go buy something else if you want to watch a DVD....  Also, it won't scan into a song.  I have a CD with some VERY long songs.  I want to get to the middle of the song, and not hear the whole thing, but I can't.  Also needs an off button very badly.\n",
      "NOT FOR XBOX 360! This product is not for the 360 and it would have cost me more to ship it back than it cost. I was very disappointing and I have no use for this. I probably will give it to Gamestop or Goodwill. Waste of money. I specifically searched for Xbox 360 receiver and this came up first. This is not for the xbox 360.\n",
      "Pros: NoneCons: Bad GraphicsBoring GameplayMoney System guarentees you'll be broke unless you stick to th tightest budget possible.[It's just like] Roller Coaster TycoonUnecaseraly HardMore furnishing animals cages and keeping them happy than running a zooPrice is overdown this plays like [a]game out off a bargain boxWith in 25% hour of playing it you'll start to loose intrest\n",
      "Before I start, I would like to state that I am a die-hard EA fan... especially for their sports games.  & in addition I think that the NHL series is the best sports series ever.  The games for genesis were ground-breaking & the computer games perfected the realistic feel.  That said, this is the WORST NHL hockey game i have ever played & i've played every single one (so i'm a video game nut).  The game is virtually ruined by the slow gamepace.  the players skate very slowly, especially when they have the puck.  if you have a breakaway, you can bet that someone will hack you down (or just kind of skate around you) before you get close to the goalie.  So considering that the defense skates twice as fast as the offense you would think that you may get some nice checks & physical gameplay... wrong!  the checking is mild & unrealistic.  It doesn't even account for momentum.  This means that a standing check is just as devastating as a check where you have a running head start.  Even the original NHL back in '92 accounted for this.  As a final gripe, the players aren't accurately rated, something EA is usually good at.\n",
      "Basically not much difference in this version or the PS2.  High sky-hook shots from the post is the biggest downfall.  Slow play on the advanced level makes a baller play on stater just for excitement.  NBA2K is much better becuase at least you get a few real game steals by jumpming, Live has none of that.  For true Vets, Live lost it when 2k hit the scene.  Don't get stuck with games like this, 100.\n",
      "Zero fun.  Graphics are very marginal for powerful Xbox's capabilities.  Run from this one, and wait one more year on hoops game.\n",
      "Sure,I liked Hydro Thunder on N64 but this is TO MUCH!!! I must say WaveRace:BlueStorm is a better buy on a better buy system!\n",
      "&quot;Horrible game&quot; is not enough to express how boring this game is.You can't see the characters when they fight, there is no visual flair to the spells, and the enemy movements are weak and minimal. Oh, and there is no actual plot, its non-linear. Too bad. I guess I'll go back to watching for the Dragonball Z game for GBA.\n",
      "Bah, I found Dragon Warrior 7 seriously lacking in all aspects and wish I would have rented it Before I bought it. I stuck with it for about five or six hours, and when the game still failed to interest me, I gave up. The fighting is just as boring as the storyline, and the plot seems to fall out of no where into your lap with little explanation as to how the son of a fisherman would be best buds with the Prince. Furthermore, there's just no excuse for those horrible graphics, other then laziness. The cut scenes don't even have a small bit of sound, like walking or a rock slate being slid open. I'm all for games that focus on storyline before graphics, but this one dropped the ball in Both areas. This game seems to be one either you love or you hate, from the mix reviews I've seen, so I'd encourage you to try out a friends copy first unless you know and love the series.\n",
      "This game is gorgeous, and the perspective is unique and fantastic.  Unfortunately, some controls do not translate as well from computer mouse (or gamepad) to PS2 as they could.I had such high hopes for this game, but I am just not able to use both analog joysticks, the L1/2 and R1/2 buttons, and the button pad at the same time.  Call me uncoordinated (despite the fact that I have been playing video games since before there were home video game systems!), but I don't want to give myself carpal tunnel syndrome from playing a game!I would also like to state that &quot;bullet-time&quot; was a neat style of visual effect in the Matrix.  It is not something I want to see in shooting games in the future, as it just adds a level of implausibility to an otherwise realistic game.\n",
      "This game in my opinion is terrible.  Though I must admit it did have probably the most stable MMORPG launch of all time, that still doesnt fix the actual problems with the game.  First off leveling in the game is rather easy, and I'm sure there already people that have achieved level 50.  Second, pvp is supposed to be a big deal in the game, but because the classes are so unbalanced it makes most pvp battles unfair.  The game also lacks in visual quality of the graphics.  Yes the graphics are nice, but they definitely do not compare to Anarchy Online's graphics.  This is just a wanna be Everquest, that failed in my opinion.  If you want a good MMORPG I suggest Anarchy Online or Everquest.\n",
      "I waited for months for this game to come out and when i actually got it I almost threw up at the poor graphics and the awful voice acting. the story can't be that great but I would not know as I sold it after playing it for ten minutes. There are not 300 job classes you can make your own however. I really doubt anyone who hadn't played the pc version was expecting this! and afterplaying this you will realize that it is all hype!RENT IT if you are really interested!\n",
      "The biggest problem with this game: it can create problems with your Xbox!  Apparently, it saves progress in such a way that it can start to crash frequently.  I've read some online stories of people who have had to have their Xbox repaired after using this, so be careful.The other downside is that it is just plain boring.  You can walk and walk and walk with little action.In it's defense, it is the only game I've seen with such a big and open-ended world.  There is simply a huge amount of terrain you can wander around, with a huge amount of freedom to do whatever you want (kill monsters, steal stuff, find food, buy things...)\n",
      "Man, i was really wanting to play this game for a long time. I thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome. But then i played the game and realized i am way too stupid for it. Yeah, i didnt know what i was doin. I figure that too enoy this game youve gotta be some kinda hardest of hardcore rpg player that understands this stuff. An average person will get confused to death by this. A lot of people have a different view and know exactly what they are doing, they are who this game is for. Newbies, step away, far away.\n",
      "Unfortunately, that's not very long.  A splendid game made all but unplayable by bugs and crashes.  Get the PC version.\n",
      "FIrst off, the game itself is great, but not good enough to warrant purchasing the Xbox version, after hours of play the game will crash continually until the point you can't move through certain citys without it locking up and you havent to wait through extremely long load times to get back.  Do yourslef a favor and pick up the pc version instead.This is not issue just experienced by me, apparantly the xbox runs out of memory and when loading a new area the game locks up taking forever, however if you don't beat everything and constantly make new characters you shouldn't run into problems.Play at your own risk.\n",
      "If you've ever played the final fantacy series (ESPECIALLY the latest one) you will be very, very disappointed.The game playes in a limited area and revolves around solving puzzles. So far so good, but the load time between scenes is horribly long and annoying. I'm a gamer and I could sit hours and play a good game, but this one puts me to sleep after an hour! Every turn you make, you enter a new scene (remember there are limited number of scenes to start with) and you'll have to stare into a black \"now loading\" screen for up to 7 seconds.I don't recommend it for anyone over 12.\n",
      "I rented this game to play with my girlfriend.  After watching the uninspiring cut scenes, which could have been done on a Super NES, we were ready for the boating action.  Unfortunately the deathmatch and storyline games are both so bleak and repetitive this game would qualify as the first shareware Xbox game, except it costs as much as a quality game like Halo.  After a few games, I returned it straight to Blockbuster, even though there were still three days left on the rental.  I'm really glad I bought SSX Tricky just after I rented Blood Wake.\n",
      "This is the absolute worst game i have ever played.Pros1. Nice water graphicsCons1.Bullets are tiny and orange so you can't tell if you shot or not2.All you do is shoot stuff3.It takes a million shots to kill another boat4.It's just plain boringNote: DONT play this game! Do yourself a favor and stay far far away!\n",
      "o.k. its called blood wake wheres the blood and a 7 yr old could beat this game easily I should know I watched one play this game sucks\n",
      "THPS is so much fun, and it has infinate replay value, so this should too, right?  Sadly, no.  Only 2 tricks are customizeable, but that's not the problem.  No one has ever heard of any of the guys, except maybe the &quot;Slim Jim&quot; mascot, but characters' names don't matter, either.  So what is the problem?  SPEED.  Think about it, in THPS, you start out fast, you recover fast, and you never really slow down.  In this, you go slow until you hit a hill, take 20 minutes to get up, and once you stop--you take your sweet time speeding up again.  (Ever ride an actual single-speed bike? Hard to pedal, right?  Espescially up hills.  Same here, you pedal like crazy and go nowhere. [But you get there fast!])  Seriously, pre-order THPS3 and steer clear of this.\n",
      "The Graphics are are worse than N64.  The game is boring beyond anything I've ever played.  The controls don't make any sense.  Highly recommend buying something else.\n",
      "I don't have this game, i only played it at a few stores. I beat a couple bosses and got bored of it right after that. I would expect this game to have come out on the NES and it still would have been a bad game. the plot is boring and repetative, and there aren't any twists to the story - suck up a ghost, beat up a boss ghost, suck up more, beat up another boss ghost...Plus, it's a lot like Blinx: The Time Sweeper (Xbox) and that's a way better game.\n",
      "As a long time fan of the Super Mario series, I have seldom, if ever, been disappointed by any games in the entire series, from Donkey Kong (and I do mean the original arcade game that started it all) all the way to Super Mario 64. Given Nintendo's track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new GameCube platform, I had every reason to think that \"Luigi's Mansion\", even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors, would be a quality entry in the series. I have to say that I was sorely disappointed.I have a certain level of tolerance for games, even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding, but I ran out of patience with this game. I could barely even get into playing it. From the very beginning, this game gets annoying. When Luigi first enters the mansion, he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give Luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion. Yet, the idiotic professor rambles for about 10 minutes worth of dialogue and THERE IS NO WAY TO BYPASS IT!! After each brief piece of dialogue, you have to hit a button to make it continue, too. So you just can't do something else while he rambles. But, I digress. You would think that once you get past that annoyance, you could just get right into the game. WRONG! Learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating. The game doesn't give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it THAT STUPID PROFESSOR STARTS YAPPING AGAIN!!! This, alone, caused me to put the game aside for about 8 months before trying it again. Once I finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness, I figured I would finally be able get into the game. Once again, I was wrong. I find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board. I had the strategy guide and could very well have looked up how to open these locked doors, but at this point, I was just too frustrated to care anymore. I put the game down for the last time...\n",
      "At first i was looking forward for this game ' but when i got it i was disapointed heres whyProsSound 0/10 terrible music sound terrible voice acting (e gadd's voice)Gameplay 0/10 the levels are very hard and confusingControls 0/10 they are difficult to use when you are trying to suck up the ghost in that vaccumBut if youre a fan of challange then this is the game for you ; but if you cant stand the frausration then you know what i meant by my review\n",
      "ALL MY FRIENDS TOLD ME THIS GAME IS A LOT OF FUN SO I PUT IT ON MY CHRISTMAS LIST.WHEN I PLAYED IT I THOUGHT IT STUNK!IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.NOTE TO NINTENDO:NEVER EVER GIVE LUIGI HIS OWN GAME AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Luigi's Mansion is a definite no-no!  The controls on the game [are weak], it is completely boring, and the storyline is too original.  When Luigi enters the mansion, it's nothing but cleaning a dusty old house!  This game is very boring because there is nothing to do on it...\n",
      "Let's face the truth: Luigi's Mansion isn't a video game at all, but a demo of the GCN's capabilities.  It sure does a great job of showing off everything the system can do, but that's NOT what a game is supposed to accomplish.  Ooh, big fancy pretty graphics, I'm so freakin impressed!  The gameplay is downright TERRIBLE.And let's not forget that it commits the worst faux pas of the Mario series: an earthbound protagonist!  How DARE they publish a Mario game in which you can't jump??  It's unthinkable, I tell you.\n",
      "This game is stupid and childish If your like Michael Heim Grow up nintendo is for babys and mommas boys get the PS2 or Xbox Those have better games.P.S dont you notice how 99.9% of all the games for the GCN are rated E and only one good game is rated M get the picture boys grow up.\n",
      "... I rented this game because of other reviews but the graphics aren't that great. The graphics are like Super Mario 64. The buttons are so darn confusing. Once I tried to seperate my pikmin in colours and they all ran away. The Game is to short it's a game that most people would beat in one day. The story line is Your rocket gets hit by an asteroid and you land on a weird planet. Your oxygen supplie will only last you 30 pikmin days. You lost thirty parts of your ship that spread out all over the pikmin world. One pikmin day is like 15 minutes so that means you only get 450 minutes of gameplay! One other thing If you use all 30 days and you've only found 29 or less parts you die and have to start a new game. You don't even fight you don't controll the pikmin. You just stand there while they kill the bad guy ( boring ). If you don't believe me still don't buy the game just rent it you'll see.\n",
      "Never have I seen a game more engulfed in &quot;Miyamoto's Curse&quot;, a term I use to describe Shigeru Miyamoto's recent trend of mediocrity in his design.  In fact, I'm beginning to wonder what happened: his early work was so fantastic, yet this is so... not.The problem with Pikmin (the problem being Miyamoto's Curse) is too big a focus on innovation, so big that no room is left for anything else.  The team that designed Pikmin completely forgot to make sure it was any fun to play!  They didn't even care!  All that mattered to them, it seems, was that their final product be innovative, unique, and full of fancy gimmicks never seen before.  And while such things are indeed fine and good (I should know; I myself am a game designer/programmer), they alone can never make a good video game.It looks as if all of Pikmin's levels were designed over the course of two or three days.  The attention given to them is PITIFUL.  I'll grant you that the engine is quite impressive, but so what?  It means nothing to me as a gamer.  (As a programmer, however, I'm very intriged, and I sure would love to see the source code.  It's a shame Nintendo doesn't believe in the open source movement, eh?)So since most people playing Pikmin aren't programmers, I'm guessing they'll get nearly nothing out of it.  (Nothing but eye-candy, anyway.)\n",
      "This game, although somewhat fun with 4 people has a terrible single player mode and fight physics that rival that of my grandmother. Hardcore fighting fans must steer clear from this abomination of a game. Inevitably once you get 4 friends over to play the game does become fun, but then surely gets repetitive. As you play for a week you master it without any real skill involved and in the end your just said you spent 50 bucks on a mediocre party game.Don't buy unless your have a 6 year old kid who has 3 friends following him around.\n",
      "super smash bros was a dissapointing game there was no storyline what so ever once you beat everything there was nothing more to do.Damn i wished the producers would put more places and characters in the game.\n",
      "Graphics are terrible. this game is boring and the game play is so bad it's not worth playing. do not play this! also Allen Poe is a sick man! this game is not scary at all! RE4 however. scared me. it was amazing gameplay this game however isn't I would not play this again. skip it!\n",
      "Not going to lie I was not a fan at all. Its like weird resident evil type play but so much harder to follow the story or even know what you should even be doing half of the time.\n",
      "First of all this game is way too hard(on the 3rd leverl for godssakes) and you dont care whether the character lives or dies.I like games that are challenging like Zelda and Metroid but to have something be really difficult on the 3rd level is just ridiculous.Youre much better off with Resident Evil if you want a good game that is rated M.Im so glad I rented this thing instead of bought it.I already want to return it its so horrible.\n",
      "...This game is absolutely horrible.  The playabilty is poor and the graphics are barely mediocre.  Don't waste your money ...\n",
      "The reviews said this is good, but I must've missed something in the tutorial. I thought the soldiers were supposed to fire on their own? It's very realistic, but I apparently failed to get the fun of the game.If anyone can advise me on this, please comment.\n",
      "I have all the rainbow six games, and I think this is a stumbling attempt to create a battlefiel war game. I think it was stupid of Ubi and Red Storm to put somthing this pitiful out there with operation flashpoint out... Its good if you like the rainbow six series, but if you want somthing a little better, go for operation flashpoint.\n",
      "Got this game for me and my nephew, but we couldn't install it on Windows 8. I got it to run by running xp in a virtual desktop and it worked fine.  However, no matter what type of compliance we ran in W8 it just wouldn't even install, but it wasn't meant to I don't guess...no big deal though...I just need to read before jumping on to buy next time. Someone else mentioned it in comments...so now I am a commenter fan.\n",
      "Unlike Rogue Spear and Urban Operations, which were developed by the very talented people at Red Storm Entertainment, Black Thorn was developed by a team of UbiSoft employees in their Montreal office who were trained by people from RSE, but who obviously lack their talent. The level design, modelling, and particularly the texturing were second-rate and amateurish, and doesn't compare to the quality of RSE's work on the previous installments in the Rainbow Six/Rogue Spear series.If you are a fan of Red Storm Entertainment's work then it might be worth buying for the bonus CD (American version only) that contains a feature on the making of Ghost Recon, but don't expect Black Thorn to be on par with Red Storm Entertainment's previous work in Rogue Spear or Urban Operations, or even Covert Operations for that matter. If it weren't for the bonus CD about Ghost Recon, I would have returned it and asked for my money back, it's that bad.Contrary to the rave reviews that UbiSoft employees have been posting around the net posing as fans and customers, Black Thorn is by far the worst in the series - hardly &quot;the best&quot; as they have been claiming.\n",
      "I see many other reviews raving about the graphics.  They're right.  Stunning.  But to use an analogy - A beautiful woman with a poor personality, makes for a lousy date.  This Star Wars games is very beautiful, but poor personality.  FLAW: This game is just too hard.  Remember the Star Wars scene where Luke loops rope around Walkers?  It's in the game, but insanely difficult.  It took me about 30 attempts.  Not fun.Then I went against some shield & planet base. 10 minutes of boredom cruising through asteroids, followed by 1 minute of insane punishment by killer guns.  Dead.  Repeat 10 more minutes of asteroid boredom. Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Argh.  Then I had to kill a Star Destroyer!  One tiny fighter against a Destroyer?!?!?  Nuts.  6 hours later & about 100 attempts, I just barely beat it with about 1% life left.  It was frustrating, NOT fun.  Now I'm on some planet where I get killed off in about 3 minutes.  I've repeated this level another 50 times already, and I made some progress, but I'm not enjoying the time wasted.  Isn't that what gaming's about?  FUN?  Well, this ain't.I'm dumping this game.  Frankly, I'd rather go replay Colony Wars or Starfox or Elite.  They may not look as pretty, but they make for better dates.  All were challenging w/o making you feel like a hampster stuck in an infinite rolling wheel.  And they were FUN.\n",
      "okay i like nintendo but its just gettin old i mean at E3 they showed a new game called DDR well its new because it has mario in it they copy great games and turns them into crappy versions.But anyways the game cube is okay it just needs to be more less childish.\n",

      "I own an Xbox but decided to get a Gamecube just to play some of the Mario titles and some other exclusive titles to Gamecube. All the games which I bought are all fantastic, and provide endless fun. However, the system itself leaves ALOT to be desired. I always thought of the Gamecube as the worst of the current three consoles, but actually owning one made me realise its one of the worst consoles ever. The Xbox Controller S is one of the best controllers ever, and the PS2 controller isn't so bad...but the Gamecube controller is horrific. Never have I seen or held such a terrible controller. It feels totally wrong and looks even worse. The original controller's cord is also terribly short. The startup screen for the system and the menu screen are also disgusting, especially when you compare them to a system like the Xbox. The system can't play DVDs or audio cds, unlike the other two competitors. Every extra capability must be purchased as an addon. There are only two memory card slots compared to Xbox's two slots PER controller. Even the power cord sucks, with its large adapter. There are a few positive points however, such as the very compact size of the system, the nice, small size of the Gamecube discs and standard 4 controller ports. However, these small extras don't make up for the absolute nonsense the actual system is. The exclusive games, however, are fantastic and make the system worth it. After all, games are why you buy a gaming system. This review was only an assessment of the actual hardware.\n",
      "I did receive the unit on time, and wrote a short statement on prompt service, giving five stars. However, I doubt the Gamecube was &#34;new&#34; as advertised when I opened the package. The unit smelled like cigarette smoke, and the controller looked as it had been used. When I received my game a few days later, I noticed the left analog stick on the controller was broken. 8-bit Attic is guilty of false advertising. Please avoid this vendor.\n",
      "What happened to Nintendo? It was a good, fun and wonderul time with Donkey Kong and other Nintendo game systems in the arcade, the legendary Nintendo Entertainment System, the SNES, but when 3D games has began, not everything from Nintendo feels the same. The fun atmosphere of games are fading, and Mario was less \"kiddy\" when he was 2D. Now Nintendo is fading and the fad has sadly gone. GameCube is like a childish system, and where did the good times go? Down the drain! We'll never have those moments again; so sad!\n",
      "Why can nintendo just grow up and realize that normal people today only play games like GTA and Halo and not their gay kiddy games. Nintendo needs to realize that their gaycube was a flop and become like PS2 and Xbox. Games like mario and donkey kong are only for whipped kids of hypocritical evanangicals.Gta and company are for hip and open mined people\n",
      "I'm still VERY upset!I bought this console because I got tired of playing my gamecube games on my Wii system so I figured I'd be better off using it's original console. Just as I was looking for a replacement console I found a &#34;Like-New&#34; Condition for only $33.00 I thought it was too good to be true. So I went with it.And as soon as it came to me I started trying to play it right away and guess what? This cheesy junk hardware couldn't read discs! I was so mad that I demanded a refund and I shipped it back ASAP and what's worse? Damn seller wouldn't refund my money! So if you're reading this, DO NOT BUY from &#34;Tyler Teal!&#34;\n",

That means 59 blocks should be only $1.32415e-4 = $0.0001324Wow so Nintendo is actually making 755101% profit by charging at $1.00.\n",

      "I have never heard of this game, my boyfriend convinced me in buying it. It looked like a fun game and i found it at a game store for $3, so why not. Biggest mistake i ever made i am glad i only spent $3 on it. It was so dull and boring. You practically do nothing. i wanted to give it 0 stars but it wouldn't let me. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! even if it's really cheap don't buy it.\n",

      "I was hoping for another great stratagy game that I could add to my large collection of PC games. I usually love Stratagey games, but this game is an exception. The game is very buggy and feels cheesy. For example, when you try to click on something, it takes many clicks before it gets the messgage. And no it isn't lag.I forced myself to play it for several hours thinking that if I gave it a chance, I'd learn to like it, but I just hated it more an more with every waking moment. This game reminds me of a much downgraded civilization 2. Trust me. There a many good stratagey games out there. This just isn't one of them.\n",
      "This might be your choice console, because it was designed, courted by, and made for kids. With the excception of the Resident Evil series on the horizon, there is not much to look forward to if you are over fourteen years old.The one thing Nintendo has going for it are its franchise game series such as Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc. If it weren't for those, then Nintendo would most likely cease to exist.I wouldn't recommend getting any console right now except for the Microsoft X-Box. While I am no MS hound, I will say that if you are looking for longevity in a game console, that would be it, because with a Giant like Microsoft backing a console (finally, American competition again!) with a huge array of ported PC games, a hard drive, DVD player, and the best looking graphics on any system (Gamecube could not handle half of Halo's world because it has no hard drive), I would go with X-Box... But if you want fun for the kids, get a Gamecube\n",
      "I hate this game! It's not worth the [money] that went down thetoilet when I bought this, it's a horrible game, even worst thanIwo Jima, and that's pretty bad.The graphics suck, the gameplay is horrible, if you shoot a badguy, you're kicked out of the SWAT organiztion, oh, yeah, and oneshot kills, which really blows. The AI is the worst from ANY game, and that's as low as you can go, if I tell a team member topick a lock, it takes him five minutes to do so, the controls arehorrible, worst than Max Payne, and those are pretty bad. Take myadvice, don't buy this, don't even waste five bucks on renting it, if a unfortunate freind bought this, don't even borrow his. It's just not worth installing it.Minus zero stars.Don't buy this, Iwo Jima's even a better pick.Hope this warning helped, only get it if you're a SWAT member,it's just too hard, too complicated with horrible graphics and gameplay.\n",

I was surprised that they would release a game these days which was such a poor quality of graphics and design. It looks more like a mock up of idea's for the castlevania SOTN rather than it's own game. Dont waste time with this one.\n",
      "This game really wore on my nerves; on my last nerve, if the truth must be known. Fine, I will admit that the graphics are decent and the story so-so, but the game play--THE most important element of video games, people--is complete garbage. I haven't been this disappointed since playing Blood Omen 2. Camera angles are awful, tending to work against you (okay, in this respect, I'll try and be fair: when it comes to camera angles, most games, nowadays, could use some major improvements). In my defense, I've played enough platformers to know the difference between a challenge and a chore. This game was a hassle from start to finish, an absolute waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy either game from the Ratchet and Clank series. They are ten times more user friendly, and a hundred times more entertaining. Oh, yes, and just so you know, I beat this hunk of junk in a day.\n",

The gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating. What a worthless game!I totally love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way. Batman: Vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever. I really must stress how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color schemes fool you. I've seen better stuff on a Commodore 64.\n",

The cut scenes like racing and flying the helicopter are next to impossible with the controls one bad turn and you get the I failed message, and you have to start all over again.6.  Lack of being able to save at any point.Other than that it's great, Ha ha.If you want a Great Gaming experience trade this game in for  Halo, Max Payne, or Blood Omen 2 Even it it takes 3 for 1.\n",
      "This game stinks on all 3 systems (4 if you count GBA). There is more jumping around than fighting. And the fighting is just punching. So the whole game is jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, punch, punch, punch, jump, jump, etc. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n",
      "This is the cable that comes with every new X-Box. Whoever designed this cable should be beaten with a large bag of Swedish Fish. I guess they failed to realize that some people would like to connect the Video (yellow) cable to their Television and the Audio (Red and White) to their stereo/surround receiver. Too bad the 3 plugs are fused together leaving about 2 inches to spare between each one. With all the time spent designing this console, you would think SOMEONE would realize it's not a good idea to force the plugs together.I would seriously give this cable a Zero star if it would let me.

The gameplay (MORE LIKE LAMEPLAY IN THIS CASE) is the most important factor. Well that's another story.. it's just so lame. LAME LAME LAME!! WHAT A HORRIBLE GAME GAME GAME!!, & WHAT A SHAME SHAME SHAME... This is as bad as getting a fruit cake for Christmas. This game does get an award though, The award for worse game of the year.

      "Don't plan on it. It is bad. You will be in a bland environment, with graphics made for the N64, then you will be in a story that doesn't involve you or anyone! Awesome! Not only is there no motivation, but there is a boring game!Take for example, save points. To save you have to leave, to leave you have to find an item or WALK back. When you learn about team attacks from this dude, he tells you all the different things then you try them. There is one that took me 3 hours to beat. It is called team defence. Every turn, 16 goblins would run at my guys, one time I tried attacking the goblins, but died horribly and had to redo my hour long work. Ok so then I tried again. This time when I did team defence, my girl would get lucky sometimes and hit something. it literally took me 2 hours just to do that battle. 3 hours because of the losing it and walking back.Cons:-The game costs money-Battles are repetitive-The environments are stupid. It is blocks. All blocks.-You hit up, down, left, and right to do everything.-The town is all text and stuff, there isn't any walking around.-The game has such poor graphics that are some of the most boring and uninspired environments ever conceived in a game.-The atari has better graphics than this gamePros:-The game is hard to find-You get a receipt for buying it\n",

      "I sure expected a lot more from this game than what it offers. The game itself is ok but the graphics are terrible. This game was obviously not built from the ground up to take advantage of the Xbox. Rather, Lucas just took an existing graphics engine and packaged it as a new game. I'm suprised that Microsoft allowed this game to be one of the early Xbox titles. With so many other games that have good gameplay and fantastic graphics, I just don't understand why this one was released except as a fill in until other Star Wars games come out. With the power of the Xbox this game could have been fantastic if it was built to be a top notch game like Halo. Instead we are left with a ok game and 1995 type graphics for the same money that a game such as Halo costs.\n",
      "I am going to reveal the ending, so do not read ahead if you still want to play this game.Many others have already posted their opinions here, so I will not go through the whole game in detail.But as many others have said, the voice-acting for the Obi-Wan character is ridiculously, unintentionally humorous -- the actor sounds like a guy with a head cold trying to imitate Ewan McGregor doing Obi-Wan, exaggerating the distinctive traits McGregor's Scottish accent -- so even lilts in his voice are thrown into hyperdrive. (as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept. gave to Qui-Gon Jinn -- yes, the bridge on Liam Neeson's nose may be somewhat big, but since when did he have Karl Malden's nose?)The game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department -- sometimes you can't see features on faces.But onto the ending. The game is fun, with a handful of challenging levels -- mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind high-powered laser cannons.But it's marred by a disappointingly quick and all-too-easy ending. The moment arrives -- you finally meet Darth Maul. Just like in the movie, you stand behind the laser wall and watch as Qui-Gon is struck down by Maul.And finally the wall opens, you hold your breath, ready for a tough battle -- one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out. But it's not to be.Darth Maul is ridiculously easy to defeat. I beat him on my first try and in less than a minute. And you have to fight him twice -- as once you take him down the first time, he gets a new, full meter of health. So in less than a minute, I drew down two full health meters. I felt cheated, to say the least.I remember fighting against Mace Windu to have to reach the next level, and I had to go toe to toe against him some 20 to 30 times before I finally beat him. I was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty, but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game. All I had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and Maul was done.How in the world could the game's makers create such a lackluster, lifeless, no-threat ending battle? I was left extremely wanting, and if it were a movie, I would have angrily asked for my money back. I cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was. Even more now, the Darth Maul character cries out for a game of his own. One can only wish -- for this Maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fight.\n",
      "I was looking forward to a complete packing of MK for GBA, but the controls and gameplay was horrible.  Very hard to execute moves and it was way too easy for the CPU opponent to sweep you into oblivion.

      "I buy EGM alot and I read all their reviews but somethingcaught my eye. Mortal Kombat Advance got a O.O out of 10.I read the review of it and began to laugh one reviewer quoted,\"Mortal Kombat is a stinking pile of bloody dog krap!\"While another quoted, \"I'd rather be locked in solitaryconfinment while gargling cat piss.\" Ignor reviewer one, Ido not reccomend this to anyone this game is crap, WARNING:DO NOT PLAY should be stuck to the box case.....hooorrible\n",
      "Mortal Kombat perfected itself when it brought out the MK Trilogy on Pc and PSX. But before that, the SNES had great games of MK 1, 2 & 3 and then buggered up the trilogy for the N64.Now that the power of the SNES can be made into a hand held console, you'd think the GBA version of the original style of MK would rock, right? Wrong.What the hell have they made here????A GBA is supposed to be a hand held SNES, yet the SNES game never was as slow as this game, the graphics where not as bad (backgrounds are image's) the moves where executable with ease on the SNES and yet this version it takes 2 or 3 tries to get something to work because the response of the game is not fast enough!!! and the worst thing is the feel of it, you cant beat the computer with ease, everything you do gets blocked, the computer all of a sudden goes on a rampage kicking your butt and you cant do anything about it.Plus, where the hell is Johnny Cage, Goro but most important of all Raiden??? You cant have a MK game without Raiden.To screw it up even worse, it's a 2 button game now!!! no more jp,lp,lk,hk,b & r...nope, just k & p... press back+K for a roundhouse kick, press down+back+kick for a sweep... that probably would have been ok to get used to if the bloody response of it actually worked... i have to slow down my button pressing so the computer can execute the moves which sucks to high heaven.I didn't even get a fatality off, there is no one button fatality code. I played this with a gameshark and needed the infinite health code on. You even need the gameshark to unlock Shoakahn, Montoro and Human Smoke because to access them you have to beat the game then get to use them for one round. WHY THE HELL GO BACKWARDS FROM THE TRILOGY? It's a serious down step and it's the worst Mortal Kombat i've ever played. It even makes me like the 64's version better with it's less characters and no one button fatality cheat that every other version had.This is the worst MK game ever. Dont buy it, it's slow, it doesn't have the right feel, the response sucks, the computer blocks everything, there is hardly a cheat worth looking at, the backgrounds suck.... there is nothing good to say about this game.Please, if you do like this game, it's probably because you have never played any of the other MK's before. So, go and find an MK game on any other system and find out why I am saying what I am saying about this version, and you will agree with me 100% when you play the GBA version again and it runs so slow and boring and nothing goes right.\n",
      "Mortal Kombat Advance was released years ago, but as long as the game remains on the market, people should be warned of the utter disgrace of a title they may one day consider.  If you're reading this because that day has come, heed my words closely: There is no legitimate reason to buy Mortal Kombat Advance.  None.Midway was once well-known as a failure in making handheld versions of their popular, arcade-quality titles.  Mortal Kombat Advance is one of these.  The game is filled with bugs, making the easiest difficulty as ridiculous as it is inconsistant, then almost impossible on any difficulty from the default up.  If you're still playing the game after a half-hour or so, it's probably to figure out how to beat anyone in the higher difficulty levels; simply put, it isn't.  The game just wasn't made well enough to offer fair play against CPU, and if that's all you've got for play options, then your experience is going to be the worst possible.The rest of MKA's elements are a mixed bag.  The graphics are standard for classic Mortal Kombat games, but the animation is subpar, giving it the air a bad SNES port.  The same goes for sound, which is minimal, and music, which is poor if even existent.  There really isn't anything for this game to fall back on; not only is it shamefully unimpressive in its gameplay, but it's an embarrassment to hear and see, too.The only thing this game is even remotely good for is two-player combat.  There are over 20 \"Kombatants,\" giving players plenty of characters to keep things mixed up.  Not having to deal with the AI is a plus, but the bugs make it difficult to execute moves; consequently, fights are reduced to button-mashing and desperate attempts to pull off combos and special moves, which may or may not even work.  This too may ultimately leave you frustrated, especially since the prospect of playing two-player meant TWO copies of this game were purchased; that's simply two too many.Midway has learned its lesson since releasing Mortal Kombat Advance, releasing far better titles in MK: Deadly Alliance and MK Tournament Edition.  Again, if you're even considering Mortal Kombat Advance, do yourself a favor and don't.  There are plenty of better options out there.\n",
      "Alright. I had no idea what to expect from Mortal Kombat Advance. I loved the series from MK1 to its fourth game on the N64 and Playstation. Then there's this....Okay...Maybe I should mention that I loved the CONSOLE GAMES. The only handheld game I like in the series is Mortal Kombat 2 for the Game Boy.So, I was treated with a rather glorious presentation. The graphics are still really colorful on the Game Boy Advance, and the sound is top-notch. Oh, and there's a huge variety of characters, including the off-beat versions of some of them from MK3. Oh GOD does it fall from there.Since I was new to this particular game, I tried the \"Warrior\" (aka Normal) difficulty. MY BUTT WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY SCORPION THE SECOND I CAME IN. Not once did I even inflict damage on him, and I was trying the hardest as possible to even give the tiniest bit of damage!Apparently, I knew I couldn't handle that difficulty. The next logical thing to do was try the \"Novice\" difficulty. After all, that is the easiest difficulty setting available at all, right?Okay...I'm not making this up: It. Didn't. Change. A. Freaking. THING. This game is impossible! It's at the same standards of horrendous as Dragon's Lair on the NES!! Do NOT play this! It's a total waste of money. Avoid it and play something better! Like...MK: Deadly Alliance on the GBA. Same system, totally better game.\n",
      "I thought this would be a great game. To be honest, what would you expect? The graphics look like the SNES Ultimate MK3. Well i've played the crap out of this game and I hate it. Feel free to disagree if you're good at it, but I'm a 15-year MK vet and I know exactly what I'm talking about.The graphics and sound are great. But the music loops mindlessly over and over again, probably to accomodate all the voice files on the game. That can be forgiven. I started my first match, picking Scorpion, and they throw you in a fight against Scorpion. I got my butt handed to me in seconds. So after gaming over at least twice, I went into options menu and put the difficulty on VERY EASY, assuming I would have a chance.I didn't.The game's CPU ambushes you and once you're backed into a corner, you're as good as dead. Sure I was able to use Scorpion's spear from far away about three times, but the contact boxes suck and most projectiles don't connect even when you see that they would. Someone talked about adjusting the handicap, but it only speeds up the ass-kicking, rendering you a sitting duck... or as us MK fans call them, \"noobs\".Bottom line, if you're a collector and you want every single MK game, buy it. But if you're a gamer or an MK fan, or you want to try it out, let me save you from wasting your money: Download a ROM and waste space on your PC if you want to try it so badly, but don't spend one red cent on this waste of plastic. I love Mortal Kombat, but I HATE Mortal Kombat Advance.\n",
      "I am a very big MK fan.I've been dedicated to the series since it was first released on the home consoles back in Sept of 1993.That being said.I heard from alot of people how bad this game was,but as a TRUE fan of MK,I thought they didin't know what they were talking about and It really couldn't be all THAT bad.I was sooooo wrong!! This game is a total disgrace to the Mortal Kombat name.It's basically just Ultimate MK3,but IT IS HORRIBLE! You only got two buttons to work with,along with the d-pad of course,but it is SOOOO HARD!..and as I said,I'm an MK vet.I could not even get past the first fight.All Scorpion did was just block.Every punch or kick I tried to hit him with,he would just block.Another thing.It is almost impossible to pull off a special move.The cpu just kicks your ass,before you even have a chance to attack.Bottom line.This game sucks.You're better off just picking up MKII for the original Gameboy instead.Stay away from this worthless piece of little plastic!!!\n",
      "If you truly and utterly hate someone, then I have a little hint for you.  Buy them this game.  When they play and see the sketchy graphics, the poor backgrounds, and the fact that some of the special moves go through your opponent, they will think the game is defective.  When they go to the game store to exchange it for a real copy, you will laugh with glee as they find that there was no defect, but it was the real game!  Only use this against a bitter enemy however, as this game is an incredible torture that I would wish upon noone.  If that doesn't convince you to run away at the sight of this game, then let me put it this way: Hitler is being forced to play it right now on the 9th level of Hell.\n",
      "I'm not a master at fighting games, but I got to wiggle my way through the medium difficulty level of MK1 on SNES, and I finish the medium level of Super Street Fighter II revival. But MK advance is way too hard, even on the easiest level. It's not challenging, it's downright frustrating.\n",
      "If you are reading this, chances are you are a fan of RPGs and are already deciding on buying this. That's fine. My review won't change your opinion. If however, you are one of the newer ones who want to venture into this world, it might not be your cup of tea.Despite the rave reviews it has gotten, the word I can sum the game up is: repetitive. The core design of the game is essentially moving through areas, slashing at monsters, collecting items and leveling up. That is essentially what you'll be doing for hours, weeks, months and perhaps years.The graphics are not up to the standards of other games. However, I believe they had to do this in order to allow 4-player splitscreen mode. The music is very interesting, ranging from moody techno music to sorrowful tones.You are given the choice to choose 1 of 12 classes and change the looks of the character you are given. The classes are broken down into 3 archetypes: hunters, rangers and force. Hunters are melee fighters that fight head-on with enemies. Rangers use ranged weapons obviously and force is like the spell-casting class of the game. Within each class, you'll have some divisions such as a guy who's beefier in damage and accuracy, yet lacks the ability to cast any spell at all.Once you make a character, you are given some sort of ID that determines item drops in the game for you. You then arrive in the lobby area. Here is where you'll spend your time in the game. There is a shop to trade, sell and buy items, a medical station to heal wounds, a mission area to get more assignments and an elevator to allow you to talk to the space government. The story is loosely about a colony of humans that are inside a ship that want to colonize a planet. However, they send hunters to check if the location is safe before landing.There are two chapters to the game, hence the title, Episodes I and II. For multiplayer, you are given a splitscreen mode for up to four players. You used to be able to play online through Sega, if you purchased a Hunter's License, which is a fee of $15 each month. It's been discontinued, but there are private servers floating around that you can join.To conclude, PSO is a game that's been done before here and there. Slashing at monsters to loot them is not revolutionary, nor does it require player skill. You are going to play this game for many hours, but I don't think all those hours will be enjoyable. The true value of this game is in the online play, but even that is marginalized when you think about all the other games that let you do that and more (Diablo 2).If spending all your time grinding at simple-AI programmed monsters to collect items is your idea of fun, this game will be your fantasy. Otherwise, if you are like me, you'll feel unchallenged.\n",
      "Ladies and gentlemen, I have some terrible news. Morrowind, the third chapter in the Elder Scrolls saga, has proven to be one of the biggest PC let-downs in history. The game is a definitive example of what happens when endless opportunities meet horrible gameplay. By endless opportunities I mean that our good friends at Bethesda Softworks spent countless hours developing an amazingly beautiful and immersive 3d world...one in which you can go anywhere and do almost anything.-Open ended, epic world and events. - Though I did also say horrible gameplay...and Morrowind suffers immeasurably from just that. The fighting system is agonizingly weak. Unless you have a great weapon and awesome abilities with that weapon, you're going to spend a great deal of time getting [beat] by some of the games lowliest creatures.  Also - There are so many spells and enchantments to use that it gets overwhelming trying to remember what does what and how to use it. Not only are the spells too many, but the interface with which to use them is cumbersome and annoying as well. You get stuck in these skirmishes, and you're struggling to attack and switch spells at the same time while your enemy(impossible to outrun) beats you down with little effort. _ Like I said, the world is very beautiful and the characters are amazingly detailed, but all this is lost as the game tries to run before it can walk.  I'm sure geeks with nothing to do with their lives will have a fun time modding this one to death and spending every hour playing it until their character can stand up to the game's foes.  But for the rest of us, crap on that. - - In short, Morrowind's designers tried to stuff 5 pounds worth of greatness into an 11 ounce box.** Too much at once for any gamer who doesn't think an aggravation induced stroke should be part of epic fantasy gameplaying. - Buy at your own risk.\n",
      "The requirements on the box state soemthing to the effect of &quot;If your video card is as fast as x you may play&quot;.Well, I have a voodoo 5500 and it is definitely faster than the card they listed, but it is totally unsupported.They could at least list out the exact cards it supports, for God's sake.  SInce there are only 3 of them I think, that is not a lot to ask....Being a programmer myself I am forgiving of bugs as long as they make an effort to patch in the future, or I would not have purchased the game considering how shoddy their past games were when initially released, but this is a different story; to require the directX features that they do, they would have had to develop to that directX level before it was even released or supported by the graphics card vendors.At any real software shop, such a thing would never be considered; the 'engineers' at bethesda are proving themselves hacks more than ever with this nonsense.I for one will never be purchasing a game from this company again....\n",
      "I will echo the words of so many others who have made the mistake of purchasing this \"game.\"  My system exceeds the \"recommended requirements\" printed on the box, and yet the game, when it runs, runs horrificly.for example:1:  every time you enter a new region in the game, gameplay stops for solid minutes while the new region loads.2:  Every time I approach an NPC to interact, the game locks up for at least 60 seconds, while it loads whatever snippet of info the NPC has associated with it.3:  The game will sporadically lock up for 2-3 minutes, for no apparent reason.4:  Loading a game takes around 5 minutes.5:  support is horrible.  Beyond the standard, weak advice to \"load the most recent graphic card drivers and re-install direct X 8.1\", there is zero- I repeat- ZERO customer support available.6:  the ingame graphic engine causes my geforce 2 to lock up, even when the game is played at 640X480.Geez- I could go on- but I think the above 6 examples (which- trust me- are the very tip of the iceberg of faults that this game comprises) are reason enough to avoid this.  Playing this game is neither fun, enjoyable, or even tolerable.Furthermore- after un-installing this game, my copy of CREATURE ISLE no longer plays properly.  It's rare that a game comes along that actually does DAMAGE to your system...\n",

What's bad about this game??  The question should be, \"What's good about it?\"....nothing, and I mean nothing.  The DVD disc could be used as a coaster for drinks I suppose...but that's the only good thing I can think of.  I would have chosen \"no stars\" for this piece of flaming poo....but I'm forced to choose 1 star.  Oh well, nobody's perfect I guess.Above all, I feel pity for those that were forced to work on such an abomination.\n",
      "Every single thing about this game sucks! Without knowing what I was in for,I bought this at a local video store about five years ago for like eight bucks,and oh my god,I hated myself for planting down eight dollars for this complete waste.It's not even worth eight cents! I threw the game in the trash,because unfortunatly the damn video store would not refund my money,so I just tossed it right out.The game is terrible.The gameplay is god awful,the music and sounds suck and the characters are just a total joke. Hands down.Worst fighting game of all time.Even Shaq Fu isn't this bad.At least Shaq Fu has a \"so bad,it's good thing\" going for it. Kabuki Warriors is just bad period.Avoid this AT ALL COSTS!!!\n",
      "I purchased this with high hopes, however I should have learned my lesson from interacts awful psone monitors! this is not a high resolution screen, it is blurry and the sound quality is poor! some games move too fast for the screen and the image lags or has a trailer. on high level graphic games like resident evil the screen does not even translate some things, like mist or smoke. you must sit at a pricise angle to see most of what is one the screen and it's really dark. the sound quality is poor, there is a constant buzz coming from the spaekers, it is so loud that it drowns out most sound from the game. DO NOT BUY!!\n",
      "SILENT HILL WAS WITHOUT  QUESTION THE MOST BORING AND NON ACTION OR STORYLINE OF A GAME IVE  EVER PLAYED.FIRST OF ALL ITS ALMOST IMPOSIBLE TO GET ANYWHERE IN THE GAME WITHOUT CHEATING WITH THE BOOK I DONT BUY GAMES SO I HAVE TO CHEAT AND PLAY WITH THE BOOK SO I CAN PLAY THE STUPID GAME FINDING STUFF ON YOUR OWN IS ALL THE FUN NOT WITH SILNT HILL AND I PLAYED IT ON PS2 AND I  HATED ON THAT GAME SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT ON XBOX.WELL IM SORRY TO SAY THAT IT RANKS DOWN AS LOW AS BRITNEYS DANCE BEAT.THEY NEED TO STOP THIS MESS NOW MAKING A THIRD GAME IS GONNA DO ONLY ONE THING MAKE ME WRITE ANOTHER BAD REVIEW WHITCH I HAVE NOT DONE IN ALONG TIME SORRY ITS JUST PLAIN BAD.\n",
      "Aaarrrrggghhhh! This game is awful! I must admit that I was taken in by the storyline and creepy aura of this game. But, the game contol is the worst of any X-box game I've played. More than half of your game-time is spent just trying to make your character \"James\" go in the proper direction. There is only one thumbstick used to control both the direction he looks and the direction he moves. VERY AWKWARD!! On many occasion, such as narrow hallways etc., you find yourself pushing up on the thumbstick so that you can have a face-to-face veiw of James walking right toward you. I guess this might be OK if James was a buxom hot chick, but he's not, and this camera angle makes it impossible to see where you are going. James doesn't jump, James doesn't crouch, heck you can barely just make him walk! Konami needs to learn that no matter how good the storyline and graphics, if you can't control the character the game is worthless.p.s. Konami, can I get my $$ back?\n",
      "I don't know where some of these reviews came from, maybe they own stock in the company, but this game has extremely poor game play control and is a waste of money.  Not even close to a Max Payne.  Save your money and if you want to know anything more about the game, rent it first, even at that, save your money and buy something decent.\n",
      "When i purchased this game i thought it would be fun to play a classic game such as Baldur's Gate, but when i got to play it, omg, it is so, so slow and the graphics are incredibly horrible. I couldn't beleive what I was seeing. It's horrible. The battles are the most awful thing, the characters are the ugliest thing, the gameplay just makes you want to hit your head with the CDs and the box of Baldur's Gate and throw up on it. IT'S THE WORST RPG I HAVE EVER PLAYED. It's a disgrace to the RPGs.I like the board game, but this, this is simply a bad, bad PC D&amp;D game. Amazingly boring. Absolutely awfulDO NOT BUY. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY. I'm almost sure that you'll regret it.\n",
      "It's been said that \"if it ain't broke,don't fix it.\"So why then does Square soft keep \"fixing\" the classic elements of the FF series that so many veteran players have grown to love??Square tired to change things drastically in FF8,and it failed HORRIBLY!After playing FF9(which I rented BEFORE going straight out and buying it)I believed Square learned it's lesson with messing with a good thing,and that some times \"old school\" is truely the best option.FF10 completely destroyed my hope by changing everything....mostly for the worst!The mini-games are WAY too deep and confusing,the experience gaining system was completely ruined with a \"new\" way,and both the characters and plot were very plastic and unconvincing!Why did they make the lead hero a cocky,arrogant sports player??I actually hated the hero in the story!He kept making these \"witty\" remarks which were,well....anything but!This also brings me to the VERY BAD voice acting!It reminded me of a Pokemon or Dragonball Z episode....yech!!The only impressive thing about FF10 is the graphics,but I'm not throwing down [money] for mere eye candy!Besides didn't Square try to make a FF movie relying soley on graphics??Look what happened to it!I'll stick with good ol' fashioned 4,5,6 and 7.Think I'll go ahead and pass with the whole online only 11th installment of this series as well!\n",
      "I am not the best video game reviewer.  I dont have hundreds of games, in fact I am very limited.  I have played FF7 and 8, I loved seven the most, eight was fine but too depressing IMO.  I had seen so many good reviews and heard so many good things about X and seeing that they did a part 2 to X, well I had to buy it (needless to say I got the Playstation 2 this Christmas so like I said, not the biggest video gamer).I wanted to like X I really did.  It had some breathtaking scenes and CGs.  Some of the action was inviting.  The characters themselves were very interesting.  But.  There was one anime movie after the next, very little if any character choices to go here there and everywhere.  The storyline was so convoluted that I could not make heads or tails of what was going on, not to mention I could not understand what this Sin being was (looked like a mutant whale to me)  It was so linear and it was so tight that I got bored easily, very easily.  I felt that there were waaayyy too many tutorials. I could not and cannot understand the character evolution dynamics.  I dont understand the whole structure even with help from the walkthrough books and what I looked up on the net, maybe its just me, but this game did not fit me at all.I seriously doubt I will get X-2 now.  Oh well.  Live and learn!\n",
      "I have been waiting for Final Fantasy X to come out for a long time, and when it came out, I was obviously dissapointed.  On the adverts or as you people call &quot;commercials&quot;, it looked like a lot of fun, but it's not very fun if you don't get to do anything.  Most of it is just talking and it is even worse than Nintendo 64's &quot;Legend of Zelda - Ocorania of Time&quot;, which was a good game, but about four hours of it is just talking.  On this, it'sm more like seven hours.  Take my advice.  Don't buy it.\n",
      "I realize that a lot of people love this game but frankly it is just not my cup of tea.  Most of the time you do nothing but watch a movie.  It has to be the longest movie ever.  Even when you do get to play all you do is walk from point A to B. It is just plain boring and really slow.  I admit it could get better at the end.  I haven't invested the 300 hours that my brother has, but there are a lot better games out there where you get to play right from the beginning instead of a hundred hours into it.\n",
      "I really, really liked the game.  I could think of a ton of positive things to say, the story was good, gameplay was decent.  All the positive things other people have been saying.Then...I spend over two hours fighting some impossible-to-kill monster. (I had to fight him 4 times before I won...maybe I'm just lousy at the game, who knows?  But seriously, I'd been doing just fine up to this point.)  The game proceeded to the next scene without any opportunity to save.  And of course, I'm instantly killed in the next battle, without even a chance to fight.  (Two of the monsters literally kicked two of my characters out of the screen with special attacks, and the third proceeded to flambe the remaining character--apparently I was \"ambushed\".)  I didn't even know there was *going* to be a battle. Just brilliant, guys.Try it again?  No thanks.  I ended up trashing the DVD and throwing it away.  Any game that wants to waste my time like that...forget it. I'm sure the designers thought they were being cute.  They weren't.  No more Squaresoft games for me.Actually, make that \"no more games that don't let you save at any arbitrary time\".  I'm totally fed up with RPGs that force you to play for hours because you can't save, and this is definitely one of them.That, and the weird `random encounter' technique that Squaresoft uses really gets old.  I'd much prefer to be able to explore an area without running into yet another random battle with the same three creatures.\n",
      "As the greatest Final Fantasy fan ever, I was very much looking forward to a true sequel to Final Fantasy 7, and I've always fantasized to myself about a FF game that was on a new generation platform.  I thought FFX was going to be the game I was always waiting for, but sadly, I was mistaken.First of all, they totally mucked up the graphics.  Why did they have to move away from the elegance and beauty of the FF7 graphics?  FFX is all smooth and shiny and stuff.  Its totally just a cop-out made to look exactly like every other new RPG, rather than steering its own evolutionary course like FF7.  Who thought this game would be better by adding more polygons?  That is ridiculous.Also, the story in FFX is more boring than church. They keep bashing you over the head with it again and again.  I get it already.  If you hate your father, and become a successful Fun-ball player, then you will create a giant sin ball that will destroy the fake fantasy world you just got transported to.  Gotcha.Whose bright idea was it to put voice acting in this game?  Seriously, I can read.  Those dumb-heads at Square have severely underestimated me by doing this.  I read the FF7 script like five hundred times.  Do you really think I want to listen to this long, boring story?  No way.  Also, their voices aren't right, and I hate them.  Which reminds me, Tidus is stupid, and all whiny and wussy and stuff.  He was like my worst character, nothing like the cold, calculating majesty of Cloud.  Boo Tidus!Also, the FFX mini-games aren't nearly up to par.  Fun-ball and chocobo race just aren't any fun at all.  Not like the brilliance of FF7's sub hunt, or board race, or mog's hidden fantasy castle adventure.  Please.  I'm going to spend hundreds of hours playing mini-games, so they should be good enough to be their very own game, like all of FF7's games.  All the bonus stuff you can do in FFX was stupid and easy too.  I killed the Ultimate weapon without even breaking the slightest of sweats, unlike the titanic struggle it was in FF7.And what's the deal with the combat system?  Its like they thought I was too stupid to do things with a little action bar, and now I need it to be turn based.  And the summon animations only take like 30 seconds, so that you don't get the full majesty and wonderment of the spell.  Sitting through all five minutes of Knights of the Round was a pleasure every time, and it gave me an unnerving sense of power.  And I never needed to change out any member of my Cloud, Tifa, Cait Sith dream team in the middle of a FF7 fight, so why did they make FFX so stupid and hard and different and stuff so that sometimes I might want to switch people out.  Sometimes I just don't understand those screw ups at Square at all.Why can't they just let you level up in a normal way?  That was very confusing.  When you fight things, you get little balls or something, and you put them in a thing.  I didn't really get it.  You're supposed to just get experience points, and then every once in a while it says, \"Godly Cloud has leveled up\", and it plays the little song.In closing, this game was pretty stupid, despite my expectations.  I mean, as the greatest FF fan ever, I think I can tell these things, but this was just a hideous rehash of FF7, with nothing new added, and no innovation, and some huge backward steps in the story and character departments.  You're probably better off just playing Final Fantasy 7: \"The Sephiroth Wars\", again, because it is awesome.\n",
      "Same music, same battle engine, same lame charactor dialogue as Gandia II.Even so it would have been a fun game if I could of skiped the crapy dialogue that was made for 5 year olds.Would have been an excellent game if they would have hired some writers and voice tallent. But what they ended up with was a few hours of actualy fun game play mixed in with hour upon endless hour of crapy dialogue a five year old would find boring.Pros: Great graphicsGreat gameplay (when there was any)cons: unending crapy dialogue (made this game a no purchase for me)\n",
      "Game didn't work, well..it worked for about 15 mins then it freezes up at one particular part and no amount of disc cleaning fixes this.\n",
      "I bought this game at the full price, and discovered that all the hype was flat wrong.  The cut scenes were amazing, and the character leveling it very interesting, but that is all.  The game is very linear.  There is NO decision making on the part of the gamer about where to go or what to do.  The battle scenes are contrived and turn based, which I've always found boring and irritating.  It takes no skill or imagination to manuver through this game.  I wish I'd never bought this game.\n",
      "And that's about it, folks. The end of Final Fantasy as we know it. Why does every recent Final Fantasy have to be turn-based, has to be a long haired blonde whiner, fake voice-acting, no real strategy in battle, hard bosses, and a bland story? Because Square can't make Final Fantasies anymore, folks. Whatever happened to the goodness of 6, 7, and 9?\n",
      "This, for me, was the biggest waste of money. It is an animated story that has very mild interaction. For me, it is not a game. If you want to watch a cartoon for most of the time and then play for a couple of minutes and then watch a cartoon for a while and then play for a couple of minutes, etc., etc., then you will love this game, otherwise save your money. If you really are curious, rent it first. This way you don't waste forty+ dollars like I did. The animation is good, but I'm not going to review this for game play, because I do not consider it a game. Some love this game, and some hate it.....This is a rent first, buy later (if you like it).\n",
      "This game is a terrible game!  I hated it in every way!  The game involved little play, most of it was movies.  It was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system.  The grapics were good but only is some scenes.  In the rest, the grapics were grainy.  The bosses past the half point of the game were super impossibly hard to beat.  Before the half point the bosses were super incedibly easy to beat.  The storyline was non progressive.(it stayed the same through the whole game)  There was a pokemon style of travel.  You walk a bit, fight a bit, and thats about it.  The cut scenes were SOOOOOOO LONG, and they wernt always with good grapics.  Personally, the only thing that I would recommend this game for is to throw it in the trash.\n",
      "I understand that many people love this game. I understand that people love the characters, the storyline, and the visually stunning cutscenes. There are even people who like the levelling up system, find the combat fascinating, and feel that the emotional development of the characters is well done and genuinely touching.I am not one of them.There are a lot of things wrong with Final Fantasy X. One of the first, and most noticable changes from previous Final Fantasies is the completely voiced dialogue. This lends itself to a more natural and immersive feel when done right, but FFX's dialogue is so poorly delivered, it is more cringe inducing than inspiring.As though the scriptwriters felt they had to come up with dialogue to match the lackluster acting, the storyline is one of the most blatantly obvious and hamfisted statements I've ever seen in any medium, poorly written children's books included. The main enemy is &quot;Sin.&quot; Please.In regards to the game itself, the gameplay consists almost entirely of walking towards a red dot. I understand that that statement may seem confusing, but on the &quot;map&quot; on screen, there is a red dot pointing to exactly where you need to go to progress in the story. Looking for secret items? Head exactly in the opposite direction from the red dot, and you're more than likely to find some helpful items. This is not &quot;gameplay.&quot; This is merely the illusion of interaction in between movies. Movies that will make you want to tear your ears off, the dialogue is so horrific.The combat system is rote RPG fare, with subtle alterations to the norm that don't end up making it a better or worse experience. Grandia II's combat system stomps all over it, and honestly, after Grandia II, no company, big or small, should be making &quot;turn-based&quot; RPG combat systems that are as dull as this one.The new level up and skill development system supposedly allows for character customization, but there's simply no point. Each character starts out on the grid in a position that has an optimal path, and the *only* benefit to diverging from that path is for the novelty of having your brawler actually be a weak spellcaster, and have no brawling abilities. Whee!I played about 25 hours of FFX, before finally realizing that not only would I never bother to finish this game, I found that I hated it. Hated it with a passion. The insipid storyline, the pathetically stupid main character, the horribly written relationship between the two leads, and the god-awful, ham-fisted, ridiculous writing makes this a game that I simply cannot recommend to anyone. The fact that it's as popular as it is is a strong statement about how much influence marketing and pretty graphics have on the game buying population as a whole, and it's not a statement that I could repeat here without it getting edited.I love videogames. I love RPG's. I love a quality story. I do not, however, have any love for Final Fantasy X.\n",
      "In his room, the adolescent jumped off his favorite gaming chair and screamed profanity. Purposely he spat all over the TV and hurled the PS2 controller on the floor. The following crash sounded as if it were actual bone snapping. Done with his barrage of wet missiles on the helpless TV, the youngster brushed the saliva off his lips and frantically paced around.\"Am I dreaming?\" he asked, prancing like a demented loon, arms swinging about.Accidentally slapping his face, he simultaneously answered, \"no, I'm afraid not!\"Returning on his chair, the TV screen displayed his progression through the \"epic RPG.\" Twelve hours. It had taken him twelve hours from the latest RPG from Square for him to cease convincing himself that this RPG was even a worthy stab. Nope not this one, not by a long-shot! The inspiring Final Fantasy legacy is now fully disfigured and distorted. Formerly forgiving Square for the travesty what is Final Fantasy VIII, the kid's faith in the series momentarily went frozen and shattered. Final Fantasy X is a devastation, but to others a masterpiece, and to him utter wreckage.\"And the next one a multiplayer one? \" he was disgusted.Feeling lassitude creep on him, his distress silences him. When he says Final Fantasy X is a disappointment of lifetime, it is as authentic as the air you breathe in and puff out. Enveloped by rage, he asked himself why was he in such revulsion? Indeed, his heart was racing, his temples burning, but all because of some electronic hobby? Yes, he felt as if he Square pulled a trigger, ejecting a swarm of upset upon him. His hard-earned cash replaced by a game he surmised to accomplish title of \"Greatest RPG Ever Crafted.\" His fifty-four bucks were a definite waste, he might as well have thrown the money down from his roof and cheer for his gluttonous neighbors. Either way its fate was the same.Was the Final Fantasy series gradually reducing itself into the equilibrium of RPG damnation? Truly in a state of disgrace, the franchise has lost its traditional substance in exchange for graphical grandeur. Even though he treasured 1997's FFVII, he now speculates if it is still consummate. He decided it will remain as a fond memory, but ultimately be known as the indisputable harbinger of Square's greater goal, TO BECOME A PART OF HOLLYWOOD!Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within flopped like a bad dream. What then, Square, he thought. Recycle your cinematic visions into your latest installment of Final Fantasy? Final Fantasy X, a hybrid of little RPG significance with movie-format majority, ruins the experience to stimulate imagination of the player -- THE READER -- by deleting scripts of written dialogue and basing an epic with snappish and terse voices. He wished for broad, intriguing reads, and by the Gods, he wasn't a slothful boy. What driven him on the edge of vehemence were the maddening voice-overs. A gamer who valued his imagination, he utilized his creative mind to mentally produce the voices of past Final Fantasy casts. Final Fantasy X puts the enjoyment to total extinction. Despite the impressive apparatus of the well functioning Grid Sphere and the edge-cutting battle system of letting all characters partake in the forceful battles, the assets dig their own grave by the objectionable shortcomings.99% of his worship for RPGs derived from plot and characters. Oh, how he waited to be immersed into Square's next chapter, he struggled, but the more he threw himself into the venture, the more he apprehended that the characters were second-hand versions of previous installments. His observation of Auron summoned Vincent (FFVII) and Shadow (FFVI) in mind; Luna, an almost exact replica of Rinoa (FFVIII); Tidus was an older version of Zidane (FFIX); Kimahri and Rikku were the easiest to fathom, Kimahri is an identical version of Mareg from Grandia II and Rikku is Yuffie (FFVII). The thought of the beloved characters being disguised by a barrage of graphical distinction only proliferated his antipathy. Worse, the arch-villain Seymour, he thought, was a joke, and there is nothing funny about it. He saw Seymour as an inept villain, who solely upheld the attributes of being immoral because he is undead and lost the balance of reality. Every bit of the unoriginality, killed off any reason to gobble the quest or even bring it to an end it.Unlike the spit he easily wiped off his mouth, the kid couldn't free the fact that the story's direction suffocates an excellent battle system. What could have been worthwhile proportions is trodden by the hum-drum purposes of the characters, a lethally boring arch-villain, and the idea that the [bad]characters are reincarnations of past Final Fantasies. All of it led him to the decision that indicated how low, uncreative, and money-ravenous the former console RPG messiahs sunk.Square's motive to him was grounded on the construction of \"videogames\" being incorporated with theatrical premises. In turn, it costs the fundamentals of the RPG genre. Is the company now a capitalist pig intent on deceiving players by saturating commercials and zines with a multitude of striking full motion videos? When a Final Fantasy disc comes out, it isn't the gameplay that clocks in the hours, its the superfluous videos and dreadfully voiced scenes. Anything with the name of Final Fantasy (in videogames, mind you) will have Square put their Speedos on, and dive in an ocean of cash. Where will all this cash go? Maybe to -- again -- futilely make a come back in the movie industry? To reinstate their name of the laughingstock that they are in Hollywood? You can call it paranoia, you can call it absurd, but Sixto Limiac calls it theory.\n",
      "I bought this based on most of the other reviews. I thought it would be exciting. NOT! You have to sit there and watch these boring scenes and stupid storylines. Then you get a couple seconds of control. Some of the battles are fun, but you have to wait soooo long to get to them, it's not worth it. The worst thing is if you die, you have to sit through all the storyline AGAIN to get back to your battle. No cuts or fast-forwards. I still can't believe that! IF I RENTED IT FIRST, NO WAY WOULD I HAVE BOUGHT IT!\n",
      "I have 30 hours into this movie/game, because I refused to believe Square would come out with a movie in the guise of a game. And FFX is just that. A movie with limited (and I mean LIMITED) player interaction, on a level with the horrible Xenogears. There are NO camera angle changes, and no 360 degree control. The game is TOTALLY and completely linear. You spend the first two hours watching young Tidus, a supposedly great blitzball player, whine and whimper about `his old man' disappearing when he was young. Not only is the voice over emotionally inconsistant, the pitch is irritable. AND YOU CANNOT X-MASH THROUGH THE SCENES! The `game' is in complete control thoughout. The plot is entangled (and I mean in knots) with religious conflict and political manipulation, the intricacies of which, as an adult, I understood and enjoyed. As a teen, I wouldn't tolerate it, and would be horrified when I found YOU CANNOT BYPASS A SINGLE SCENE THROUGHOUT THE GAME. While most of the backdrops are graphically superior, there is little exploration allowed. Your characters run only only on paths in area scenes, and there is NO world scene, and no control over destination. You only go where the game sends you. (I have 30 hours in, I hope it changes...)But there are some redeeming factors here. If you don't mind watching another `Final Fantasy: Spirits Within' movie, you are in luck. The computer graphics are absolutely breathtaking. As far as ganes go, FFX is the CG feather in Square's cap,  especially the ocean scenes involving Sin, the mega-whale sized creature bent on destruction. I have never seen creatures and water displayed with such realism. On land, the trees sway, and I wish Square had invested as much time in the gameplay as they did making everyone's hair move in the breeze. The voice-overs were a step up in reading text after text after text (I turned the text off and just listened...)The battle scenes are copied from FFIX with a few graphic enhancements. The `sphere' grid' is a new way of powering up and learning spells, and is the most amusing part of the game. Weapons do not get stronger (you buy/find ones with different attributes) which is diappointing. Now for the Aeons, your summoned beings. There are only 4, taken from FFIX, with some very nice enhanced graphics. Unfortunately, the summoning scenes are excrutiatingly long (at least 15 seconds each and every time. Apparently Square was so enamured with the graphics, you CANNNOT shorten them as in prior FF games. You might as well get up and make a sandwich everytime you summon), so you prefer to leave Yuna, the heroine out of the battles. The sphere grid is a neat new way of upping HP and MP, and is actually challenging to maze through.  The side game of Blitz is fair, but I found the control buttons do not respond per the instructions. You'll see. And, the game controls the matches. I prefered the card games in FF VIII and IX. And for you mothers of 12 year old boys, FFX graphics are true to EVERY scantily clad female body movement, so be ready for Lulu the Black Mage.I play nothing but RPG's and Res-Evil style games. RPG stands for Role Playing Game. There is little to be had here except for moving the characters in and out of the battle scenes. I have 30 hours into this game only because I couldn't believe Square would come out with another game/movie (guess I forgot Xenogears) As a game, this falls so far short. As an example of computer graphic capabilities, Square has given us the showcase of the year. And I do mean a showcase. This is the feather in Square's graphics cap.I have played every FF game, as well as almost every RPG made. I cannot recommend you buy this as a game, new. I would wait a week for the movies fans to return theirs, and buy it then. Since it is totally linear, without skip capabilities, I would not rent this. You will have it a while. Perhaps I will update this after I finish the `game', unless I just get sick of it and move on.There are several other Square games much more suited to GAMING. I recommend FF IX most highly, as well as ChronoCross (very nicely done), the sequel to ChronoTrigger. Also try, Legend of Dragoon, Star Ocean: Second Story, and Breath of Fire III. For Dreamcast, try Skies of Arcadia. 50 hours of total 360 degree control through an extremely vast world.\n",
      "Well I am a huge fan of Final Fantasies but this one was just an embarassment. The point is just like any other FF but i'll let ya know whats wrong with it. First of the main character...Tidus....I think the name speaks for itself. The kid is a moron. Apparently he is a professional \"blitz ball\" player whatever the hell that is. One of the poorest excuses of a sport I have ever seen. More or less underwater soccer with cheap rules and unrealistic physics. But in short the entire time I was playing the game I was embarassed just playing as Tidus. Probably the worst FF character their is in the saga of Final Fantasies.The magic and sphere grid was stupid as hell. You couldn't get your magic without waiting for a couple of years and it took forever to get around it. Remember in the other FFs when you got your magic and spells by gaining expierence or by collecting items. Well in this game Tidus and the gang thought up something new. Now you have to go through this annoying ass sphere grid which takes an hour to learn and another 100 hours to complete(Probably more).Now the concept is just like I said similar to the other FFs with a story of love involved with the saving of all human kind. Well in this story Tidus is supposed to save the world with his \"girlfriend\" Yuna. The other characters are complete tag-ons and them making an impact on the story did not come into play at all.Another thing wrong with this game was the boss. Now over the years in a bunch of different games I have seen werid bosses and cool bosses. Nevertheless it was nothing like I saw here. The boss \"Sin\" is a big blob. Not only that but hes brown (kinda makes you think). So with a queerish fellow like Tidus fighitng a Brown Blob Sin the game reached an all time low. So think about it do you want to reduce yourself to a level of absolute disgrace..If not don't play this game otherwise go for it and be embarassed out of your mind and be bored as hell. You will be disapointed. Their is an absolute gurantee that you will be disapointed after your done playing this game!!\n",
      "Don't get me wrong I love Final Fantasy but FFX is poo! First you might be expecting a 4 disc set like previous versions but this one is a one disk game.  This means less space for a variety of music (The battle song gets real old real fast) and less space for graphics (All the good graphics are the same as they show you on the commercial, nothing new) after you see all the good graphics Square really skimps on the characters details.  They turn into 16 bit graphics before your half way through the game.  Final Fantasy had a good reputation with previous versions but this one is just riding the comp wave.  The next one will have to be better because this one stinks!\n",
      "While the graphics are good among the best on PS2 the game itself is long, tedious, and boring.  Not the way video games should be made.  What Squaresoft should do is stop making Final Fantasy a video game and instead continue making movies of it that flop, or books that no one will buy.In closing, save your money for a decent game or buy this game and take destroy it in some creative way.\n",
      "im not officially reviewing this game. Rather, I'm posting this in hopes that someone who is having the same problem with this game that i am might be able to help me!I cannot get it to play for more than 5 minutes or so before it crashes and I must restart my system. I have the DVD-Rom and CD-Rom versions of this game and both act the same. The game's site has produced no resutls and I've gotten no response from the site's webmaster. My system is technically ample for this game, and i see no reason for it not to work. If anyone else has encountered this problem, let me know.Im sure this game is spectacular! I just have to get it to run!IXXrepster@san.rr.com\n",
      "This is the poorest design I have seen in 20 years of gaming. The interface is extremely confusing. You are moving in one direction until the cut scene then you are moving in the opposite direction. So until you get the hang of it, you're running back and forth between scenes. Most of the attractions will not allow you in until you accumulate enough points for either a cap or an E pass. How do you accumulate points? By picking up garbage and throwing it in trash cans! Wow this is fun! Or collecting letters that make up the name Universal Studios Theme Park. My daughter and I played for about half and hour and finally gave up. It was dull, boring, and frustrating. We had more fun making fun of the game than playing it. I can't believe they actually make you pay for this!!! STAY AWAY unless you want a lesson in how BAD a game can be.\n",
      "This game is really bad.  You go into the park and walk around picking up trash off the ground.  Then you become hopelessly lost in the park because there are no maps or signs or anything.  And when you finally find one of the rides, Woody Woodpecker says you can't go in because there are too many people.  So you have to find your way back to the entrance (good luck) and buy a cap with the points you have earned shaking characters hands and picking up trash.  The camera angles leave much to be desired and can't be adjusted at all.  Back to the Future and Wild Wild West games are moderately fun for about 5 minutes.  Anyone can beat the game in a day or two.\n",
      "When you blow you hard earned dosh on this and begin to play it, you are given the chance to pick up rubbish...Erm...Yep, you read it right, you play dustman for the day and pick up litter.Assuming you are not frantically searching for the reciept, you then get to ride on one of the amusments for a prize before going back to play litter pick up.In short... THIS GAME SUCKS!!!The graphics may look O.K, but it's this kind of game that gives Gamecube a bad name.

      "Loved MoO2, one of the greatest games ever. Maser of Orion 3 is as far from 2 as cow poop is from filet minion.I borrowed this game (along with stagy guide) from a friend right after this game came out. Installed and tried it over the weekend. Was so Gosh Darned AWFUL that I brought it back to him the following Monday. He wouldn't take it back. Is such a pile of crap of a game, that he would NOT even accept the game back.If you pay money for this, like any money, at all, you will regret it. Someone GAVE this game to me, and I regret owning it.If you're on the fence about spending money on this, take the money you are going to spend and give it to a midget to kick you in the nuts for 4 hours, you will get more enjoyment out of it than this game.\n",
      "There are many 4X/Space-Stratagey fans out there, and many attempts to make games in this genre. But sadly, few are successes. Some are good, but few know about them, such as Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain (one of my favorites). Some are good, and everyone who knows the genre exists knows the game, such as Master of Orion 2. Some are just colasal flops, and usually for many different reasons.Do I have experience enough to judge a good 4X game? Well, I have played many of the games, but some disagree with my views on them. Here are the ones I have. My all time favorite, Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain; Master of Orion 2, one of my less favorites; Space Empires 4, in the middle of my list; Conquest: Frontier Wars gets second place; Star Wars: Rebelion, had potental, but didn't quite deliver; Star Trek: Birth of the Federation, also had potential, but didn't quite deliver. And that's all I can think of right now.Anyway, on to Master of Orion 3. The prequel, MoO2 was many people's favorite, and it was good for when it came out (though I prefered Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain), but I wasn't one of it's biggest fans. Now MoO3 is a different story. I didn't actually buy it mind you. I got the full version 60 minute demo, and it was terrible. Although better visually than most, the menus and selection are very poorly done and getting anything done is nearly impossible. I didn't see the battles, but that makes no difference if the main interface is so bad you can't get anything done. There is little helpful information for running your empire.All-in-all, this game isn't worth the time of day. If you want a 4X game, I reccomend getting Conquest:Frontier Wars, MoO2, or Space Empires 4. I haven't tried Galactic Empires yet, but it looks cool, so that could be a possibility. But this isn't the game that you are looking for. So hit the back button, and move on. If you don't believe me, just read the other reviews on this game.\n",
      "This is the worst game of its type.  Save your money.Graphics are about 15 years out of date.Manual is just a story that takes places at the end of Moo2.The only thing you will ever fight is troop transports...LOL.  What a joke.  Glad my friend gave me his copy.  Oh, nice cover art on the box.\n",
      "I tried to play this game untill I got to a fun point.  I really did.  But it was for naught.  The game just plain ...1- \"real time space combat\" in this game = watching little dots on your screen shoot at eachother for awhile.  The space combat graphics look like they are from 1990.  Their is very little in way of stradegy to it at all.2- 4+ levels of menues you have to navigate through just to manage a planet.  Each planet you go requires that you click through menu after menu to get anywhere.3- The Tech tree is basicly an AI controlled monstrosity that you can't really understand or control.  Your scientists study multipule sciences at the same time and go on to the next automaticly.  The whole thing is very confusing.  There is no sence of \"I need to get this tech so I can get 'x' ability\".4- The enemy AI is [horrible].  Completely stupid.  I often found enemy races declaring war one turn, making peace the next, then declaring war again the turn after... over and over for round after round.Take this for what it's worth from someone who put a lot of initial time into the game.  I won't be playing it again.  Total rip off.\n",
      "If anything this game got me reHooked on Master of Orion 2.  This game just sits there and plays it's self and that makes it boring, very boring.  Any chance we can get a Master of Orion 4 that is based on the aspects that made this line of games fun and popular instead of something new?\n",
      "Obviously I am rather biased about this game since I like Asheron's Call better.  But I have played them both and while they both have many of the same problems inherent to a MMORPG such as lag, and cheating and e-bay selling.  But Everquest has some problems that Asheron's Call doesn't have.#1 All updates to Asheron's Call are free, all updates to EQ are not free and you need to go out and buy the latest version to get the fix, and be able to play with your friends again.#2 In comparison to the developer attention and responses to customer wants and needs, Asheron's Call's developer team seems to make a much larger effort to accomodate their customers as much as possible.  The AC developers have a message board where they answer questions and make statements, and they release build notes every month on their updates, and they have a monthly live developer chat where you can ask your questions and get them answered right away, with the transcript of the chat being posted afterwards.  EQ doesn't even come close to this, and seems to like having a wall between their devs and their customers.#3 Then there is game-play.  My number one problem with this game is like myself, many people DO NOT like to *HAVE TO* fight and play in groups. A lot of people play RPG and adventure games for the atmosphere and people, but they also like to do things on their own. In EQ, you CANNOT fight and hunt solo. If you do you are monster food.  In AC almost anyone can hunt solo and reap the rewards of solo hunting.Like I said this is a biased review, but everything I wrote here is true, think about it.\n",
      "I haven't played this game and probably never will because...WARNING:  I read this game has no season or dynasty mode.  I read this on a game related website.  I'm not 100% sure, but if this game truly doesn't have a season or dynasty mode (only tourney or exhibition) then I'm not buying it.  What is the point in this game without a season mode or recruiting and all that stuff?  EASports has really let me down.Their NCAA Football has a great recruiting system.  NBA Live has all kinds of season and career options.  Now EA sports bball on the PS2 (supposed to be a great system) doesn't even have a season.  I was going to get this game for by birthday, but now I'm definitely not.  What a joke and an insult.  I'll now look into NBA 2k2 or just wait until baseball season to buy a sports game.  Heck, I might even try hockey.\n",
      "I cannot believe that EA sports made this piece of junk as part of its otherwise superior sports series.  No season mode, no historical teams, and limited replayability..  Buy a previous years' edition instead.\n",
      "I cannot articulate how horrible this game is. See, the key word here is &quot;game.&quot; &quot;Game&quot; is missing from this. Sure the graphics and the sound are 3d, sure they are cool the first time you see them... but the &quot;relative ease&quot; that is referred to by many many reviewers who seem to be in cahoots with Sega is that it takes a total of 45 minutes to beat all the boards. There are ***5*** missions, and they make up for this lack by adding ridiculous features like &quot;score attack&quot; which *gasp* lets you get points. WHO CARES? What, I'm going to beat my old points? Very lame to get this as a bonus.The music is alright trance music, but the 40th time you try to play a board to do it a little bit better it is just annoying to hear a BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM drum beat.When you are playing it, it is very immersive. But then a whole 40 mins are past and you've completed the game and what, you're supposed to want to play it again in a different &quot;mode&quot;? Ridiculous.The first warning is the booklet. &quot;Press X to shoot&quot; is about all it says. Oh, wait, it also describes the whopping 2 power ups (one makes you stronger, one makes you ... uh... shoot a lot).If you notice the glowing reviews they say &quot;its more than a shooter, its an 'experience!'&quot; along with &quot;its really cool to look at, it's not explainable as a game!&quot;Translation: the gameplay is nonexistant, and you can show off your PS2 (sorta, i thought the graphics were LAME at times) to grandma for 4 minutes, and the shots and explosions are timed so they all coincide with the music.This makes an experience? yawn. Essentially the timed music thing is BOGUS anyway, which is why the enemies are so spread apart. If you press fire very rapidly you can hear the shots coming out in a pattern. Sometimes when you press the button you hear no shot. Oooh! Marvelous technology!Seriously, don't believe the hype - I'm sure its all about Sega's deep pockets (which is why you hear about panzer dragoon and SC5 in the same breath, even though this game mangles what was good with both of those).This was such a dissapointment. It's on a CD, not a DVD... couldn't they have made like 3 times more boards, enemies, items and stuffed it on a DVD?Unless you like to play the same 4 boards over and over again so you can &quot;master&quot; the techniques, as said on the box, the play is mindnumbing. How about make 20 levels rather than 20 bonuses?Bottomline - rent it, it's cool for a night. But warning, you'll feel ripped off if you rent it too.\n",
      "This game is so over rated or at least rated by those who only are addicted to the game and techno music.  The only reason to buy the game is if you want to listen to the same techno music all the time.  The sound effects are NOT all people crack them up to be.  The gameplay is so simple my 8 year old nephew went through this game with ease.  There is no challenge in the game and if you do like the music in this game you will be happy to know that there is a sound track coming out so you can pick that up for 10 bucks rather than wasteing your money on this less than satisfying game which is 50 bucks.\n",
      "I loved the first Sonic Adventure game (Gamecube remake) and I only expected this one to be as good, if not better. But, boy was I wrong. It's a truly horrible game that's scattered all over the place with no non-linear progression or free roaming abilities of the original.The graphics are ugly, the camera system is the worst I have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive. Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game? Or the cool mini-games that keep you coming back again and again? It was just ugly and garish and far inferior to Sonic Adventure. Do not buy or rent.I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it.\n",
      "This is not a review of incompetence, for I am not careless with my discs. Understanding what a piece of junk the PS2 is to begin with, I found a large, circular scratch that the disc tray had created, considering the scratch had encompassed the disc and had been perfectly circular, I know that I couldn't have created it. I followed all the instructions given, and I found that the results I had gotten sound similar to what is said on this page. The codec conversations didn't work before I used the Game Dr. but now the game doesn't work at all. Because I think this is a problem with the PS2 (it doesn't read my DVD movies anymore, no matter what condition), be sure not to use this product if you own a PS2, particularly if your system is over a year old, as that is where most of the problematic consoles lie.\n",
      "I purchased this game while still reveling in GTA3 and thought it would be comparable in at least action and goals, but it wasn't. The erroneous comparisons of reviewers come from the maker (Rockstar) and the violence, but that's where the similarities end. I've managed to play it two or three times after bringing it home and haven't bothered since. The game has no real direction, cartoon like graphics and unimaginative gameplay. ... Obviously, other gamers feel the same way that I do if a major chain is already selling off their excess. Stick to the other Rockstar hits and avoid this bomb. If you have even a modicum of intelligence, you'll grow bored with it quickly.\n",
      "No Plot, sense less no point violence.  If some one can tell me wha the point of making this game is I may pay you.  This game flat out [isn't good]\n",
      "What a mess! This game stinky inky inks inks and that is my honest and most friendly opinion of this game. It doesn't even dip into the grand theft auto pool. This is a uneven, unfinished, and unfun game. I WARN YOU ONCE TO STAY AWAY\n",
      "oh man...i'm in a mental state of depression, i haven't spoken to anyone in 3 days, i haven't eaten, i've lost sleep and whenever i DO get to sleep, i have nightmares about this game actually being GOOD......but it's NOT!, for the love of GOD, please don't get your hopes up on this major disappoinment, ROCKSTAR has hit the peak with GRAND THEFT AUTO 3, but got shot right back down and got buried TWICE with THIS game, 100+ missions taking at the most 1 minute 30 seconds each, WOW! WE'RE LIVIN ON THE EDGE THERE! WOOOHOOO!....(not)...but ne wayz, i'l admit it....at the beginning it's kinda fun blowing stuff up, using an assortment of weapons......THAT'S IT!....even the storyline [isn't good]! and not to mention the instability of game controls...oh my, this game is SO not for me, no way, a big NO NO for the your collection of 5 star games...i mean, i wouldn't even suggest to RENT this game, i'm sorry....but according to my own personal game fanatic opinion.....THIS GAME [STINKS]! &lt;vomit>, but that's just ME....go ahead and buy it, it's a free country :)\n",
      "state of emergency - PS2 games get worse and worse. it is only fun for the first 15 minutes or so, then you can just throw it away or burn it on the camp fire.\n",
      "I mean this game is fantastic it truly is a great game you have to try it out. State of Emergency for Playstation 2 makes one hell of a Coaster! Never again will your drinks leave marks on the furnature with this remarkable gem from Rockstar. I reccomend that anyone who is looking for a something to rest their drinks on try this game.\n",
      "No, it isn't woo at all. Boo, it's boo. The game is bad. It is repetitive. I took it back after 2 days. Bad game, easy to beat, and even easier to hate.You walk around and shoot stuff. You find stuff like guns, and shoot otehr things. There are no cool characters. There are like 4 environments that are small, repetitive, and bland. You honestly can't say anything good about this game.On the kaos mode, you can shoot everything for points. All the time you will be under civilian penalty. O THATS REAL FUN! If you shoot a civilian you lose tons of points. For about 2 seconds the penalty is off, but by that time you don't wanna break you boring streak of not killing anything and only shooting controlled burst to avoid killing any civilians.Seriously, there isn't any freedom in this game like gta. There are no extras, there is nothing to do except follow some guys, and do work for them. Don't buy it.\n",
      "Mm hmm, this game is all hype. It gets old so quick that by the time the Rockstar splash logo has faded out you're already halfway asleep. It was a good concept, ok, I'll admit that but it was done all wrong. Rockstar hit the G-spot with GTA3 and sold this in its shadow. Big mistake. This game is worse than The Crow: City of Angels in the position of a follow-up. I know, it's not a sequel, but it was banking on the same principle. Ultimately, only own this game if someone gives it to you as a gift...even then you might want to throw this cow chunk in the trash and slap the buyer in the face with a bag of staples. Think about it.\n",
      "I'm 45 years old, and have been a avid video gamer since Pong came out. Atari, Commodore, you name it! So if I say a game is really junk...I speak from experience. In fact, I would prefer most Commodore 64 games to this title! The PS2 was designed to offer much more than State of Emergency asks of it. Save your money!\n",
      "Hmmm, this is pretty strange... why is the main character and other characters....cartoon characters? i thought this was going to be a game of revolt and mayhem but instead got a disney movie turned bad.I was smart enough to rent this game because its really mind dulling after only a short amount of time, say about 5 minutes. Don't be fooled by the fact this game is made by Rockstar Games, (which made excellent classics such as Grand Theft Auto, and Max Payne) it simply is a bunch of cartoon characters running everywhere holding T.V.'s and other items that they have stolen, basically getting in the way.The missions are pointless. The game is pointless. State Of Emergency could have been another Rockstar masterpiece but unfortunately they took the cartoonish &quot;NBA Street style&quot; of graphics with oompa loompas running everywhere. At least NBA Street had ebonics. Nice try Rockstar for a new approach, but stick to the realistic action/adventure games. I'd rather play a video game without having the fear of knocking over a pokemon.\n",
      "At first, I thought this game was another Rockstar smash, but after 3 days, I beat the game there was nuthin' 2 do, n da game was wack.  I tried other modes, but they got borin' 2 fast.  This game is nowhere close to GTA3.  The game is fast, and borin'.  I ended up tradin' it to my brother for Max Payne.  Max Payne was a much bigger hit than this.  don't git this garbage, unless u r a big fan of riot games, and end up killin ever1, then rent it.  Even GTA 1 and 2 were better than this.  Sfter all the screenshots, and the good reviews, I thought this would be great, but it was a 100% rip off.  This game is probobly rockstars worst.\n",
      "I couldn't wait to get this. GTA is the greatest game - ever!I can't stand playing this for more then 15 minutes. It's mind-numbing just running around doing the same thing over and over.The characters are funny for the first 5 minutes, but that's it. I rented it, and didn't even keep it the full 5 days. Thank God I didn't buy it. I think Rockstar just threw some [stuff] together while GTA is still hot. The story line, block graphics, lack of plot, and awful gameplay all show that they put zero thought or effort into this game.I guess I'll just have to wait for GTA IV.\n",
      "We should have all known this would happen once GTA3 made it big - that Rockstar would try to follow it up with a similar themed game, without the things that made the first one great.  Enter State of Emergency, a game that allows you to kill a lot of people, occasionally for the benefit of a local thug, and that's roughly it.  Gone are the engaging risky plot elements of GTA, the high speed chases, the expansive worlds, the threatening personalities.  What remains is a shallow, hollow attempt at a game which never acheives the same high caliber of the GTA series.  In State of Emergency, you'll throw large objects at innocent bystanders' heads, bash in skulls with garbage cans, fire away into a crowded mall, or just punch strangers without care.  Sounds fun, I'll admit.  But after about twenty minutes of wanton destruction, you'll wonder, what else is there to do?  Sadly, the game implicitly answers: not much.  Zero replay value, and only short-lived initial shock-value intrigue.  Pass this one up, and wait for Vice City.\n",
      "\"State of Emergency\" really puts you in a State of emergency when you spend so much on it and it turns out to be the worse game you have ever purchased. The graphics, well theyre okay. But the gameplay has no meaning. You are running around like a lunatic with no substancial goal to achieve. Overall the game serves no meaning and its a waste of money, aswell as time. If you were expecting another GTA3, this game is no where near it!!!\n",
      "I rented this yesterday for a 3-year-old, figuring the music and graphics would be something she'd enjoy.Imagine my chagrin when the game came on and there was NO SOUND.  I poked and prodded and looked for options, but couldn't find any indication of why it didn't work.Someone online had the answer for me:  for whatever reason, the producers of this game elected not to include a digital audio out sound track.It's a music game.  Hello?My PS2 is integrated into my home theatre system--to maximize performance, it's hooked up with a component video cable and an optical digital audio cable. If your system is hooked up in a similar way, you will not hear the audio for this game without reconfiguring your PS2 hookup.On my system, a bad design choice makes this game unplayable.  Zero stars.\n",

      "I absolutely HATE this screen. It is so tiny, that you cant even see anything barely. I play sports games mainly, but on this screen its nearly impossible to play because you cant see anything. NOT WORTH 150 BUCKS AT ALL!!! There is another option out there that i will tell you about here...Go to best buy, or another electronics company, and buy a power inverter. i have a JENSEN brand 300 watt inverter. It plugs straight into your cigarette lighter spot in the car. Then, if you have a small kitchen tv that some people have, or about a 13 inch tv, you can plug that into the inverter, and have a full sized tv in the back of your car or whereever you want. Defintittely the better option, worth the money...i think the inverter is the same cost as the piece of crap screen.\n",
      "Came broken on arrival. This is designed to hook on the back of the fat PS2, but when I hooked it up, only the audio played. It's also heavy.\n",
      "Haha 150 bucks are you kidding me. What a waste. This is ridiculous. Yes I am too poor to buy a tv so im going to buy a small LCD screen for 150 dollars, pathetic. You can plainly tell from the product and the character on the screen of the product this is a shi*ty a*s item. Instead buy a small tv. Or buy Final Fantasy X that doesn't require a tv. Just requires a small brain.\n",
      "TERRIBLE! I played a few levels and it is absolutely terrible! I think the only good James Bond game i ever played was goldeneye but even that got old but this gets old from the first gun shot. terrible controls. I won't buy this game unless it's...on sale forget about this!\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that I bought the PS2 only because I was waiting to buy this game (thankfully NHL 2002, GTA 3, KO Kings 2001 & Victorious Boxers have made the purchase well worthwhile anyway)and have just ran out and bought it on it's first day of release.My first inkling of something possibly being wrong occurred when I read the directions and saw that the career mode if you can call it that, no longer has training, and is limited to a pyramid shaped grid in which you have to defeat 4 boxers on the lower level, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next and wallah you fight for the title. There is no longer a list of 20 contenders with records who you must train and fight, and no real sense of a true career.My next inking of something amiss was when i saw the controls and found out there is no actual button for an uppercut.  instead of having an uppercut button, you have a right hook button, which any boxing person knows does not exist for a right handed boxer in real boxing.  The uppercut is thrown by holding the R1 button and pressing another button....did I mention there's no options to configure the controls to make them more intuitive? So you have a straight right button and a right hook button that pretty much do the same thing...real realistic 'aint it?Anyway, I was still looking forward to playing the game and just popped it in.  The first thing I noticed was that the graphics are MUCH more primative then last year (a great game by the way) and the fighters all looked emaciated and stooped like they had a bad back.  The punch animations were stiff and actually reminded me of the crummy first version of KO Kings...now for the really awful part..as if this failure of a game really needs more.....BODY PUNCHES...they do not exist!!!!!  Actually they do exist but you have no control over them!  You throw a right to the head and if the computer deems it better to go to the body then it simply becomes a body blow.  There is no button to actually choose a body blow, just the computer deciding for you.  Needless to say this gives the game a feeling of complete lack of control...what's more, you cannot even choose to block body punches...there is only a block button and if you opponent throws a punch the computer decides should go to the body, then you block it by pressing the same button you would to block a head shot.  Even more ridiculous, the L2 button (which in previous versions allowed you to go to the body) now is the low punch button.  So by hitting it you can always throw a low blow..the only problem being that you get disqualified after around 5 of them and just by accident your going to throw a few since instincively you hit L2 thinking you will be throwing a body blow...why Black Ops decided to give such an important button over to something that has so little use should just stand as an example of the ineptness of the bozos who designed this game. Pretty much this is a button mashing mess with no redeeming qualities that becomes repetitive after a few minutes...yes not much of a lasting value, unless you're on your deathbed, which is probably preferrable to playing yhis game.From my review, I guess you can tell I was severely dissapointed with this game.  I so wanted to like it, and based on last year's game, am in utter shock as to how this could have happened.  I appreciate that they wanted to incorporate a new engine like Victorious Boxers, but that game based its system on realism, where you have to learn to counter, go to the body, and just plain box!  This game is simply a watered down version of Teken, with subpar graphics and no kicking.  I am returning mine tommorow (at a 15% penalty) so I never have to polute my PS2 with this garbage.  I implore anyone looking for a boxing simulation to stay away from this, or the designers will not get the message that they cannot peddle [garbage].  Even if you are not looking for a boxing simulation, and are interested in a fighting game, you can do way better then this.  Shame on Black Ops and EA Sports for releasing this disgrace.\n",
      "I bought this game a few days ago because my pirated copy of knockout kings 2001 was malfunctioning. I liked KK2001 a lot and didn't think twice about buying the 2002 version. To my surprise the game went backwards, the graphics are not better, the punches have no reality in them, the control layout is terrible.EA ... me on this one! I'll stick to pirated copies of EA'sgames in the future.\n",
      "Then was a time when you could look nowhere else for the best sports games. It did not matter how many sports games were made, if it wasn't made by Ea Sports then it was not worth playing. That era is sadly gone. It has passed the same way that many of the old stadiums have. We now reflect on the games of old because the last thing one wants to do is look at what Ea is producing now.Their games are worse than Michael Jordans attempts to hit a curve. Triple play 2002 has shown again that the creativity, imagination and dedication to the sport they are trying to emulate has faded.The graphics of this game are just plain bad. It is slow, The players are out of proportion and the overall effect just isn't there. The gameplay is bad and players are unresponsive to commands. Batting is done via that new idea in baseball game. The stupid target/crosshairs box. Someone should just realise that idea is just plain dull.Realism is not really there much either. At the end of the day it just is not that much fun. A game I did enjoy was high heat. Not a great leader in any area. But the gameplay was strong enough to have fun with. And having fun is what I want from a game. But until we see a baseball game to the standard of NFL2K2 by Segasports then I suggest we save our money and wait till we get something good.\n",
      "MLB Triple Play 2002 was quite a disappointment from my standpoint. Basically, the graphics are very poor and the player's faces don't look anything like players. For example, Luis Gonzalez (the player one the cover) is missing his facial hair. It's not that different than Triple Play 2001, only updated rosters and added stadiums for teams who changed. When I compared the two games, the stadiums in Triple Play 2001 looked a lot better than the ones in the 2002 version.Triple Play 2002 also skimped on the pitches for individual players. They gave a fastball and a change-up to every pitcher (whether they really throw it or not) and added some other pitches that did not match pitching styles i.e. giving a curve ball to Armando Benitez instead of a splitter, etc.Another weak aspect of this game is the lack of game modes. They have all the same things as Triple Play 2001, exhibition, season, playoffs, and homerun derby. Yawn.I suggest you don't buy this baseball game. I perfer Major League Baseball High Heat 2002. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is so well developed that sometimes I think I'm in the stands watching the game! Also, the player's faces match the ones in real life (which is nice to know considering Triple Play 2002 didn't get anything right.) Buy Major League Baseball High Heat 2002, it's a 50 dollar payment very well spent. Check out this game at Amazon reviews to find out more about it. I guarntee, you will not regret getting this game over Triple Play 2002!\n",
      "i feel that dance dance revolution is better and this game only copied it. If you where interested in this game. Get Dance Dance Revolution or one of the sequals such as ddr max.I also recommend the mats for it.the mats last about a year.Pros of Dance Dance Revolution:Good exercise with matsHelps you make quick desicisions with fast songsHelps timingFunCons of Dance Dance Revolution:very very addictive but who caresmats only last a year long [yes that addictive]\n",

      "Don't get me wrong-- I LOOOVE the Sims-- I have all four.  I didn't give this game a rating because I haven't played it yet.  However, with Sims Hot Date, there are too many bugs, and even though Maxis did a recent patch for such problems as Sims not being able to get off a couch after cuddling, some purchase items not being transferred, etc., (I tried downloading the most recent patch for HD, and can't due to problems with their winzip)I hope that most bugs are worked out for this program prior to release date.  I think that Maxis is coming out with these additions much too fast and are not really testing enough prior to releasing-- hence, the many problems with the Hot Date program.  I will just wait about 8 months to a year before purchasing Vacation-- Maybe they'll have all the bugs worked out by then.\n",
      "Buyer beware -- If you're buying this because it's the cheapest dance mat available, you're going to get exactly what you paid for.  I am just getting into DDR so I bought this to practice at home.  It worked great for a couple of weeks, but now the up arrow is screwy and doesn't always register, which makes it extremely frustrating to play.  I estimate I got less than 20 hours of use before it started to fail on me, which is inexcusable.  In short this pad is not worth the money or trouble.  Look elsewhere.\n",
      "If you have any aspirations of actually becoming a decent Dance Dance Revolution player and moving up to the more challenging and satisfying songs, do not buy this pad -- or any soft pad, for that matter.Soft pads slide on the floor. They crumple and wrinkle up. They miss steps and fail to register sometimes. The surface feels the same all over, making it impossible to tell where your feet are without looking down.More advanced soft pads are available, which are thicker, but they still slide and have sensitivity problems.The only way to properly enjoy DDR at home is to purchase a metal pad. Just look up &quot;metal DDR pad&quot; on an internet auction site. Yes, they are expensive, but they'll also last for a very, very long time and put up with a lot of abuse. They also won't slide, will be extremely sensitive, and you can tell where your feet are without looking down. If you want the arcade experience at home, a metal pad is the only way to get it.\n",
      "First of all, what were the people who designed this mat thinking??? It's ugly and the colors clash. Also, soft mats slip around way too much. You can't beat hard songs and it is frustrating even getting good scores on the easy songs. The response on soft mats is unreliable and unpredictable. If you want to enjoy DDR, you're going to have to shell out for the expensive hard pads. Sorry people, there is no cheap way out of this one. And don't let any seller convince you that foam on the bottom of a soft mat or an anti-slip cover will make it better, because it won't.\n",
      "I got one of these because I thought it was a cool idea. I opened the box and it smelled like gasoline. I thought it would air out but it didn`t. In order to play it, you need to stand on your heels in order to not press the wrong buttons. It was almost impossible to press 2 buttons at once, plus there are no L or R buttons. Some of the other brands I tried were even worse. In short, it [stinks].\n",
      "To sum this game up in one word HORRIBLE . The graffics are weak beyond belief. The game play is agonizing and the storyline is so dumb an 8 year old couldn't enjoy it. This is one of the typical japanease anime games in which even the music is terribly japanease . I dont know maybe in japan this is a popular style of game but i cant get anyone to play it for more than 15 minutes before they beg me to put something else in. Id rather stab myself in the eye with a rusty pair of scissores than play this rancid game again.\n",
      "This game isn't even a game.You just go around grinding for 99% of it. Plus the music...Ahhhhh.... It isn't even music. It just makes these weird sounds the whole game except for one where there constantly swearing.If i were you i would actually by a game.\n",
      "CHEESY GRAPHICS BAD SOUNDTRACK WARNING: MAY CAUSE DEPRESSIONIT IS HORRIBLE!!...\n",
      "Not as good as the GameCube or PlayStation2 versions. I have both consoles XBOX and GameCube but I dont recommend buying this game for any console. I bought this for XBOX thinking it was the same as the GameCube and PlayStation2 versions. The vehicles dont have weapons on the XBOX version unless you earn the tank. Plus there are not as many cars on the Xbox version and all three versions have lousy graphics anyway.\n",
      "Before I start, I just want you to know that I own a Xbox system: I love the machine, I also love Halo. By no means am I just ragging on the system for no reason. The last 3 or 4 games I got for the Xbox have (...) WIND! (including this stupid game wrecklass. If you want to buy GRAND THEFT AUTO 3, just buy it; dont buy Xbox's lame version. Wrecklass is great looking, thats what sold me; but the game itself is way too coached and the story is weak. I was greatly disapointed with this game, I just hope Xbox comes out with better games in the future. Otherwise I will consider my Xbox to be the worlds most expensive paper weight.Wrecklass will be yet another Xbox game that I will end up trading in for hardly nothing.\n",
      "I rented this game and I played it for about 45 minutes. Then I turned it off. It was pretty bad for a couple reasons.1. You have a time limit, which is barely enough to complete the missions.2. The only way to blow up other cars is to run into them. This is so stupid because it takes a while for the damage to go down and there is traffic so you are constantly getting hit by other cars and then you have to catch up to the bad guys again.3.There are no weapons. This kind of goes along with #2 but this game could be a lot better if they were weapons, like twisted metal, except in a different style.4. There isn't much freedom. You can't just drive around like in GTA3, all you do is the missions, which get frustrating and so I turned it off.Just about the only good things in this game are the graphics. The streets and buildings are very realistic and so are the crashes.I don't reccomend this game at all. I think it was a wast of my 5 bucks to rent it, so it would absolutely be a waste of 50 bucks to buy it.\n",
      "Resident Evil is a name that most gamers know by heart as one of the most original and compelling games to grace the industry. It perfected the genre of Survival Horror and created a cult following immediately. Even today it is one of the most successful franchises in game history and definitely a large part of the bread and butter at CAPCOM. However it did not achieve this status for nothing. With every CLASSIC game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system. The Resident Evil series from the beginning was developed with exploration and puzzle solving in mind. Then the graphical presentation was developed to supply enough detail and interest that a person would actually want to explore it. The setting, in a mansion full of horror story influences, was perfect for the type of game style that was being developed. At the time they used static backgrounds due to the fact that the Sony Playstation system couldn't display enough polygons to make a believable environment. But doing it this way also proved to make the graphical presentation much smoother and more detail rich. Later the series would try full 3D in Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast, and then return to it's roots on GameCube in perhaps the best looking game to date. Resident Evil Gaiden for GBC was perhaps an unrealistic attempt from the beginning. The gameplay has completely changed so dramatically that it becomes a new game with a Resident Evil logo. It resembles more of a Metal Gear 8-bit Nintendo game from the 80's than a Resident Evil game. The battle system is completely boring and overly hard. It is more like a game of golf because you have to hit the button at the right time on a progress bar that scrolls left to right before you can shoot a zombie in combat mode. It's tricky and timing is everything. But, more importantly it just doesn't fit the RE universe and it is a poor attempt to port a name over to a dead handheld system with way too little power for such a detail/exploration latent game as RE. The graphics are horrible even for GBC standards and the battle system is poorly developed and there is no since this is even a RE game at all. Invest in something else, anything else. For 20 bucks more you could have RE for GameCube, the best RE there is. Stay away from this game I promise you will be taking it back the next day to trade for something else. It IS that BAD!\n",
      "This game is absolutely terrible. I tried it out at the store first then decided to buy it.  What a mistake.  This game is so dark, it's hard to see where you're going.  It's actually a really difficult game and there are very few spots in the game that allow you to save.  I don't recommend this game to anyone.\n",
      "Ugh.. this game was terrible.  I will admit, the graphics we're pretty good, but that's all I will say that it positive about it.  The controls are the absolute worst.  There's so much going on at once and you're trying to figure out how to control your character.. you just get frustrated.  Atleast I did.  If you want to try it, rent it first.\n",
      "Get the Xbox version, which has better graphics, Dolby 5.1 surround sound (makes a HUGE difference), and easier controls.  Even the controller vibration seems a little more engaging on the Xbox.\n",
      "First things first, I'm a big PS2 fanboy.  I have a PS2 and I don't even want the others.  There is one thing about this game though that really irks me, EA already has it made for PS2 without a multiplayer, and they are GOING to release it for Gamecube and X-Box with multiplayer.  What is it with EA?  Why do they always have to make better products for the other systems?  PS2 is just as good as the others...\n",
      "come on i bought the game on the first day it came out and i beat the game on that first day it's just too easy to beat the first level is fun ,but that's the only level that's fun goshyou can't even get in a tank or fighter plane!! ...\n",
      "This game is terriable. I cant believe people gave this game a good rating. Realistic? You cant even kill your own allies. Thats realistic? You people know nothing about video games. The game is linear and it seems that the allies would have lost the war without you, you end up doing everthing. The history lesson after each mission was boring and should have never been put in the game. The symphony music sounded like you were at a funeral. This game is not as good as everyone claims it is.\n",
      "There's a method a lot of developers use to keep a race tight, in a racing game - it's called &quot;rubber band&quot; AI. Rather than having each individual computer opponent actually race, as they might in real life, their speed is tied directly to your speed. If you slow down, they slow down. If you speed up, they speed up. In theory, this keeps races close, and exciting.In Sled Storm, it makes them obnoxiously difficult, and takes any semblance of &quot;fun&quot; out of racing. It takes the &quot;race&quot; out of racing, in fact. You can hit every shortcut, every turbo boost, and not make a single mistake throughout the entireity of a 10 minute long race, and if you make a minor mistake at the end, you can go from 1st place to 6th in less than half a second, with no way to recover. This isn't an issue of making a huge mistake, and falling behind, it's an issue that no matter how well you know a track, and can exploit it, you'll *never* get more than half a second ahead of last place.As a result, Sled Storm isn't a racing game, it's a game about not making any mistakes, ever. It's not fun, it's not interesting, it's a horrible way to have implemented the computer &quot;AI&quot;, and it makes the game so utterly pointless and worthless that it's not likely I will ever play it again.\n",
      "As the review title implies, I despise this game.  Sled Storm for the PS2 is a huge disappointment.  The graphics are ugly primary-color polygons with no texture, the tracks look like they were all stolen from SSX games, the &quot;snowmobiles&quot; sound like someone swatting at angry hornets with a rusty chainsaw, and the tracks are way too linear.  No off-track exploration here, folks.  If you see this game, just ignore it and walk away.\n",
      "For some reason, EA BIG decided to make a third SSX game, only involving snowmobiles instead of snowboards. If you decide to explore the tracks looking for shortcuts, you will find yourself crashing upon contact with thin air. The tracks themselves are [similiar to] SSX tracks, with the ever-present clown and carnival theme that EA BIG loves to incorporate in all their racing games. the snowmobiles sound like garbage, the graphics are polygons. Crashing into thin air is the real frustrating part... there is an invisible barrier on both sides, on top and under the linear track that forces the driver to run the track like a roller coaster. this game is garbage, plain and simple. The only demographic I think this CD ROM would satisfy are kids under the age of seven. SSX was good, but EA BIG is really running the linear roller-coaster type racing games into the ground fast.\n",

      "I am a huge fan of the pirate game genre, so I was excited to see this game in the XBOX section of the store.  I have owned most pirate games for the PC.If you're expecting Sea Dogs or anything close to the old Pirates game on the PC, with Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat, you will be as disappointed as I was with this game.This game might be good for kids learning to play video games, although it is violent.  Since I am not a kid, I grew bored of this game after an hour.  I will probably never play it again.The game play is extremely linear.It would be a good game for elementary school children, if it didn't have all the violence.Basically it's not kid enough for kids and not adult enough for adults.  It's just plain bad.If you need a crummy game fix, buy it at Amazon.  They have the lowest price anywhere for this game.\n",
      "This game [is bad]. I think that Goldeneye, The world is not Enough, and Tommorow Never Dies are by far the best of the Bond games. I think that this was not a good idea.

      "I got this card and it erased my entire football team which took hours to create and my Bond game which took me a week to beat.  When I returned it to Toys'R'Us the Video Games sales clerk nerd told me that 99% of the people that bought this memory card from their store returned it with numerous complaints.  What else is there to say?  If you buy it, it might work but if it doesn't!  Everything is gone.  One friend of mine even got one of his games broken from this memory card!  PLEASE DO NOT MAKE the same mistake I made and get this Memory Card!  Interact is a SHAME!\n",
      "I two lost game saves on this card.  Uniquely enough it was only my Pikmin game that was causing problems.  My other game saves still worked.  But I didn't keep it around long to figure if the other game saves would get corrupt.I sold ...[it]back to Electronics Boutique and bought the Nintendo Puny 59 memory card, which has not ever failed.  Now that Nintendo has a larger memory card, do yourself a favor and buy the Nintendo card.\n",
      "Firstly, you can save a maximum of 127 games to a card, not blocks. Of you could only save 127 blocks, the memory card 251wouldn't exist along with some upcoming SD memory card accessories. I thought this was a great card for a while but then it blew. So maybe it is true that I did have a couple save files equal to about 130 blocks and my memory card did feel pretty hot after Bomberman. But no card should die like that!! My recommendation is to go with the Memory card 251 by Nintendo. Nintendo cards are a lot sturdier. I am thankful that the card would just no longer save, rather than deleting my data and I could just move it over\n",
      "I didn't believe that this card could really be as bad as everyone said on here, but boy was I wrong, it will let me save a file maybe 1 or 2 times, but if i go to overwrite it it would say corrupt data, and force me to format all my saves..luckily i kept backups on my nintendo brand memory card 59 though. i no longer trust interact.\n",
      "This game really upset me. I was looking forward to playing it and the game had some stupid qlitch in it that made it unable to start once I installed it.  BUYER BEWARE! I could not find help for the problem and so I sold the game.  I also read other reviews that the game is good but no real multiplayer, unless you like only one on one battles and no real replayability, I would wait for something better that you can play again and again and it be a new adventure every time.  P.S.- Star Wars Galaxies RPG online- check out the reviews! its not superhero but its better than that... super space heros online.\n",
      "After being burnt on game after game- Morrowind- Black and White- Civ 3- all highly-touted games that failed to deliver even the slightest degree of gameply enjoyment, I decided to stick my neck out and purchase Freedom force- \"what the hey?\"  I thought- \"The law of averages will eventually yield up a decent game, and I've heard good reviews...\"Needless to say- Burned again!Freedom force is an abysmal little game- a horrendous, cumbersome interface that makes gameplay confusing and erratic.  Enemies that can run off the edge of the map and attack you at a distance- yet cannot be attacked.  Your \"Heroes\" might as well be named \"Idiot man and Stupid boy\", as they will stand idly around at let themselves be attacked and shot at, and not defend themselves.  Graphic glitches out the wazoo.  You have to click on an enemy sometimes as many as four times before your hero will attack...Seriously- I've been playing video and computer games for 18 years- ever since the first \"Ultima\" game came out for the apple 2- and I have never seen such an onslaught of inferior products being foisted into the market...What has happened to the art of game design?

I returned it to see if it was my computer that is the problem but it is very common for hitman 2 to crash on windows XP. so if it says \"Direct3D : unable to create device. Try changing resolution or color depth\" and on XP. Return it immediately. I returned it and got it on Xbox.\n",
      "A lot of Survival Horror games get a bad rep. for possessing painfully clunky controls and too much back-tracking, but they all seem to be directed at the wrong games and never at the right game. The right game to blame for the worse controls known to man in Survival Horror gaming goes to one game and if not just this one, then the rest of the franchise that spawned from it: FATAL FRAME.Tecmo had a lot of unique ideas going through their heads for this game, but apparently the one thing they weren't thinking of was the one aspect that would've made this game worth the constant praise it gets.Does this make any sense? You're playing the entire game as a nineteen year old girl who walks and runs slower than a drunk elephant. Plus, the controls are permanently in 2D meaning that up will force your character to do a 180 and walk in the direction you point her in. Fine in theory, but you have to realize that using 2D controls in a 3D game based entirely off of exploration and using set camera angles that change every time you move to a different room or fight ghosts is not a good idea.What's worse is that enemies you face in this game move so fast and use up 99.8% of the terrain to their advantage that it's next to impossible to try and hurt them without taking any damage in return. The ghosts are also so vocal, whiny and badly spoken that their dialogue literally murders any atmosphere they had. Plus, I need to argue: who would be terrified of blue ghost children tromping after you with their arms in the air? It's like the game developers were trying to piss you off rather than scare you.The game is very innovative and unique what with using a camera as a weapon and fighting ghosts as your main enemy, but facing such unfair, aesthetically awkward, questionably malevolent enemies with such unfair controls is about as fun and scary as being chased by a shag carpet in tennis shoes.\n",

      "That's all you need to know about &quot;Test Drive&quot;, rubberband AI and Pong.  Those are the only two things the game developers put any thought into and it just kills what possibly could've been a fun game.It's been said before and I'm gonna say it again in my review.  The load times for this game are outrageous.  Really awful.  They're so bad that you are given the chance to play Pong while you wait.  Sure...it's fun for about three games but then the next couple hundred times are boring.  You just want the game to load up already.The load times would be tolerable if the game was worth the wait...which it's not!  I don't know who first developed the whole rubberband AI concept but I have spent the better part of the last decade cursing them.  Could someone please explain to me what the point of getting good at a game is if it makes no difference whatsoever?  Why should I get to know the tracks and improve my powerslides if I don't have to?  You could let your cat play this game up until there's about 30 seconds left before the end of the track.  Then you just pick up the controller from your precious little Snowball and zoom past your opponents.  How silly.The inability to fall far behind the computer racers makes this game a great title for kids and people who don't ever play racing games.  They'll be proud of themselves for always being in every race.  That's cool for them but a grave disappointment to those of us who want something that provides a challenge.  Poor graphics and repetitive gameplay make this a game most of you should skip, unless it's dirt cheap in a bargain bin somewhere.\n",

      "So I mark Warcraft III as the point where the franchise stopped being WARcraft, and became MAGEcraft, or Magiccraft, or some stupid snippy pun regarding a favor towards magic rather than war.And don't worry, this negative review isn't all just about the visceral hatred of high fantasy involving lots of magic.  The game itself has plenty of bad flaws.I used to love Warcraft. But I hate Warcraft since they made it \"Blizzard presents: Magic: The Gathering\".My favorite thing about Warcraft was exactly what they took out in III and World of: a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy. There were no \"Thyalawynd\" or \"Darkheart\"s or \"Ebonheart\"s or \"Gyilwind\"s magic fantasy crap with gravity-defying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even blood.There was no \"We ah the Knoights of Lothar the Guilywind, son of Gunther the Loinhearted, son of Baxter the Baxton, son of Aragorn of Aragorn, and we foight fo peeeeeace\" versus \"Graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moves\".Warcraft wasn't like that at all---Warcraft had the Orcs coming into Azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war, and rather than accomodate, the Humans responded with war. And it blew up in their faces as the Orcs destroyed Stormwind Keep and forced the humans into Lothleroin, with the Orcs following. I don't remember what happened after that, but I think eventually the Orcs were beaten back by the Alliance of Humans and Elves.Then I completely do not remember a single thing about Warcraft III other than Taurens supporting the Orcs for absolutely no reason, and the Undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and Night Elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of Godwynn EverNeverwind P. Dark-Ebonheart.Warcraft and Warcraft II were to me, the modern Medieval-fantasy equivalent of Conan the Barbarian, in that yes, magic was there, and magic was used, but only the magicians practiced magic, and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion Orc Grunts and Troll Axethrowers.  Sure, then there came Ogre-Mages, Death Knights, Paladins, and the like, but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh, not just magic.Instead in Warcraft III, and extending into World of Warcraft, magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army.  You can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like, but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeep.But while magic would become the more central point beyond Warcraft III, War3's focus instead came upon HEROES!The entire RTS aspect of this game is not fully broken, but rather fractured by not just the inclusion, but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes, who have dozens of hero-only chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them MORE powerful, and they have the ability to LEVEL UP and research MORE abilities and powers.At least half the missions in the campaign I was apart of either involved playing ONLY as heroes, or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battles.Then, UPKEEP.The idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like Total War or in real life.  Upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army.  Upkeep does not exist in traditional RTS games.In this game, upkeep means \"you no longer mine as many resources\" when you have too many units.  And \"too many\" ranges from 50-75 population points taken up.And then comes the fact that full-army battles are rendered impossible when the average Orc Grunt starts costing THREE population points, and the maximum population is no longer the Blizzard standard of 200, but somewhere near 125-175 or so.Controlling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather 7 of a resource rather than ten.  Medium upkeep reduces it to 5.  High upkeep reduces it to 3.  And an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their size.This is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map.  But another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective, the player is basically forced into an arm's race with their opponents, to build up their base technologies, upgrade all they can, then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the 90% of other units available to train, just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thing.And then again, the RTS idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible, and to hell with all other available units.This is not how a good RTS works.  Starcraft comes to mind: an army of 30 basic Terran Marines can slaughter an enemy army of Hydralisks or Ultralisks.  An army of 30 Battlecruisers seems unstoppable, and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few Corsairs or Valkyries, or a flood of Scourges.  Or they can be broken up from all-out attack from an Arbiter's stasis, or a Ghost's lockdown.  They can suffer huge splash damage from Psionic Storms from High Templar or Infested Kerrigan.In short, in Starcraft, every unit is effective if utilized properly.  You can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units, and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the like.Warcraft III has none of it.  Every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder and/or base defense until that superunit or hero is available for building.And so what was once \"WARcraft\" and I so deridingly called \"Magecraft\" could more accurately be called \"Herocraft\", because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game, EVEN the skirmishes, as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side.  AND you can get MORE THAN ONE hero on a map, one for heavy combat, one for support, and one for magic.\n",
      "Three words for this franchise: \"Out of gas\". Warcraft 1 and 2 were excellent games, however, as with Blizzard's last few outings, this game falls well short of where it should be; offering nothing new or any kind of originality to the RTS genre. In game hero system? Warlords Battlecry 2 does it better... Great graphics? hardly, colorful, cartoonish triangles if anything else...Gameplay? eh.. boring after the first couple missions or so, no new missions of any kind to add life into this genre. Finally, the story is why this game gets one star.. It does have a fairly decent storyline, however, not up to par with some of the other great RPG storylines.\n",
      "Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them \"limited\" accounts (a recommended \"best practice\" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to \"user-level\" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game.Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Warcraft III is an excellent game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation.More information on this issue is available at:[...]\n",
      "Gamblers have it the worst in the video game department. For every half decent gambling related game that comes out (i.e. Multiplay Video Poker, Real Deal Slots, Slots II), there are twenty released that are complete junk. This is one of them...You play Steve Wynn, in so many words, by taking a poorly run casino and attempting to make it into something spectacular. The concept is great, but the execution is awful. The casinos themselves are poorly-rendered ripoffs of the Luxor, Excalibur, Treasure Island, and Binion's Horseshoe. They even managed to do really creepy looking renditions of Siegfried and Roy (apparently they own the Excalibur in this game.) The only original casino is one that looks like an old 50's style jukebox.So, what machines do you have to choose from? Slots, Video Poker, and Video Blackjack. That's it. What table games do you have? Blackjack and Craps. If you move up the ranks, you'll get Roulette, Pai-Gow, and a Wheel of Fortune table. Wow. The graphics on this game are so generic you really can't tell the difference between slot machines and blackjack machines. The craps tables are only barely distinguishable from the other tables. It's really awful how you supposedly have a variety of slot machines, yet they all look the same. Not that it matters as you can't play any of them and having different machines doesn't affect the game anyway. The gameplay is completely generic. It's a matter of, build enough items and the casino will fill up. I really don't see any advantage of using one machine over another or table games versus machines for that matter. Just dump enough items on the floor and you'll advance to the next level. Exciting, huh?I'll get really nitpicky now. The restaurants and shops you build? Just 2D images you paste on a wall. That's it. You can't go into these \"wallpaper\" shops or change anything about them (except you're able to offer keno in the restaurants - big deal!) Would it have been so difficult to allow us to adjust the prices on the items we sell? That's just one example. Add the fact the customers all say the same thing over and over and the fact the music is the same song over and over and you get the feeling a lot of corners were cut to rush this game out the door.Supposedly you can adjust how much the pit bosses give out in comps. If that's true, I've never seen anything happen. All they do is stand around and do nothing. (Ok, maybe that part of the game is realistic.) You can view how much cash customers have, but not how much cash they've spent - defeats the whole purpose of giving comps doesn't it? Speaking of which, if you click on a drunk customer he or she will start babbling like a drunk. Give them a comp and all of a sudden the speech sounds normal. Wow, I didn't know comps sober people up. The heavily-accented asian customers say things like \"are any of the waitresses for sale?\" If I had a politically correct bone in my body I'd think that sounds like a racist stereotype.You can set the house edge on the games to somehow control how much money you collect.  How is this done?  By using a slider bar you set from low to medium to high.  Think about this for a second.  Anyone remotely familiar with gambling (the editor who chopped this section out of my review isn't one of them) knows you can change the odds on a slot machine but you can't change the odds on most table games.  So how do you get more money out of them?  Are you putting a magnet on the roulette wheel?  Are you using loaded dice on the craps table?  I could go on and on, but I think you get my point.  The game is just totally unrealistic and nothing like what's really involved in operating a casino.The best economic sim released recently is Virtual Resort: Spring Break.  If the subject matter doesn't appeal to you and you must have a gambling tycoon game, then search for a copy of Casino Tycoon.  It's better, but not by much.  Better yet, save your money, or come to Vegas and bet it all on red or a hand of blackjack.  Even if you lose you'll have more fun than you will playing this game.Hope the review helped.\n",
      "No wonder wwhy this game went to greatest hits so quick.Their are no story lines, confusing moves,and it is practically impossible to beat the game on Kumity mode. If you like fighting games, Get Tekken Games.\n",

      "Yes,I like watching the simpsons on tv,no I do not like playing simpsons video games cause they're horrible!This has been going on since 8bit nintendo,and developers still can't make a decent simpsons game.If they really wanted to make a great simpsons video game,then they should release the original simpsons arcade game(the one you had to pop quarters into) on a console.I don't know why that hasn't been done yet,cause THAT was a simpsons game I had a blast playing esp. when 4 people could play at the same time!As for simpsons skateboarding,a big thumbs down!!\n",
      "The simpsons is one of the weirdest shows. they just got even worst. This game is also way too hard. The simpsons should be taken off the air so should all the other adult programs. Now the charecters sware even more, they get into more trouble unpurpis, and they just got evenb more violent.\n",
      "I'm seeing a disturbing trend in games featuring the Simpsons. First there was \"Simpson's Road Rage\" which was Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters, which was half decent. But when they tried to apply the Simpsons to the Tony Hawk formula, they fell flat on their face, much like you will find youself doing quite often if you play this game. The controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable. The physics will not allow you to do what you'd like to do, making many of the goals completely unrealistic. The only thing this game has going for it are its graphics.Bottom line: If you are going to buy this game, make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the controls, because otherwise you will put it down after fifteen minutes and never have a desire to play it again. If you are a big fan of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series and big Simpson's fan, do not buy this game thinking you will get the best of both worlds because you will be very disappointed.\n",
      "*sigh*.  This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played.  I went back to the video rental store and demanded for my money back after playing this...  If you have ever played Tony Hawk, then you will notice that the moves are opposite and slow.  If you havent played Tony Hawk, get that instead.  If you have played Tony Hawk, run away from this game!\n",
      "Let me start by saying that I am a comic book fan, and I know my super heroes.  I was looking forward to this game ever since I heard about it, and I was extraordinarily disappointed when I played it.  Now, let me also say that this game is very beautiful.  The graphics are amazing, but everything else is completely mediocre, and most of the time just plain bad.  The biggest complaint one can muster is of the control scheme.  Seeing as how the controls drive the entire game, this tends to ruin the experience.  Amazingly stiff controls and not-at-all-innovative use of gadgets plague this title.  You try to punch a guy and you get shot by a hail of bullets, which causes you to fall to the floor every time, so you can't fight back.  This is on the first level mind you.  You try to execute a move and the camera suddenly switches directly in front of you, thus reversing controls and making you miss.  You try to jump, but the controls are so stiff and unpolished that you only go straight up.  Now, assuming you have enough skill and attention span to get past the horrible fights that occur every few seconds and get to a boss fight, you won't win.  Not for a long time anyway.  If you do, congratulations, you play too many video games.  The very first boss- Black Mask- totes double magnums.  You come near him- which is necessary to defeat him- and you get pulverized with three or four shots.  This doesn't even scratch the surface of the problems with this game.  Let's move onto the story.  I'm sure you've heard all this garbage about Final Fantasy's Kenji Terada.  Well, looks like he lost his touch.  You'll find more originality in a James Bond movie.  The plot goes something like this:  Evil, evil people have conjured up an evil-satellite-death-ray and are planning to take over the world, but \"he\" is going to stop them.  Make sure you don't forget to try and be dramatic by emphasizing \"he\" and \"him\" instead of saying \"Batman.\"  You wouldn't want to sound normal.  Well, I've said enough.  Don't buy it.\n",
      "This game really stunk in the graphic's area....the people look like blobs, and mostly just float across the rooms. My two year old could have done a better job creating this game than whoever did...Do not buy unless you just really want to be bored and frustrated...\n",
      "If you are a fan of some of the better simulation games, like the SimCity series, or even Tropico, etc., don't buy this game.  The graphics are substandard, the gameplay is boring and unimaginative, and the interface is less than intuitive.  This game is a blatant attempt to cash in on the reputation of some of the more succesful and better-made tycoon games.\n",
      "I received this game for Christmas, and I was very disappointed in the graphics and the game play. It's the worst tycoon game ever. I can't my family payed full price for this tycoon reject. Roller coaster Tycoon, Airline Tycoon, Sim city, Zoo Tycoon, etc, all have great game play and is very addictive, unlike this game.On the box it says, \"A completely 3D world.\" That is total false, it's basically has 8-bit graphics (the type of graphics that were on the super Nintendo video game consoles.)Another problem I have faced was that the game crashed a lot! You have to save frequently, and it takes forever to save. It's just like The Sims, it take 2 minutes to save! I loaded this game on my Windows 2000 and would crash when you got to the preloader. Then I bought a Windows XP and it would crash every 30 to 60 minutes.I hope I made an impact on your decision not to buy this game it's not worth the money and it has many flaws. If you want to just try the game buy it used.\n",
      "Opened up a new line of genre, very unique gameplay and expansive environment. But riddled with glitches and imperfections. Enough so, to make this very frustrating. Almost seems impossible at times. Fun for a few hours, but afterwards i wouldnt ever play it again. Not worth the money.\n",
      "GTA3 is indeed an amazing game.  It has a large environment, decent graphics and decent gameplay.  But it's too often unnecessarily complicated.  Some of the missions are next to impossible to finish, which makes the game more frustrating than needed.  I really tried to like the game...\n",
      "What a crying shame. GTA3 is an amazing game, but I wouldn't know. Rockstar did such a ...poor job of porting this game to the PC, it almost seems like they're mocking us non-sony gamers. Anyone who can install this game and play it immediately without needing hours of technical support and screaming at your monitor must have some gift from God. The technical support, by the way, is not available to call on weekends, and it takes a minimum of 72 hours for an e-mail response. I'm not waiting nearly a week to be told that it's not compatible. My Pentium 4 computer works like a dream, but it's still not enough. It works poorly (if at all) with an optical mouse, it doesn't show text at all, the graphics are absolutely abysmal and choppy, and the blood stains are pretty much red boxes on the ground. Pity. A word of advice, listen to these other reviews and skip this unacceptable piece of garbage. Get the PS2 version, or a PC game that's actually playable.\n",
      "This game had so many conflicts with existing drivers on my system I never was able to play it (even though my system exceeds all recommendations and requirements stated).  After spending 3 days writing exhaustive emails to so-called customer support, and downloading drivers for nearly every piece of hardware on my system, all their recommendations led up to the unsolvable error, &quot;GTA3 requires at least 12MB of free video memory.&quot;  I have 128MB of free video memory, but the game cannot recognize this.  All my other games play with no hitches, but I will be returning this one.\n",
      "I know there is a lot of hype for this game. The new GTAIII Vice City is supposed to be another hit with newer cars and things of that nature. But Aside from all the killing and blowing up stuff, is there really anything else that captures the immagination in this game? I've seen friends play this over and over again saying how great it is. So I get it and play it. After 20 min of missions of killing things and blowing stuff up with practically no sense of purpose and any form of variety in the missions, I had to uninstall this game. Its horrible!!!  If you love games where its mindless killing (filled with great codes I should add), then go for it. But If you need a plot with an actual challenge that stimulates the mind, then you might want to go another route.\n",
      "As a lover of Street, I was very excited to hear about this game and bought it immediately. To my surprise, its not even a tenth as good. This game is five on five with only street players (i had a feeling that was coming, with no NBA endorsement on the cover) and boring backdrops. There is just too much going on on the court in order to really have fun with street style moves. I also think the arial attack could be made more interesting. It plays like a generic basketball game with the addition of ankle breaking moves, which is a big step down from NBA Street, which was more like the Arcade NBA Jam style of ballin'. I returned this game after a day, and bought Slugfest instead. At least I can punch gayrod now.\n",
      "This is seriously the worst game ever made.  It plays like a ... version of NBA Live 2002, only it ... way more.  ...  ....  The graphics are bad, the sound is bad, and game play is bad.  I rented this game from Blockbuster, then took it back to them and demanded a different game it was so bad.  Don't even rent it if it's free.\n",
      "Eidos really dropped the ball here, folks.  As usual the story is great, although there are a few notable inconsistancies that will hopefully be explained in the next game.  However, the poor controls and obvious lack of beta testing kill this game.  First, to attack you have to target an enemy.  Usually not a problem, but while targeting, you cannot jump. You can also only dodge left-right, not back or jumping.  Second, while sucking blood, you're stuck in the equivalent of a very repetitive cutscene, where you are still vulnerable to attack though can do nothing to avoid the blow.  Third, if you die, you have to watch any cutscenes between you and the last checkpoint over again, no way to skip them.As for glitches, there are hundreds if not more.  Clipping is horrible, people fall through walls.  Not a problem, unless you wanted their weapon.  Well into the game, many people, myself included, lose the ability to save, by either getting a Save Failed message or a corrupt new file, which has led to a few people having to start over.  As much as I love the story, this hardly seems worth the hassle and frustration of playing a game Eidos and Crystal Dynamics failed so horrifically on.\n",
      "This series keeps getting worse.  The first game, for the PS1, was good.  The second in the series, Soul Reaver, was fairly entertaining.  The third, Soul Reaver II, was so-so, but far too short.  Blood Omen II is just plain bad.  On the plus side, the urban feel of the level design is a nice change from the rest of the series where the developers focused more on ancient ruins, canyons, and forests.  On the down side, game play is sluggish, at best.  The controls are not responsive, making fight sequences tedious.  The dialog during the cut scenes is totally off.  I don't mean by a second or two, I'm talking about voices coming from the wrong characters.  Sometimes the soundtrack is nonexistent.  On top of that, ambient sounds have a tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating themselves over and over, drowning out every other sound.  The only remedy is to restart the game.  I have also had some problems with the graphics.  On occasion, when I enter a new area, the entire screen, aside from Kain, goes blank.  Once again, the only effective remedy I have found is to restart the game.  I've used other discs on my console, so I know my system isn't on the blink.  Last, but not least, this game suffers from the curse of mandatory cut scenes.  I'm tired of having to sit through long, drawn out movies with no bypass option every time I replay a section of the game.  I really wish I could give this game a better review, seeing that the developers must have put some sort of time and effort into making it, but I can't\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT'S A DEFINITE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and in the end it's a game controller thrown across the room. Especially when you have to beat the bosses!!This is the end of the line for eidos games for me!!!!!! If you love eidos and you play this eidos game YOU WILL NEVER WANT ONE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!Fair warning \"DON'T PLAY THIS EIDOS GAME\" just clear it from your mind.(PS,it is fun at first until you get to a boss stage that is.)\n",
      "Ok, as for the title of this review, I'll get back to that later. But as for the game itself...it's awful. You run through these maze-like levels, pounding the buttons, sometimes stopping to solve boring, switch/door \"puzzles\" (they didn't even bother with boxes). You cannot move the camera; the levels are so linear, your view so limited, that this might as well be 2-D.Yet, creating a mindless, boring button-masher wasn't enough for Midway. They had to go and add \"RPG elements\". Which means that they take the ABSOLUTE WORST PART of the RPG genre--endless experience grinding. You see, merely mashing buttons is not enough. You must mash buttons through the same levels over and over in order to level up enough, otherwise your chances of beating the game are shot.And also, although the rest of the game is ridiculously easy, you'll never win if you can't get the special items to defeat the bosses. Which, of course, are near-impossible to get.Now that that's off my chest, I'll explain the title. This game stole dozens of hours of my friend's life. She can't beat it on her own, because the difficulty is ridiculous, so she just enters the invincibility code over and over, and blows through the game time and time again....She's over her \"Gauntlet phase\" now, thank goodness, but for a while there it was all she did...Don't get this game. Seriously. Real gamers will be bored out of their skulls; casual gamers, like my friend, are at risk of getting addicted. Now go buy something better. Like a game by Nintendo.\n",
      "Those 3 words are- sloppy,stupid, and ugly. After playing this game, I am so happy that I bought 007 instead. As you know both are ports of ps2 games, with one major difference- james bond has actually been improved on, and spy hunter has been cut up. It is an extremely sloppy port from the ps2 version. Graphics just plain stink, pretty much no real damage to anything at all, and it gets boring faster than the levels can load. There are driving levels on james bond, and, sad to say, they are better than this whole game! And you get to shoot suff and have multiplayer. But seriously, on the driving 007 levels there is real damage and all the weapons and gadgets of spy hunter, so just get it and have fun running into ped cars.\n",
      "I rented this game an couple of weeks ago, and was EXTREMELY dissapointed. The graphics are sloppy and the car handles like a 30 year old junker form the junkyard. It slides around on turnes, and accelerates very poorly. For some \"super souped-up\" spy car, it isnt very impressive. The gameplay is poor, and the weapons control is hard to learn between guns and defensive weapons. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!The movies between levels are very bad andOVERALL: 3/10\n",
      "-1 star-Graphics-The graphics are terrible compared to any other game. Even of its not baseball, The graphics are inacceptable. All the people look the same accept for their race, and the outfit they are wearing. Half the players dont even have a picture.-1 star-gameplay-This game was SOOOOOOOOO poorly made. In the easiest difficulty i lost 8-5. With the same teams in 2 harder difficulties, i won 35-0!!Also, u ALWAYS get away with stealing from first to second, but u NEVER be safe stealing from second to third.-1 star- This game gets boring sOO eaily becuase it only has 2 good modes. There is practice, and exibition which is the same. Home run derby WHICH IS TERRIBLE BECUASE U CANT FACE THE COMPUTER!, and a season which is terrible because half way through the season u always get a roster problom which is impossible to fix.-1 star-Crashes easily and takes 25 minutes to instal- this game which is about 300 meg took 25 minutes to install on my SUPER good 1.2 ghz amd athelon pc. Diablo 2 which is 1 gig, 3 TIMES THE AMOUNT!, took 3 minutes to install. Also, when u play this and u forget to close ur instant messeges, and u get an instant messege, the game minimizes. ONCE IT MINIMIZES, SAY GOOD BYE!! cuase once u click on the game to bring it back the screen turns black and it freezes.Do not buy this game!\n",
      "For the past three off-the-shelf versions of High Heat there have been bugs galore.I will name only the first three that come to mind...You can't watch your team play in manager only mode... if you try it will kick you to your desktop after the top half of the first inning.Trying to play Home Run Derby can make your computer hang.Yet again, snafu with transferring seasons from older versions of the game.I'm sure the game itself will be great once it is patched.  So do yourself a favor and wait until it is.  Even at the low shelf price it's not worth the frustration yet.\n",

      "That pretty much sums it up. The first Getaway was fantastic in my opinion. It was original enough to be great. Shooting around walls was awesome. Getting lost was fun in itself because I could marvel at London. Say goodbye to that.Black Monday is flat out terrible. There were some problems with the original Getaway, but I could overlook them as I fell in love with the game. Black Monday fixes nothing, it actually has caused a ton of problems itself.The first apartment you raid is absolutely stupid. The main problem is that the camera is jerky. You can always see what you need to see, but when you move the camera jerks to follow you. You will notice this right at the start of the game.Another problem is how easy this game is. Enemies can't hit anything. Even at point-blank range, the enemies don't seem to be able to hold their gun straight. I walked up to about 30 dudes and just handcuffed them. While I was handcuffing them everyone stopped and politely waited for me to finish. The fighting in the game is stupid as well because you just walk up and punch dudes. Occasionaly you can grab them, then turn them around and snap their necks. It is so unbelievably boring.The worst idea was putting in the crappy stealth missions. They are horrible. EVERY GAME WANTS TO DO THIS NOW! Almost every game I play puts you in a stupid stealth mission that just drags. STOP MAKING STEALTH MISSIONS! I just played Shadow of Rome, and the stealth missions are pure crap. I love Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, but honestly, those are the only times I appreciate stealth. The stealth missions in this game consist of you walking around, occasionaly hiding until a guard leaves. I don't think they tested this game with real people. Had they of done that, they would of been told to take out the stealth missions and kill themselves for making such a horrible game.London is recreated perfectly. The only problem is, I don't care. Now you have a map option. To me, this is a terrible idea. The whole concept of the original Getaway is realism. Sure, you could buy a map. When you're driving alone though you can't freeze the time continum and take a break to see what road you need next. You will use the map function only to finish this game so you can take it back. I only got 17 dollars for it. I'm surprised they even took it back, seeing as how horrible it is.The graphics are terrible. Blah blah blah. Everything about this game is bad. I'm just so mad I spent fifty dollars on it. Truthfully, this game is flat out terrible and I don't think they will be creating another Getaway anytime soon. If they do, I think it will be the first game in history to sell zero copies.\n",
      "dont get this unless you have a specific intention for it. if you just want to buy cool gamecube accessories stay away from this!  it does not function for many games at all, and even though it is a cool idea, i sold mine as fast as possible after i learned of its minimal capabilities.  a product like this has potential, but definately wait until some good game comes out that supports it in a big way. dont let any review that says that its good without giving specific reasons of specific games that it is good for.\n",

      "Having loved the Aki/Asmik WWE games on N64 (Wrestlemania &amp; No Mercy), i've been looking forward to this for a long time, &amp; i've never been more disappointed by a game in my life. The game has been developed by Yukes, who did the Smackdown series on PS1 &amp; 2' &amp; while it looks very impressive when running on demo, it's awful to play. No story modes, no interference, a lack of some characters real theme tunes, a criminal lack of moves &amp; the worst blocking system in the history of gaming. It plays like a very rushed, unfinished game, &amp; is simply no fun to play at all. Avoid like the plague.\n",
      "Before I begin this review, I'm not going to pick on anyone else's review on Amazon, but I will state that this is my personal opinion of the abomination that is Wrestlemania X8.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics for this game aren't the best; and there's no excuse being that the majority of Gamecube games have excellent graphics. Still, I'm at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth, and the framerate is consistent, but man o' man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap. In fact, most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible. The arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures, however, the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at 2-frame loops.Nothing special to talk about here. The wrestlers don't sell moves, generally do not look hurt and aren't exactly too accurate in size. Generic, boring graphics galore.Sound-One redeeming quality of Wrestlemania X8 would be the sound...and that's as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad. The music is really good. Each theme is accurate and a lot better than I anticipated. Just don't expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thud.There's no commentary which really sucks. I often wondered why WWE games for Gamecube couldn't have commentary when Ultimate Muscle- Legends vs new generation for Gamecube does.Gameplay-Here's the really bad part, as if the sound and graphics weren't bad enough, in comes the incredibly boring gameplay.Westlemania X8 does feature a decent enough roster, but the moves are limited and that's the main problem with this game. The movesets given to each wrestler is about 5 or so moves, a finisher, running attacks, standing attacks and some ground attacks. On paper, this wouldn't be bad, but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam, suplex, as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks. Even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptions.The match types wouldn't be bad if this game was better. You get single, tag team, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Cage, Rumble, Handicap and some other match types.The roster could've been really good, but the graphics are so bad that I could truly care less who's featured in this game. The roster consists of- The Hardy Boys, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone cold steve austin, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane and a few others. There are about 40 some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables. But the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the NWO in it and is such a crappy game. I can't stress it any more how much you should stay away from this game. Bad controls, collision detection problems, bad graphics, limited engine, and so many more screwups makes this title only worth owning if you intend on buying the entire series of wrestling games like myself. If you're a collector, get it, if not avoid this one. It's literally the worst wrestling game of the 6th gen and possibly ever ranking alongside such failures like WCW Nitro, WCW thunder and the abysmal WCW BACKSTAGE Assault.WCW Vs. The World for the N64 is a helluva lot better than this game in every way and that's a wrestling game that's 4 years away from being 20 years old. Terrible.\n",
      "The year is 2002. President bush is plaining an invasion on Iraq because of threats of Nuclear weapons, America is entertained with American Idol. And the WWE just celebrated another Wrestlemania. In 2002 thq came out with this wrestling game. When I saw it I thought it was going to be one of the best wrestling games. But I was wrong. The controls are easy. But the game is bad. If your stone cold and you nail the stunner they get up right away. Just like on smackdown you can pop a finisher anytime. The Music is bad. And the story mode is god awful. If your champion you don't come out with the belt. My friends don't get Smackdown (err) I mean Wrestlemania X8 Get Day of reckoning. This game is very bad and should have never been created. Shame on you THQ For this game. Shame Shame Shame\n",
      "I've bought many wrestling titles by THQ for the nintendo and have found them all to be great.  When this game came out for the GameCube I was excited.  Excitement quickly turned into disapointment.  Everything that was great about the previous THQ wrestling games is missing in this.  The controls are sub-par and the graphics in my opinion are not as good as the 64's.  The computer AI is annoyingly cheap, reversing your best moves when you are at full momentum.  Bascially this is a rental and not a good rental at that.  Hopefully they'll be able to improve this title in later installments.\n",
      "Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting.Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better &quot;selling&quot; of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the &quot;sell time,&quot;  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry.The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.  What is there of No Mercy in this game,  as we were promised?  Not much.  Attacks to the groin give a &quot;ding&quot; sound,  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of No Mercy.  However,  whereas there were dozens of possible counters,  including varied reversals for heavyweights,  light heavyweights,  an martial artists,  there is usually only one reversal to a move,  and most are shared among many,  many moves.  Finishers can be reversed,  however.Among the good are a wide variety of matches,  every sort of match your little heart could desire,  provided it makes a showing on WWF/E TV.  HEll in a Cell,  Cage,  Tornado Tag,  etc.To summarize the gameplay,  it plays like a cheesy arcade game.  In the early nineties,  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason.  It's return is unwelcome,  and its demise will not be mourned.Create a Wreslter:  Sadly,  the CAW works like the Smackdown series,  without the benefit of all the options.  Selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites.  The CAW system from Smackdowns 2 and 3 was a huge selling point,  even to people disappointed with the gameplay.  This is but a pale imitation of better systems.Wrestlemania X8 has remained a fairly big disappointment.  Some will enjoy this title,  but I'd suggest renting it,  even if you are a fan of the Smackdown series and this review has done nothing to sway you.\n",
      "This game is frustrating. Each level or scene, has about 10 stunts to do. in the VERY first scene, u have to go FULL speed and do a 180. First, you have to have the right car or you will end up failing the mission. If you go a couple of mph less than the full speed of the car than you wont jump high enough and the director wont like it. Also, I found myself doing VERY close to a 180 but it didnt count cuase i missed by a couple of degrees. THE COMMERCIAL OVERRATES THIS GAME!!\n",
      "... Although it has cool graphics, the game play stinks, and the controls are too much hard-to-handle!!!! ...\n",
      "Pros:Car handling is easy and responsiveCons:Lack of walk-throughs adds a needless level of difficulty to an already challenging gameThere are reload screens between each takeI would have probably rated it 2 stars but the fact that Grand Auto Theft 3 is out there I gave it a 1.  Go to Grand Auto THeft 3.  You won't regret it.\n",
      "This game is super bad. It is difficult and very frustrating. Unlike some games where the challenge is figuring out the puzzle, this game makes you repeat and repeat the same move over and over. The load times are very long and very frequent. I'm sure if you spent years you could get good at it. In my opinion, a game has to be a little fun at first or who else but a masochist will want to play it.This game literally made me furious. To be fair, driving games usually aren't my cup of tea, but this game is a real turd. The graphics are good, not great, but solid. The only good thing about this game is that I rented it.If you like extremely hard driving games that take months to master, then this is right up your alley. If you like games that are fun and that you can play the first night without getting very angry, then stay away from this game.I hated it, I'm going to rent Way of the Samuri again, that is an awesome game.\n",
      "This game is terrible. Let's start it here.You're a stuntman. You get to follow orders from a director who demands you do some of the most stupidly rigorous tasks to complete stunts. Some of the stunts are cool, but the game gets hard at about the 4th level. The first movie you shoot is like a tutorial. I rented this game, and never beat it. The first level of the first real movie in which your basically like dukes of hazards is tremendously hard. You have to do things in split seconds, and the game is so hard that it is frustrating. The game has no good points that I can think of. On one of the first missions I didn't barrel roll and I still won it. Another time I was suppose to hit a  board and spin sideways near a garbage can, I barely did it and I won.But once you get to the dukes of hazards type movie, no. It's ridiculously stupid. There are cooling towers in random places falling on your car. Then you have to jump through a train at the start which is kinda luck. Anyways, the game could of gotten things right. For one, the game is fun when your not all stuntman. Right after you jump over a house, you get to cruise for like 30 seconds, which is fun considering the environment looks good. The game though doesn't lay out maps for you and doesn't give you any help. The director almost wants to make this thing as hard as possible because he never edits the movies(like normal directors and stunt coordinators do) and he never attempts to tell you where to go beforehand. You will be flipping left and right going up and down with no sence of direction. One second costs you the match...The game is terrible. There are some extras. Trailers or some crap. The map editor is terrible. You can put about 5 items in and that is it. I never figured out mechanical cars(I just decided to use cheats to unlock the editor stuff) and I never found out if there were any extra maps to unlock in the campaign. But this game offers nothing except frustration and crap. Honestly, I would like to see the creators beat their own game. If they could do that it would be great, beacause not many people can.\n",
      "Yeah, we've all seen the commerical, \"while all those pretty little actors are sitting in their trailers, being pampered, and fond over, the stuntmen are out having all the frickin' fun\". Just that line makes you want to go over to Circuit City and buy this game. STOP! DO NOT DO THAT! This game is a horrible waist. Truly an awesome video game idea, but it could've been brought to life on a totally different approach.The first level starts off with a few simple tasks. Or so they seem. You complete the first task, \"hey, no problem, I've got this nailed\", then, almost immediatly, the director shouts out another task you have to do usaully within 5-10 seconds. Despite how terribly hard, annoying, and frustrating it is, I just have to wonder how the makers thought this would be fun? I mean, completing task after task after task. Now, in games like Grand Theft Auto, the whole task thing's fun. You can actully get out the car and do other things, but not in this game! You are strictly stuck onto one direct path for each level, and there is no time for rest. As I said before, all it is is do this, do that, do this, you failed, do it again, time up, restart level, do this, do that, do this, do that, do this, you failed, start over...\".Please, spare yourself and rent it first. My friend and I both rented it and didn't even want to play it more than once. The first time we played was for about 2 hours (2 hours I could have been sleeping), and in that whole time, we did not even pass the first level. Now, to end this review, I'll be as frank as possibly: this game [is a mediocre piece of gaming].\n",
      "I saw the commercials for this game and the game looked awesome. Until I bought it. I played it over and over again trying to just get past my first stunt. Some stunts are easy but if you go 1MPH too fast or 1MPH too slow or cut a corner too widely or not wide enough the blood vessels begin to burst from the frustration. Believe me, the only cool part about this game is the commercials.\n",
      "If you like DragonBall Z the show, and you bought this game, you would know exactly why i think this. EVERY single thing in it is off course to the show. The very first things you fight are wolves, but for some reason, they made it so the wolves can kill you in 2-3 shots when you have to punch them 50 times to kill one. Also, when you fight Radits, piccolo says \"lets do this already\" he dosen't do one thing to help you. He just sits there watching.Another dumb thing about the game is that you have to do little side missions such as saving a boy in the forest. When Goku is going to fight Napa and Vegeta in the episodes, do you see goku helping people getting a toy boat or saving little boys in the forest. I THOUGHT NOT!The Game is very short and easy too. You can go to a level of 25. There is one challenging thing in the game and you will find that out on your own.This is the worst game ever. DO NOT BY IT!. It will make you hate Dragon Ball Z.\n",
      "&quot;This isn't so bad... Is that a rabbit? I think it might be a squirrel actually... ITS EATING MY FLESH! IM DEAD! SPECTACULAR!&quot; That's basically a short summary of this game. Talk about boring. You can die to the harmless butterflys if they touch you. Honestly, this game is terrible. To beat monsters you have to take damage or use up all your kai. To beat bosses you have to do some crappy solar flare 50 million times, hit them with 6 punches max, then run and do it over again.\n",
      "On the positive side, this game is seriously beautiful. Just looking at the environments kept me playing when the gameplay didn't. But the control system--terrible. The way the world whips around constantly at the slightest mouse movement made me want to throw up. You'd think you could fix this tendency by altering the mouse sensitiviy, but you'd be wrong. At the lowest setting BO2 still resembles the jerky camera parts of Saving Private Ryan--and I mean that in a bad, unexciting way. Also, what's up with no strafe controls? You can't bind any keys to move your player sideways. When you get in a fight the keys that previously and redundantly (since the mouse does that already) rotated the character are mysteriously transformed into the missing strafe keys. Why Eidos would abandon the tried-and-true Quake-type controls in this game is a mystery. I suspect it's an artifact left over from BO2's console port. With its whacky control system, the hardest part about BO2 is keeping your lunch down.Also, parents should take note of the \"Mature\" rating for this game. If ever a game deserved an \"M\" rating (or worse), this one does. This is coming from someone who's enjoyed other \"M\" rated games like Soldier of Fortune which features gory, war-type violence directed at armed soldiers (with a penalty for killing civilians). But Blood Omen 2 takes violence in a very dark direction. As a vampire you're encouraged to view humans as food and feed on them wherever you find them. In practical terms, this includes walking up to old ladies and clubbing them to death as they scream for you to stop. They fall down and try to crawl away while begging for their life and you have to beat them to death before you drink their blood (necessary to refill your health meter). While I generally view \"kills\" in video games as cartoonishly entertaining, I found this level of violence disturbing. I suppose it's passed off as \"natural\" vampire behavior (though I wonder about the public response if these were, say, Harp seals being clubbed instead of people). Everyone's got their own standard regarding game violence. Mine's pretty liberal, but this is the first game that made me feel like I'd seriously signed up with the Dark Side. The Mature rating means someone out there thinks it's suitable for your 17-year old son. I suggest you make that call yourself.\n",
      "It is bad...  The graphics are poor the game is lacking in so many ways.  Story does not mesh with the Soul Reaver series (which is worth buying).  It was dull and boring... I can not stress how bad it is.  Save your money.\n",
      "I bought this game when it was new, it's very fun and has good graphics for when it came out but it will NOT work on newer computers no matter what you try - Windows 95/98 Compatibility mode doesn't work. 640x480 resolution doesn't work. 256 color doesn't work. Do NOT buy this game if you have a computer built after 2002.Get the Nintendo 64 version if you really want to play, or write to LucasArts asking them to release it on Wii's Virtual Console if you don't own a Nintendo 64.\n",
      "Words cannot express how much I hate this game. There are very few games that I flat out HATE, but this is one of them. This could actually be the worst game I've ever played, so that's saying alot.The game tries to be a \"choose your own adventure\" samurai story set in the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate era of Japan, but completely fails. Here's why:-Even though there are multiple paths you can take through the game, you can beat the game in about 45 min. either way. Not even most 16-bit games are that short, and those are certainly a helluva lot more fun!-The swordfighting is boring, due to the slow pace, lack of moves, and under-evolved fighting engine. And since that's the main gameplay hook, it leaves you with little reason to play. Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry both sweep the floor with this one.-There's no voice acting. Just grunting and giggling sound effects. For a game that wants to have a story, this sure is a raw deal...-The save system is just messed up. Period. There were occasions where I'd save my game, die, and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased. And a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me I'm not alone on this one...-The black guy with the afro. Seriously, what the hell is this guy doing here? Maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while, it'd be pretty neat, but as it is, he has no personality, and seems to just take up space. Leave him alone.-The game world is tiny. It consists of 9 (I think) areas, that are each about the size of a football field. For a game that wants to have adventure game elements, this totally destroys everything, and is the final nail in this game's coffin.\n",
      "Here's my Haiku:Great IdeaOriginal and UniqueVery Badly DoneI rented this game with no instructions.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a tutorial.  This tutorial was slow torture, but I learned some things.  Then I started the game.  The Graphics were pretty good, and I sensed that some great stuff was going to happen.  I started off nicely, explored around, and I got killed.  So I started again, explored some other parts, and got killed again.  This time I decided to avoid getting killed.That's when this game got dull.  Really, really dull.  I played for two hours, painfully walking from one place to another.  The fighting, though interesting at first, was monotonous.  The setting soon became boring.  Worst of all, I wanted to save.  For the love of Goodness I kind not find out how to save.  The controls and tutorials taught me everything else but how to do.  After playing for three hours straight, I turned off my PS2, hoping the game was saved automatically.  It wasn't, and I wasn't going to repeat those three hours of gameplay, so I said forget it.I promptly returned it to the video store, hoping that the few hours that the game resided in my house didn't lower my property value.  This game was cheap.  First of all, there were no voices at all.  Voice actors are not expensive, yet they couldn't even afford that.  Secondly, there is no compass.  Many times I would want to go north, but I could only hope I was walking there.  I could only check when I reached a new area whether I went north, south, east or west.  Finally, you can not save immediately.  Granted, I could have looked it up how to do it on the internet, but by that time I realized this game wasn't even worth it.It's a great idea, terrible execution.  Avoid this game at all costs.\n",
      "I just knocked my keyboard drawer off the runners and smashed the CD into little pieces... Is that any idea of how I feel about this game??? It has great graphics, but the controls are like that of Indiana Jones; Emperor's Tomb, meaning absolutely terrible!!! Many times, I couldn't get the character to stop or to jump when I hit the buttons! And, like Indy, no saves on tough spots. You have to start all over again from the very beginning!!! Jesus, don't game designers EVER listen to gamers??!!! Fortunately, I only paid $5 for this game. Busting the CD into little pieces WAS gratifying... God, I hate it when designers come up with shoddy games like this! DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!! REALLY!!!The only thing positive I can say about it is the graphics. They're terrific, but it doesn't do you any good if you can't control the character! I even downloaded a patch, hoping that would correct the problems, but no good. Honestly, it's more aggravating than the money you waste on it. Absolutely terrible, dirty, stinking rotten ##@%+%&##!!!!!!\n",
      "I would rate it zero stars, but there is no such option.  Just as you are about to conquer the world, almost every single provence revolts.  Even if you have two spies in every provence.  Any loyalty of above 150.  Even if the enemy king is 78 years old, and all of his fellow horse men have been killed, he can rout 240 archers that have him surrounded, then kill your 30 something year old king and his three fellow knights.  The game has internal logic but it stacks the odds against you in ways that are oddly illogical.  It is just a frustrating game.\n",

      "The worst FPS available for the GBA is Wolfenstein 3D.  It's not the worst by much, Medal of Honor; Underground is pretty darn close.  Wolfenstein 3D was the fifth FPS for the GBA but the first FPS ever to be released for any system.  Bringing this title back from the dead probably wasn't such a good idea with games like Ecks Vs. Sever competeing with it.  Doom and Duke Nukem were old games coming back to life on the GBA but those turned out so darn good.  Those games featured beautiful graphics.  Wolfenstein 3D's are just plain outdated and ugly, however not as ugly as Medal of Honor: Underground's.  The game features the original 60 levels and 4 weapons.  Only 4?  Yes, I know, there were only 4 in the original but that is to little.  This game is even outdated on the Game Boy.  The game is still fun but there are a lot of better choices in the FPS genre for GBA.  Trust me.\n",

      "That's right.  If you found this controller more comfortable, you have little girly hands (obviously not an insult to female gamers out there).  I never saw anything wrong with the original controller, and still laugh at all who own one of these 'controller S's because they can't handle a 3lb controller that fits adult hands well.Don't get me started on PS2 and GC controllers (a camera button??), but I think the Xbox was innovative in designing a controller for someone with hands bigger and stronger than a 5 year old's.  They're durable, too.  I threw mine out a second floor window onto concrete (I don't take losing well) and it has barely a scratch.  I accidentally broke my friend's PS2 controller by just shifting it in my hands wrong (ultimately not my fault, for my hands were much stronger and versed to useing a tough controller).So, while technically this controller does the exact same functions as the original, I couldn't see myself wielding one anytime soon.  Cheers to those who whined until Xbox put this out.  I only wished you whined for something that really mattered, like more RPGs or less Sports titles.\n",
      "I purchased this Xbox Controller S used. The description by the seller was condition near new. However the way the controller's wires were wrapped suggested otherwise and the controller only lasted 2 weeks before shorts and freezes began during game play. But for $12 bucks, there is not much to complain about. I still have one of the original Xbox controller S from the 1st launch and it still works flawless. Oh well time to pony up for a 3rd party controller.\n",
      "We only gave this one star because that is as low as we could go. If we could go any lower we would give it a -5 stars. Do not waste your money or time on this game. It [stinks].\n",
      "This game should be called IGC: &quot;I'm Going Crazy&quot;.This game is'nt hard for any legitimate reasons. Anyone can build a budget game that has a buggy save system, the main character's aim is so bad it seems like he just stopped drinking the day before the first mission started and enemies that can cut you down with a pistol from orbit. But this is supposed to a high quality game! Buy Soldier of Fortune, Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon instead.\n",
      "this has to be  by far the worst gamecube game ever made\n",
      "I bought this game a few years ago for the SNES after playing BOF1.  I was looking for more of that wonderful gameplay in the first classsic game.  I was terribly disappointed and I endorse the comments of the other reviewer from Valencia, CA USA.  I quote them immediately below.*******************\"The sequel to one of the best rpg games with the best story line is a total and complete flop. breath of fire 2 does not follow anything even remotly like a story and is not in any way realated to the first game.the game should have had some thing to do with defeating Tyr after she comes back at the end of Breath of Fire 1. the fighting is different and when i tried to select a enemy to fight out of 3 enemies, i ended up shooting myself. what is probably the worst part about fighting is when you meet a new enemy. you can't see how much health they have so it is frustarating not knowing how long until you kill them. the graphics are horrible and are worse than any game i have ever played. the hunting in this game is extremly disipointing and you spend the time waiting for a deer or boar to come out of the grass. if you are looking for a good RPG, play Breath of Fire 1 or Golden Sun\"*********************Additionally, the storyline (what there is of it) is horrid.  It is not even a true sequel, but seems to be an attempt by the company to simply capitalise on the success of the first without too much effort.  In short people.  Do NOT buy this game.\n",
      "I see why other people like this game but it's not the type of game for me.  I think I decided to buy it because I was so amazed that they made a remake of 3D game.  When i was 7 or 8 i bought the first resident evil used at a rental store.  I thought you would battle zombies in a enclosed area.  I was terrified the first time i played.  I remember when jill's freind shoots off the zombie's head.  Maby the zombies should die this way.  This is one of the parts where the game is stupid.  In the new game a zombie backs you into a corner.  So what does you charachter deside to do?  Fall down and trip.  That was a great idea!! Lets do it again and again and again.  Maybe house of the dead is more my type.  In RE is you try to turn around and run away and when the zombie finally gets near you you have to turn around as slow as a blind cow with a broken leg on sleeping pills whose drunk.\n",
      "I am a total hardcore action/adventure/RPG fan, and thats what this falls into.  I'll play almost any game, and mostly like it, but this game disappoints].  The graphics are really nasty, seriously, they are really cartoony.  The voice acting is soo bad, and there are plenty of glitches in what he says.  The storyline is...what is the storyline?  You're not an important character at all.  The gameplay is the only somewhat good part.  It's just really [bad] that you throw your weapon around.  You can go into hand to hand too.  If you dont have 4 controllers this game is even more stupid.  If you are an RPG gamer, or like action/adventure, this game is NOT what you think.  If you liked all the gauntlet games, this is for you.  But I think this game [DISAPPOINTS]...\n",
      "This game ... It says it is 1-4 players simultaneosly, but it isnt. It is only 2... so it ... if you have friends and want to play. Either that or my multi taps b, c and d ports are messed up. Also the single player is too linear. You can barely explore or anything. The graphics are ok, but the sound effects ARE VERY BAD!! Everything sounds so cheap and inhuman. I rented this at blockbuster, I hope the game is messed up or something because it stinks. Turok 2 was alot better. I think gaming companies are all about graphics now and not gameplay; which is really sad. Some where I read that this game was going to be awesome, I totally disapprove. All the reviews I read anyways only talk about \"what they heard and saw\" Do not rent this game!! Wait for armored core 3.\n",
      "I've played enough first person shooters to know that this one wasn't worth the time or money I spent on it. Graphics are so-so. Level designs aren't much better. The game play seems to drag and skip whenever the action heats up. At first, I thought the flight sim sequences were a novel idea, but the moment things started to get exciting, the game paused to load the next section which totally broke the game rhythm. Switching weapons also happens to be sluggish, making combat sequences far more difficult than they should be.  Considering the quality of most games Acclaim puts out, this one was a major disappointment. If you're in the mood for an entertaining FPS, I would strongly suggest something like Deus Ex: The Conspiracy. The Medal of Honor and Red Faction series are also strong. I wish I could put a finger on what really irritated me about this game, but I can't--some games are a challenge while others are a chore to get through. Simply put, it's not fun.\n",
      "Like a lot of people I ran out and bought this much hyped game immediately, and like a lot of people I was sorely disappointed. This travesty ranges from the mediocre to the just plain bad. Most of the levels in this game are average at best and that's not including the horrible flight missions. The graphics are weak and the multiplayer is a freaking joke (on the PS2 anyway).Overall I'd probably give this game one and a half stars but I can't, and to tell you the truth it doesn't pain me that much to have to settle for one star.\n",
      "I love first person shooters, and when I saw some of the screen shots for the new Turok game I was excited.  I rented this game last weekend and I was thourghly disappointed.  First, the game takes forever and a day to load up, which I have never experienced before on a console.  Second, while the graphics are not bad, they are not a great use of the gaming systems capabilities.  As for the game play, well, it's horrible.  It takes one forever to get used to the controls and then the play is unispiring and boring.  The game goes from insanely difficult and times to just plain easy.  The AI is also sometimes too hard, then just too easy.  I did not like the flow of the game or it's style.  While I did not get to use the multiplayer function, I'm assuming it to not be bad, so this maybe a good rental, but if you are looking for a good first person shooter, don't get this.\n",
      "I should start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the first-person-shooter (FPS) genre. Unfortunately this game sorely fails to live up to any expectations. The game play is sluggish and unappealing. The graphics are sorely lacking, especially given the X-box's potential. The 3rd person flying mode is also uninteresting. Like the 1st person shooting mode, the flying mode has sluggish game control and boring graphics. Sadly, if you want a good FPS game, all you really have for X-box right now is Halo.\n",
      "The main reason for this game getting such a LOW RATING is because the control configuration is REALLY MESSED UP. You have to play with one of the two ways they give you which are basicly the same. And also the levels are easy to get lost on. IF you don't already have HALO buy it instead of this garbage.\n",
      "I love this game. The copy I got was terribly corrupt. It could not save after the second mission. I could not return it. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALER.\n",
      "I rented Turok Evolution ,And boy am I glad I did.It saved me money buying such a lousey game.The first chapter is ok but after that it goes down hill.They give you a scope for the gun that drifts and the enemy is already lobeing gernades and fireing at you befor you get there.then they give you only one way to go but your ememies can still sneak up behind you and surround you on all sides.you can never sneak up on the enemy they know your comming before you do.Do not buy do not even rent this it is a waste of your money and time\n",
      "Do not buy this game. Even though it is only 5 bucks on Amazon, and probably cheaper elsewhere the shipping wait is not worth it as you will put it down in the first hour or so. When i got it it was lame when all you do is shoot tiny little dinosaurs that could easily be stepped on. All the weopans suck and the only one i wanted was the nuke that you only get once(if you dont use it, it doesn't carry on  to the next level) I wanted to see the end of the game but i despised it too much to bother playing it so i used cheat codes, the end almost sucks as much as the game. Multiplayer blows and the controls are retarded.Save yourself the frustration of looking at it next to your xbox\n",
      "This game is just not that fun. I go in on hard and the game is still easy. On top of that, you have to fly in specified war zones. If you leave? Game over... Get a real flight game for like the computer because this game is stupid. On top of that, this game has some nice graphics, but that is only in the clouds. Everything else is way too boring. Another thing, the models on the planes are a little too big because sometimes you can hit your tail on the ground and not even really touch it.\n",
      "This game is sooooo bad the plane is slow and sooo un realistic the game its self is not realistic. The game is soooo Dumb and boring and hard sooooooooo hard. NOW FOR THE GOOD STUFF 36 different missions set over 3  distinct period of time. and master the navys top5 plans. and thats pretty much it.\n",
      "This game is terrible! you move way to slow, your attacks don't even kill beginning monsters, and the graphics look like a playstation one game.Don't even rent it it is terrible, but then again so were the other king's field games.\n",
      "While this game is a critically acclaimed RPG for its gameplay it fails to meet minimum graphics standards. This has to be one of the ugliest games I have ever played, despite the fact that 2002 (Neverwinter Nights, Morrowind, Arx Fatalis)was a strong year graphically for many great RPGs. Why settle for Icewind Dale II when you can get so much more for the same price?\n",
      "This game is just like Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel in that they both have absolutely no story and no real Role to Play.  If you like mass combat with no reasoning or brain hurting dialogue (in other words you use the phrase GROG SMASH! more than twice a day) you will love this game.  If you want storyline and such, might I direct you to Planescape Torment, Fallout, Fallout 2, or even (shrudder) Baldur's Gate 2 instead.  You'll thank me later.I can't believe Black Isle made such a motarded game...\n",
      "This game is GARBAGE. Avoid it at all cost. It's the biggest piece of @#$% I've ever had to play. and it's too bad because to the true MOH fan it would have been a nice take along but it's more of a leave behind.\n",
      "Medal of Honor: Underground is the eleven best (second to the worst) FPS for GBA and the ninth released for the system.  Medal of Honor: Underground looked promising for the GBA because the PS One version was so good.  When I turned on the game I thought it wasn't so bad.  Cut me some slack, I'm only reading the mission briefing!  After I was done reading, the game started.  What the heck am I looking at?  These graphics are horrible, some of the worst I've seen on GBA.  I liked how the other reviewer worded it, It was like sticking a turd in your Game Boy cartridge slot and flipping the on switch!  That's pretty much the only way I can describe how bad the graphics are!  After a while you get used to the chunky graphics and sluggish control and realize, okay, it's not that bad.  The game features a good story, neat cut-scenes and varied objectives.  This gives it more depth than the garden-variety shooter, ahem . . . Doom.  This is definitly one of the worst FPSs for the GBA.  Beware of the graphics!\n",
      "You think with games like doom and ecks vs server out they can make a decent fps for the gba, But nope not in this case. The single major flaw that ruins the game is the graphics. I mean i know its a gameboy and all but they are sooo bad, its like they tried making an fps on the NES. Walls dispear, patterns move making you dizzy. they enemys are just a blurr in the back ground. The objectives and idea are all pretty good but you can;t see anything t all. Try Doom\n",
      "The original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun. It was interesting, and I could play the demo for hours without becoming bored. The game remained interesting with cool characters, maps, and weapons. Then they released new maps, mods(relics in particular), and assault mode. That game was a success.Unreal Tournament 2003 changes the original into a lame game. There are all new guns, and worst of all... There are uninspired new maps. The new 2-fort is a sand like level that doesn't have the same feeling. The other maps just don't have anything to be talked about. The all new guns I mentioned? Crap. They all blow except the redeemer. The new sniper rifle(lighting gun!) is retarded. The new pistol is pretty stupid. There's also a gun now which instead of doing damage, it pushes the opponent. This is rather useless in pretty much any situation. If you are on the top of a tower it is good, but that is rare.Get the original Unreal Tournament or Unreal Tournament 2004. They both rock, and this game can just be skipped.\n",
      "I know there are a lot of NOLF fans out there but I didn't play NOLF 1, so I had no extreme expectations of this game. My computer is waaay beyond the recommended configuration, yet load times are about 20-30 seconds (which is unacceptable).I admit, graphics and sound are excellent but that's about it: the story is barely ok (with stupid story elements which are sometimes referred as &quot;funny&quot; - I think they sucked at best, some of them are downright offending (I'm not Russian but I know quite a few, I felt offended because of the idiotic jokes)).Missions are sooo boring, it's unbelievable (most missions are like &quot;kill everyone, get key, open door&quot;). Some levels are very tough and the randomly respawning enemies really pissed me off.One *VERY* frustrating thing was that this game is the only one to date (and to my knowledge) that crashes Windows XP so that you have to reboot it. Just this alone should mean the end of Sierra.If you're a hardcore NOLF fan, you might like this thing but I give 1 star out of 5, only for the nice graphics. I'll probably never buy a Sierra product again and certainly hope that they go out of business.\n",
      "There is way too much stuff to be picked up and sent all over the place for testing and researching and whatnot. Unfortunately, some witnesses are only \"unlocked\" after you submit the right item, so unless you're quite fast picking up stuff etc. you can't solve the case within the allotted time frame.This game would be very interesting and entertaining if they didn't cut off the investigation after a week (that's game time, not real time).\n",
      "The game itself is great, graphics, sounds, and concept is just like the TV show.  The major issue I have with it is the fact that it constanly locks up.  I'm running a PIII 733, 512mb Ram, 32 mb Video Card, 16 mb Sound card, and don't have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement.  Due to these technical issues I've encountered with the game, I have not been able to complete it.  It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case.  If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great.  The game is worth 1 star, even if there was an option for no stars, it still is worth 1 the 1 star I gave it.\n",
      "I've never revised a review before, but I felt I had to this time.  First off, do not think that the requirement listed on the package are all that's required for an enjoyable gaming experience here.  If you do not have one of the newer video cards, don't even bother.  Based on the requirements listed on the box, I should have been able to play this game without a problem.  But after dealing with a spinning screen, a game that paused for long stretches of time, and even a screen that went white, I called tech support only to find out (after buying the game) that I needed a newer video card if I really wanted to play.  Even after downloading and installing a few drivers provided by Legacy Interactive, I couldn't get it to run as it was supposed to.Then there is the trial section.  At least during the investigative half, you can pause the game or walk away from it for a while, and you have plenty of opportunities to save your game.  Save BEFORE you go to trial, and if you think you're going to be distracted DON'T go to trial.  Save your game, go live your life and come back to it later.  Because once you're in trial phase, you can't save or quit the game until that phase of the trial is over.  And again, if you don't have a newer video card, you'll be frustrated when you do get to trial because the 3D animation be jerky and will skip to such a degree that you will inevitably miss some of the testimony of the defense witnesses and some of the defense attorney's questions.  (And you can't object to what you don't hear.  Not effectively anyway.)I played through to the end of the trial phase, and all the way to the verdict just once, because I wanted finish at least one game.  And I then uninstalled the game and got rid of it.  If I want the \"Law and Order experience\" I'll catch the show itself on television.\n",
      "You play as a cop in this game. You can rob a car just like in Grand theft auto. The worst problem of this game is the graphic.It does not have many details.The car you're driving look almost the same as others on the street. They are all black or dark brown!Id rather play Maxpayne 2 or Burnout 3\n",
      "Hardest game I ever beat hands down!!! I still have nightmares about how much I HATE this game. The second I beat it I took the game out, slammed it into it's cover (of which I had thrown across the room several times along with the pile of controllers) and traded it in. Don't know why I stuck with it till the end. Just didn't want the game to beat me I guess. To this day have not been half as angry as when I played this god forsaken game. Hate hate hate HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "This Has to be the worst Max Payne Rip-off in History. Poor Graphics, Linear Story, & a Cheese-ball Character. Plus, The auto aim is annoying. There isn't anything awesome you're missing if you skip this game.\n",
      "This game has a great concept but the game play and controls really stink!  It's a 3rd person perspective shooter game with very poor camera views.  Most of the time you won't even know where the enemy is firing at you from.  To make things worse, the right thumbstick, which is used to control the camera view, is backwards, pressing right makes the camera go left and vise versa.  The graphics are definitely PS2 graphics, this game shouldn't have been released for the Xbox.  Overall, if you're looking for a great shooting/adventure game, I'd recommend Splinter Cell.\n",
      "Extra ExtraCorey Hart breaks out and becomes a cop with his sunglasses at night..,.,So the folks at Namco played Max Payne and thought,we can do better, so here it is!  I rented this at block busterand played it for about 4.2 minutes.  The controls are toocomplicated for a shooter.  I found myself once againputting in Halo to cleanse myself of that garbage.  Itmakes sense that nobody has rated this game becauseit is so bad it doesn't merit a review.  Why am I doing this you ask only to say I now have a stack of games but onlyHalo is worth the replay.\n",
      "Not much more to say except that this game wasn't worth the ten dollars I spent on it when I purchased it used.  Though there is somewhat of a story line, the game is boring.  It's one of those that you wished you had borrowed first before you purchased it.I think the only thing that this game would be useful for is to use the disc as a coaster on an end table.Bottom line:  F\n",
      "Well I've been searching for Chess games recently and I'm surprised that this version which is being released in September 2002 is not compatible with Windows XP!Yes look at the requirements: Windows 95 / 98 / Meor go to UBI Soft's website and indeed they are not supporting Windows XP for most of their games including this one. They say something about Windows XP having a new file type that is not compatible with their software.GRRRR I mean come on! I have a new tower PC and a new laptop both with Windows XP and I would love to have a nice Chess game available for it. UBI Soft get it right! Support Windows XP!Well I've love to play this game if I could. :(They only get a 1 star review from me until they support a Windows XP version.Stephanie\n",
      "Look out folks, despite there being no warning on &quot;some of&quot; the boxes (according to UbiSoft tech support), UbiSoft has brilliantly decided to prevent installation from a CDRW drive.  I have a Dell Inspiron 8500 that came standard with a Samsung CDRW/DVD drive, and I am unable to install.  Called tech support, and before I even got going, he knew exactly what I was talking about, and claimed there is no workaround for it.  I will simply have to return the game (even though I can't now that it's open) to the retailer and will not be able to play it until I buy a CD or DVD drive with no write/rewrite capacity just for this game.I don't know what genius at UbiSoft came up with this as a notion to prevent piracy, but I've got news for them, you're only hurting potential customers.  Blocking CDRW use on the disc itself isn't going to slow down some game cracker.  It's only going screw me up.So since there's no warning about this &quot;feature&quot; on Amazon, and as there's no warning about it on the box itself that I just today received from Amazon, I thought I'd come on here and let people know, lest they waste the purchase price as I did.These days, almost all laptops come standard with CDRW/DVD drives, why UbiSoft chose to cut off an entire slice of the market is beyond me.  Apparently this &quot;feature&quot; is now on all of their PC games.  So look out.I'm sure were I able to play it, it would deserve more than a single star.  But because I can't, and because I feel UbiSoft effectively duped me into buying by 'forgetting' the warning, I can't give it higher than that.  I'm not slamming the game itself, but rather their policy.\n",

      "This games title in region 4 (Australia/UK) is Crashed. I'm also reviewing the PS2 version, not the X-Box version, but Amazon has no listing for the PS2 version. Don't worry, both games are exactly the same from what I can tell... BAD.If you wanna play a great Demolition Derby smash up game, then look much further beyond this atrocious game. It's not so much the graphics or amount of different arenas you can play in, it comes down to the sloppy controls. It feels too tight to turn your car, and if you try a handbrake turn, you car does a stop skid turn, not a smooth follow through, anytime you hit the hand brake, you may as well have hit brake, as all it does is spin you in the opposite direction and bring you to a halt. You get useless nitrous that you don't even know if they are working or not half the time, just a spark from the muffler... and the collision damage is a joke, it's more like playing dodgem cars then getting the sense you are demolishing vehicles.If you wanna decent Demo Derby game, then go for \"Destruction Derby Arenas\" or \"Driving Emotion Type-S\", but for the love of hell, stay clear of this one.Graphics: 2/5Sound  : 2/5Controls: 2/5Replay V: 0/5Extras  : 0/5Overall : 1\n",
      "An ancient evil stirs; an impatient adventurer sets out from an insular village that has no other warriors (at least none that ever appear or help you) but is mysteriously well-equipped for training them. The story is the best part about this game after the graphics, but there's nothing here you haven't seen better before. Most of it is forgettable, but acceptable to get you from point A to point B provided the gameplay or graphics don't put you off.Story: 6/10The game went with a relatively painted sort of cell-shaded style, watching the scenes \"written into being\" as the game's equivalent of cinematics is mildly interesting but loses interest. Some people will automatically dislike the apparently cutesy graphics, others will be off-put by the limb-hewing and spurting blood. I didn't think they worked well together, but look up gameplay videos on Youtube to decide for yourself, this is one case where what you see is what you'll get and you may either like or dislike it.Graphics: 6/10There are some cries of anger, pain, and ambient noises that all seemed fitting. There weren't spectacular effects or voicing (more than a few of the lines are corny), but I thought that it fit the general tone and theme.Sound: 7/10The background music is rather bland, not especially annoying but a pale shadow of what video game music can be.Music: 5/10Gameplay is where this game really falls apart. Moving and trying to get the camera to cooperate was clunky and uncooperative. The combat felt rather awkward and unpolished, I had the distinct impression that it was rushed because there was a variety of \"combo attacks\", but none of them were really more effective than mashing the attack buttons and if you're fighting multiple opponents most moves won't be available anyway. Lack of effective smart targeting or good lock-on didn't help, and if you'd been mashing away at one enemy and they fell Rau was liable to continue hacking in that direction while three more soldiers bear down on him from other directions. I believe one word describes every stage of this game, including combat and \"platforming\": clunky.Gameplay: 3/10There are little rewards and minor easter eggs you can unlock by accomplishing sub-missions within areas, such as utilizing certain combos, but none of them really helped gameplay and nothing felt worth the time and hassle of going back.Replayability: 1/10For all of the \"our game is unique\" hoopla, I wish they would've spent some more time refining the play and areas. It looks like a cartoon, spurts blood like a survival horror, and will probably annoy you like a screaming baby. It definitely doesn't flow or captivate. Definitely rent before you buy, and if you can't try it first I would recommend seeking other games first, there's nothing here that isn't done better elsewhere.Overall: 4/10\n",
      "I cannot understand how any other reviewers on Amazon could give this game any better than 1 star. You see, I used to be of the mind that every video game, no matter how bad, had at least one redeeming quality. Sure, Tenchu was slow and poorly animated, but it had neat backgrounds and was it occasionally (unintentionally) hilarious. And on I Ninja, the \"beat the clock\" missions sucked, but the \"kill everyone\" missions more than made up for it. Then I played this game. There was nothing redeeming about it. Nothing.In fact, the only good thing about the game, an unlockable mode in which you fight solely against the game's bosses, mysterious disappeared shortly after I found it. The only other good thing about this game was the off button. (This was, of course, voted one of the top 3 worst games of all time on...some show.)But what was bad about the game? Well, your enemies suck. They range from brainless idiots to masters of the martial arts. And sometimes, they change from one to the other on a whim. They all look the same. All the ninjas have the same outfit; it just changes color (blue for boys, red for girls). And there is the witty banter they assault you with, which ranges from, \"Let's teach him a lesson,\" to \"I think I'm in love.\"Bruce himself is pretty messed up. When he's fighting, he sounds like a chicken. When he's not, he sounds nothing like Bruce Lee. He also has the extremely useless and life threatening ability to lock on to a specific enemy from a horde of many. This allows him to block that specific enemy, while all the rest of them sneak up behind him and kick his butt. Hard. By the way, the block button was X. X is not a block button. X is an attack button. They couldn't even get that right.I guess in an effort to show how much Bruce Lee looks like himself, the design team inflated his head a bit to make it stand out. That was kind of silly, but then again, so was the fact that Bruce changes his outfit every chance he gets. And not just from level to level. I mean when he starts chasing a ninja chick through pouring rain, he is wearing a Chinese style coat. But when he catches her he's shirtless. Then, the coat's back on. Where did he stick it, down his pants?I've got to admit, I never liked Bruce Lee. I thought Enter the Dragon was boring. So I hoped that this video game would allow me to look at Bruce with a whole new light. It did. I am now even less in Bruce Lee's corner.\n",
      "This game is a failure on every level.  From the very begginning cinematic sequences you can tell how little of the Xbox's capacity is being used.  The cinematics are worse than some I have seen on the original playstation.And the gameplay?  Ouch!  This game needed a few more months in development to work the bugs out.  Supposedly you can go through and earn new kung fu moves but who cares as you will have to perform them through bad graphics and severe drops in framerate any time there are more than 4 characters on the screen.  Think back to the old 8 bit nintendo games and you will get the idea.  I rented this game, fortunately, because I am a huge fan of Bruce Lee, and I really wanted to like it, but alas, IT Stinks!!!Those who have compared this game to Final Fight should write a letter of apology to the good folks at Capcom.  Final Fight is a much better game despite being 10 yrs older and having a fraction of the system resources available that QOD has.  At least Final Fight had a multiplayer mode and smooth graphics.Do not waste your money on this game!\n",
      "This game has bad everything.  Bad setup (aka you can beat bosses with your eyes closed.)  Bad graphics.  Bad Consistancy (With gameplay and graphics.)  All of that together = a game that is not worth buying.  I am very disapointing, thinking this would actually be good and it amuses me to think I once thought it would be good.\n",
      "\"Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon\" is a horrific game, that is even worse than many old 2D street fighting games like the \"Bare Knuckle\" series. There is probably only handful of combos you can pull off, and they all [stink]. Also, the voice acting and overall audio in the game is terrible; for example, one of the mini-bosses that one will encounter in the game, will say: \"You are dead\" in such a monotone manner that you probably will die in your seat from disgust. Taunting like that happens throughout the whole game, which is possible to beat in as little as 5 short hours. Additionally, the game's visuals are horrible too, even though there are some Xbox-specific graphical features, the game runs extremely choppy. The biggest problem is the loading time, which adds up to the choppiness and makes it even worse. First, when the level is picked, it will take like a minute or even more to load. Then, there will be loads after every time the player advances to a new scene in the same level. And finally, there will be yet another load when the player quits to the main menu.Thank God, that I did not buy this game. I hope nobody else does so either. All I can say, if you don't believe me on how bad it is, rent it, and I am sure you will understand and bring it back on the very next day...\n",
      "There are so many things about this game that make it stupid.  Luckily, I only rented it (and returned it the same night *lol*).  I feel sorry for anyone who had to buy it.  This has got to be the most disapointing game ever for the mighty XBOX.  Here's why:1. The gameplay: it's just uninteresting!  You walk around as Bruce Lee from a side view, A SIDE VIEW.  You kill people with 2 lame moves (punch and kick) and collect the coins that come after they die.  It's so lame and dull, it's LAUGHABLE!  It's way to easy, and beating up the people is so dull.  2 lame moves, and all the bad guys look the same.  You advance and keep collecting coins.  An ametuer gamer could beat this in 1 night!...2. The graphics = horrible!  Oh my goodness, Bruce Lee looks like a girl in tights (which is such an insult to his memory) and all the villains look exactly the same (red ninjas).  Oh, and the coins that you get our the size of Bruce's head.  The 2 lame moves don't even look real either.  I played this game ad beat 3 levels in 10 minutes.  I basily fell asleep in my chair.  When I woke up, I returned it immediatly!3. The reputation it tried to take.  I mean, come on: Bruce Lee.  What kind of people created this game; to insult his memory; this game is HORRIBLE!  On the cover, it even went as far as to say it was BETTER than DOA3!  I own DOA3, and it is a hundred million times better than this junk.I hope I've proved to you why u shouldn't buy this game.  It is so... easy to beat and so boring at that.  I'd rather watch grass grow.  There are so many better games to buy for it's price:... If it was about 5 bucks, I might counsider buying it.  But for everything else I can get for that price, I guess I'll have to pass...*lol*\n",
      "Grafix, on the x-box, mediocre.Story, bland and pointless.Controlls, slow and difficult.Action and play, abysmal terrible boring.Challenge level, not possible without cheating.Results: Shame on whoever disgraced Bruce Leewith this stinker of the year!\n",
      "PEOPLE ARE NUTS THIS GAME SUCKED!!! WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!  THE GRAPHICS WERE TERRIBLE, THE CHARCTERS INTERACTION IS BEYOND STUPID! AND THE CHARCTERS THEM SELF ARE JUST PURE JUNK!  THIS WAS BY FAR THE CRAPPIEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!! AND I PLAY A LOT OF GAMES.  SORRY PEOPLE BUT THIS IS JUST SPACE JUNK! NO GEM'S HERE JUST BARGAIN BARN TRASH!  (PASS IT BY)!!! AND RUN LIKE HELL!!!!\n",
      "How can this game be any fun at all if the disc keeps locking up on you halfway through the story?Sorry, but my PS2 is working perfectly.\n",
      "Ok, first of all I never finished the game, but that is because it is so frustrating and boring to the point where you can't possibly finish it without having dreadful thoughts of putting a gun in your mouth. Actually, the thoughts I had of putting a gun in my mouth were much more entertaining than this piece of shiz. I mean seriously, at least if I put a gun in my mouth I get to have complete control of the gun and where the bullet ends up. The latter statement brings me to my main point, and that point being, if I can't control the aiming process of my gun then what am I actually doing? Why do the gaming companies feel like they have to cater to people by implementing a lock on aiming system rather than a manual one. It completely takes the fun out of the entire experience. Whats truly amazing about this game is the fact that even with automatic aim implemented it's still a freaking hard game! So lets backtrack, the game is boring, frustrating, and flat out stupid!\n",
      "i loved onimusha. i hated onimusha 2. an utter waste of time and money, and i bought it for only 9.99. when i got to the final boss battle, i couldn't help but think 'this is it?' then i tried beating nobunaga a half dozen times or so, but couldnt since i used all my healing items and magic replenishers going into the purple phantom realm. if i had known that the final boss was right after i would have skipped it and whipped him good. so i finished the purple phantom realm and was hurt irreparably and only got some dinky sword. what a tur%. since i completed the whole game on normal i wasn't about to drop to easy mode just to beat the last boss. so i tossed the cd-rom in the garbage, something i had thought about doing quite a few times before as the game never started, and never really got going. a game without a soul. but there were a couple of pretty places with some nice graphics, that is the only positive.avoid\n",
      "I have played many ps 2 games and this is bad. I can't use the analog stick to move. I have to use the pad. When I use the game pad.. I still can't move in the direction I want to go. Up is not up, more like moving back wards. There is no option to change to the controller stick. Yea, the graphics are great but that is all I will say for this game. I will return back to game stop. I would rate this video game a big 0 if I could. And I love fighting games.\n",
      "First of all,I didn't even want to rent this game cause I thought it looked stupid and insulted everything that was great about final fantasy.I SHOULD have listened to my first instincts,but instead I gave into to so many whining squaresoft&quot;fans&quot; who said that this really is a great game,you just have to get past the fact that there's disney.HA! I'd like to know how that is possible when everywhere you turn,disney is screamed in your face;the shield has a mickey mouse emblem on it,the sword has a mickey mouse emblem on it,everything has a mickey mouse emblem on it!What really bothered me the most about this game was all the subliminal messages in it.For example one of the final fantasy characters in the final fantasy world says&quot;Our world is just one tiny peice that is part of something much greater!&quot;OH!I see,so final fantasy is just something insignificant and what's sooo much greater is disney!This also leads me to ask that if each individual disney story/movie had it's own world,then why couldn't they have done the same for each individual installment of final fantasy?Every final fantasy fan knows that the diffrent stories in the series where always on an epic level,so why does disney treat the final fantasy anthology so unimportantly?By just mixing all the final fantasy characters from diffrent games into one world to call it's own was a slap in squaresoft's face.And just look how they depicted poor cid from ff7!They gave him blonde hair(he's older and has grey hair)plus they got rid of his cigarette and put a twig in his mouth....grrrr!Of course I suppose disney was the right partner to choose for this project since squaresoft seems only to want to make interactive movies instead of games.By this,I mean the same problem with kingdom hearts was what I saw in final fantasy X; play a little bit then watch a cinema(which you can't skip over either),play a little bit more then watch another cinema!This replays itself over and over and gets extremely annoying.Graphicsseem to be more important than gameplay.Lastly kingdom hearts is not a true rpg to which it passes itselfover as on the box.It isn't a true rpg in the sense that there isno turn based battle system;it's an action rpg with free moving enemies and heroes.This tied in with the locking system makes it much more like zelda:ocarina of time than any of the final fantasy series.Why squaresoft chose to do this is a mystery to mesince the game is supposed to tie in with final fantasy.My only guess is that it was probabaly disney's idea,since they see fit to march right in and change every aspect about anything with THIS world!The saying for kingdom hearts is &quot;You'll never know who you'll run into next.&quot;I think the saying for disney should be&quot;You never know what we'll take over next!&quot;I'd rather eat a bucket full of broken glass than play this disney comercial!!\n",
      "I tried so hard to get into this game.  I love RPGs and especially the Final Fantasy series, along with dungeon crawlers (such as Dark Cloud and Zelda).  This game bored me so incredibly with its easy button pressing and redundant music whenever I was walking or fighting (the cutscene music is excellent).  The gameplay is seriously lacking in the FF strategy and Zelda variety, being a simplified version of a dungeon crawler.  This is not for RPG veterans.  It will offer them no challenge and just put them to sleep.  I recommend this to the younger gamers who have not played any (or many) RPGs.  If you are not a part of this crowd, steer clear.\n",
      "Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion.\n",
      "If you're by any means a seroius gamer, this is definitely a big waste of your time. I'm not quite sure whether it's rated \"M\" or \"T\", but it's a silly game, based on characters from other games and the whole thing doesn't make much sense.\n",
      "This game has a great idea behind it. Putting characters from two beloved franchises (Final Fantasy and Disney) into a brand-new storyline with a few new, original characters is a stroke of genius, and it works well. The environments are colorful and perfectly capture the fantasy vibe; the original PSone models of old FF characters are brought to the next-gen world with great graphics and superb voice-acting. The story itself is also interesting. So I happily leapt into this game, really excited about the whole thing.Then, something terrible happened: gameplay. Sora (the main character) moves so clunkily and imprecisely that both combat and exploration are a chore. If battles were turn-based in classic Square fashion, this would be easier to deal with, but they're not. They're done in real-time, meaning that you are never given a rest from the painful controls. No matter how fast I tapped the buttons or moved the control stick, Sora's attacks were always several steps behind my commands. And when I was platforming in the \"exploration\" segments, his pitiful jumps and tendency to keep moving once I released the analog stick was continually frustrating.All this wouldn't be so bad if the game was forgiving enough to accomodate the interface, but that isn't the case. Indeed, the difficulty is actually harder than many games I've played with better control schemes. Enemies are whip-quick and surround you in a flash; platforms are tiny and widely spaced; and replenishing items are always in short supply.Another complaint I have is that the puzzles don't make sense. Unlike better RPGs (Paper Mario 2, for example), where you can analyze the area and figure out what you're supposed to do, Kingdom Hearts gives you no clues. I would have been stumped within minutes if I didn't have the strategy guide to back me up. Like everything else in the game, the puzzles must be done perfectly, with no mistakes, or you have to start over. Seeing as you don't know if something is a mistake or not until you do it, this gets very tedious and frustrating.Overall, playing this game felt like trying to dismantle a ticking time bomb with no tools, where touching one wire could mean death: stressful, confusing, and definitely not fun. And after a while, it doesn't even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colors.\n",
      "I loved final fantasy 7. Final Fantasy 8 was pretty good. Then Final Fantasy 9 was the worst game ive ever played. 10 was pretty bad too. But now Square is doing something different. Kingdom Hearts is a way to make money off previous characters. I doubt anyone would buy this game if Final Fantasy characters were not in it.Lets be honest, its horrible. For once just admit Square made a bad game. The controls are the worst. Whenever you want to manipulate the camera, it goes spinning in the other direction. It took me like 3 hours just to beat this Alice in Wonderland level. And yes, it is a hack and slash game. All I do is hit X and the game locks into things and attacks. Pretty easy. There is no fun factor really.Cool old Square characters. I can see why they had to add those in. Without Cloud or Squall the game would have been thrown out by most. Now dont just say my review is horrible because you like the game. Most of the reveiwers have not even played it. The plot is probably one of the worst plots ever. You lock doors that seemingly hold the entire worlds existence, and you need to close them before they are opened by the bad people. So the bad people are looking for the 7 princesses to open the ultimate door. Wow that took real genius, not. I bet Square thought of this whole game in one day. ALSO, this is just like all the other final fantasys. Your best friend of member of your party turns on you. Kairi or whatever turns to hate you because he wants your girl. Some witch tells him to hate you because you hang out with donald and goofy, and Kairi is just like \"Yea, he should be hanging out with me. But I never want to be his friend again because he was so loyal to me!\". Its kinda stupid that we were best friends one minute, now he wants to slaughter me. Well I can tell you that hes just a sad Seifer rip off from FF8.Now before you go dissing my review, look at the facts I have given you. The only reason this games been gettin mad reviews is because 1)Square made it 2)Old final fantasy characters come back. Just before you go and play it let me warn you. It is NOT a final fantasy. IT IS A PLATFORM GAME. YOU WILL SPEND HOURS FALLING BECAUSE THE CAMERA AND CONTROLS. Now that I have given you this knowledge, do not give Square any more money.\n",
      "it's not really action rpg...this is more of a platform game which is why i hate it! you have to do alot of stupid jumps that are not easy to do because the platforms are ridiculously far apart. don't buy this game! frustrating, not fun at all! worst game ever!\n",
      "Oh boy squaresoft is on a role. They have been dishin out some sh*tty a*s games lately but this has to be the biggest piece of sh*t squaresoft has dispensed out of their behind. So lets take a look at the title first...A little fruity I know. Ok ok lets take it from the basics. I bought the game a year after it came out....Due to the huge hype about. You know all these little nerds sayin \"Man Kingdom Hearts is awesome!!\" or \"Man I couldn't take a crap without Kingdom Hearts\". Personally I dispiesed the game but you know what peer pressure does to you. Living here in Japan squaresoft was hailed as the greatest RPG maker ever which I can understand i.e. Mystic Quest (Personal Fav) Nevertheless with a name like Kingdom Hearts...Makes you question the game. Know in this day in age when to people use the word kingdom? I've never even heard the word empire used unless people were punning at the united states government. Anyways Kingdom makes you think of faries and nonsense...hence disney and their perverted godness. Hearts makes you think of a smelly old love story..Or a great classic card game!! So if the name doesnt drive you away lets see what does.Upon further dissection the game is simply compiled of a gay character who looks like a cheaply made version of all the Final Fantasy characters. Now for a lot of you readers maybe I should have told you this before but if you don't like Final Fantasy you might...I mean you won't like this game at all. The truth of the matter is, that this game is a fantasy of its own. A bunch of fantasy looking characters hanging out with the queers of Disney. How fun!! So the theme of the game is to search for your gay lover....Actually I never took the time to understand the point of the game though I believe it had to do with searching. Nevertheless the gay characters will pretty much make you want to go and buy Soul Reaver its that bad!! Squaresoft has outdone itself this time. Teaming up with disney must have been a sign of Squaresoft reaching rock bottom. Their time on deathrow was almost up but with Disney on their back nothing is to fear. So they made up some lame queerish characters and made a bad story and whipped it all together...hence \"Kindom Hearts\" How sad. When I remembered great classical games they took time and dedication...This game took a whole bunch of as*holes and just glued them together. The game is retarded as hell and I know for a fact that a 5 year old could throw up a better game then this.For your own saftey I would stay away from this game. Its cheap graphics, gameplay, music, characters....there are just so many aspects of this game that suck its so hard for me to tell you. But seriously if your that bored to buy this game sure do it. But you'll have 50X more fun buy breaking it with a hammer:)\n",
      "Okay, I'm a minority in this, but I hated this game.But before I rant and rave, the good parts. The controls were good, the graphics were nice and tidy, and the music was SO good.But the bad... Oh the bad. Quickly I found myself confused as to where to go. I could not work the \"Gummy Ship\" or travel to other levels easily. I was so confused... And the story itself is not appealing to me. I like Disney Films, or some of them anyway, but mixing Disney and Final Fantasy was DUMb-UH. It was like shoving two puzzle sets together and trying to make a picture with the mess... and you can't do that. Square peg doesn't go into triangle hole! And I hear that the sequels are doubly confusing!It was unpleasant for me. For others it may be a nostalgic joy ride with two great casts, Final Fantasy and Disney characters going side-by-side. I wanted to see the Winnie the Poo level and the Nightmare Before Christmas level, bud saddly I could not get it to work right, no matter who I talked to, what I did, how far I leveled up, or anything.\n",
      "this game is horrrrrrrrrrrrrrible. I have tried the demo and it is way to slow, basically just a complete copy of mech warrior. They shouldn't bother with this game, they should just stick to mech warrior.Trust me\n",
      "The game cheats!!!  When you keep burning the computer he just starts making your recievers drop balls.  That is about the lamest thing I have ever seen.  The developers just failed to make a good enough AI to stop your offense to the game just cheats, this is stupid, unrealistic, and completely unnerving.  And what is up with his 3rd down percentage?  Give me a break, I cannot tell how hard it is to stop the computer on 3rd down, it is almost impossible.  I have played a lot of football games in my life and I found NONE to be so unrealistic and infuriating as this one. I really liked the 2k2 version but this game is a piece of junk.\n",
      "When EQ2 came out I screamed horray!!!! But as I played it I felt let down, betrayed, scammed, etc. I switch over to WOW and I am having a good time, but graphics are toonish though.Do not waste your money!\n",
      "Im sure EQ2 will have plenty of pretty graphics, but the fact remains that SOE will still be the business behind the game, which means crappy support, lots of bugs, and many upgrades that you must pay for to support their company.I played EQ for 5 years, and will count myself out of this one.\n",
      "The general consensus amongst the MMORPG community would seem to be this: EverQuest II is yet another example of Sony's fanatical obsession with eye candy over content.There's little to no \"meat\" here... in fact, Sony's own online websites can't seem to provide any sort of storyline behind EverQuest II, other than it being set 400 years or so from the time of the original EverQuest, the moon of Luclin blew up, and now the entire huge, sprawling world of Norrath has been reduced to two measly starting cities, on one continent......sounds pretty cheesy to me. Wanna see another red flag..? The sheer size of the installation of this game positively SCREAMS that it's loaded with resource-sucking bells and whistles, which Sony is well-known for focusing on when their overall storyline and content are weak.Most veteran EverQuest players have watched Sony Online Entertainment completely RUIN the original EverQuest, ever since late 2002 when Sony bought out Verant (the originators of that once-classic MMORPG game). Given what we've all seen from SOE over the past few years (the destruction of EverQuest, the absurdly pointless Star Wars Galaxies, horrible customer service, and insultingly shameless greed), I see absoultely no reason whatsoever to believe that EverQuest II will be anything short of an overpriced, inane memory hog of a \"game\" that will ultimately leave the player feeling unsatisfied and cheated....\n",
      "like so many other people, i fell in love with everquest when it came out.  it was the first game to approach a complete virtual world in 3D with tens of thousands of other people interacting with each other in a fantasy setting.  however, i know that the great things about EQ, the real spark, came from the initial developers, all of whom have since left to join various other companies because of Sony.  In my 5 years playing EQ, i have only seen Sony make bad decision after bad decision, release 5 ( or is it now 7 .. 8??!!) money grubbing expansions and consistantly ignore their absurdly loyal customer base.  MMGs, even more than other games, require companies that pay attention and value their customer base, and also PLAY and LOVE these games themselves.  I can tell you without a doubt in my mind that EQII is going to be a disaster for Sony, and I hope it drives them into the ground.  Buy World of Warcraft instead.\n",
      "Ummm... no thanks. I don't care HOW pretty it is, I, as well as just about every EQ player I know (and I know many of them) all agree: The timesinks stop at EQ1. There will be no starting over for any reason. We've all invested too much time on EQ1 to just drop it and move forward, especially with Sony's infamously horrific customer service.I am a paying beta tester for Everquest (in my opinion that game still hasn't left beta, and since I pay to play it, well, that makes me a paid beta tester doesn't it hehe). I will not pay Sony for the privaledge of testing their new game.IF Sony was smart, they would make Everquest II a complete rewrite of EQ1 with this fabled new engine of theirs and allow people to import the characters into it that they have worked so incredibly hard on.EQ2 is going to be a total loser, mark my words--regardless of it's prettiness or features. It will be another Anarchy Online, UO2 (ummm WHAT UO2? heh), Dark Ages of Camelot, etc. It simply will never reach critical mass because EQ1 players will NOT switch in droves like they are hoping.Sony is crazy to make EQ2 incompatible with EQ1. Not smart at all.It truly seems that the \"soul\" of Verant has left the building, in a big way, since their acquisition.\n",
      "This game [is bad]. It is the worst game I have ever played. the point of the game is to shoot the choppy aliens with your green glowing balls before they shoot you with their red glowing balls of DEATH! Its a game that people should be executed over making. (or selling? :) )  So please for your sake DON'T BUY THIS GAME IT [IS BAD]!!!! Rent it first so you can agree with me.\n",
      "it was so fun i fell asleep. the grafiks was way better then my super nintendo. the peeple move better then the rok in my bak yard. the accent sounds like my brother wen he &quot;stoned&quot;. i recomend this to anyone who likes really bad games. kuz it was really, really bad\n",
      "O.K. When someone gives a game only 1 star - they can sometimes have an agenda.  My only agenda is to inform gamers how dissapointed I was at this game and let the gamer make-up his or her own mind.  I was very excited when I brought POW home and placed the disc in my XBOX.  The intro scene was well done and signalled that CODEMASTERS were capable programmers.  Then I played the game.  The graphics are seriously below par for an XBOX title.  The poor quality of graphics made it impossible for me to forget that I was staring at my 35\" SONY instead of having the impression I was back in 1942 in a German POW camp.  If I thought the graphics bad - imagine how I felt when I played the game.  The gameplay is absolutely awful.  MOVEMENT - think Halo for the LEFT THUMBSTICK (which is cool.)  However, for whatever reason, the RIGHT THUMBSTICK only allows you to look left or right - not up or down.  HOWEVER...the values are reversed - to LOOK LEFT requires that you PUSH RIGHT - and vice versa.  I know what your thinking because I thought the same thing - there has to be a menu that allows you to change the polarity of the RIGHT THUMBSTICK - NOPE!  With Halo I was effeciently killing bad guys in no time.  With POW I was taking my frustration out on the innocent XBOX controller within 10 minutes.  Oh, and it only gets worse.  To climb over 1 wall/fence requires you to stand facing the fence.  Then, press the LEFT THUMBSTICK forward and press the A button to jump and grasp the ledge (if a wall) or grab hold of the fence.  Next, press the LEFT THUMSTICK forward once more to climb to the top of the wall or as many times as needed to climb over the fence.  Next, the camera angle automatically swivles 180 degrees - to the other side of the wall/fence.  Now, you must press the LEFT THUMSTICK down once to grasp the ledge and again to drop to the other side.  You cannot imagine how clumbsy this feels.  In the early levels - when guards are not overly aggressive/smart - you can ignore this clumbsy requirement - but later you'll be quite frustrated.  If you press and hold the LEFT TRIGGER you are in FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE - meaning you can look side-to-side and up-and-down using the RIGHT THUMBSTICK - think Halo's RIGHT THUMBSTICK but without the ability to move when the LEFT TRIGGER is depressed.  Now, you've finally scaled a wall and you stealthily enter a building looking for currency and useful items.  Well, when inside buildings your point-of-view becomes fixed (from inexplicably some of the worst vantage places - without any room-level zooming capability) - and your RIGHT THUMBSTICK becomes useless - until you enter the previously mentioned FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE by pressing the LEFT TRIGGER.  Useful items/loot twinkle and all you have to do is walk next to the item for it to be placed in your inventory.  However, your instincts will be urging you to perform a thorough search of the room - open a few drawers - well they must not have had drawers in WWII because all you can do is walk around a static room.  So you do just that - but due diligence requires that you walk a few inches enter the FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE look around for goodies and then walk another few inches enter the FIRST PERSON VIEW ONLY MODE...etc.  You quickly discover that the only loot in the room is what twinkled upon entering - this must mean that Germans don't hide things - interesting?  The inventory management subsystem was poorly conceived.  Anything you cannot fit in your pockets is carried for all to see in your hands.  There are hiding places you can find scattered thoughout the camps and you have a personal footlocker in your barracks.  It took me forever just to figure out how to examine/use inventory items.  Game Saving - you must be in your barracks and next to your bed in order to save your game.  The game designers felt that one of the driving forces behind a prisoner of war game had to be the daily routine that a prisoner was forced to adhere by.  So they devised a lame gimmick - a timepiece - that helps you plan mischeif around static morning and evening roll calls.  So you are allowed to go exploring as long as you do not get caught in a guards vision-cone while in an illegal area as long as you get back to morning/evening roll call.  From the moment I began playing this game I was extremely dissapointed.  After playing for a day - I knew I was going to get rid of the game quickly before word got out.  The graphics are boring.  The character controls are the worst in XBOX history - why do I have to press right to look left - (that infuriates me)?  The idea of being a prisoner of war trying to escape is golden (and I hope someone pulls it off), but this implementation is shameful.  CODEMASTERS quality assurance team should be fired.\n",
      "I like stealth games and I figured this one was going to be good, I was wrong. Despite the graphics being kind of bad, I can sometimes look past that as long as the game play and controls are good. I saw this and read the back of the case and it seemed like it would be good so I got it from my local EB Games for $15 (glad I didn't pay $50 when it officially came out). Needless to say I played this for about 45 minutes, got bored and frustrated with it and took it out. I was worried after seeing the opening sequence (how typical, cheesy and the bad graphics) but when the actual gameplay came to be was even worse. This is one of the worse games I've played in awhile, definately avoid this one at all cost, I wouldn't even take it for free\n",
      "This is rediculessy hard. I can only see a video wisard beating this game.I bought it for 20 dollars at gamestop what a rip off\n",
      "i picked this up in a bargain bin at a local video games store. my mistake. there are good and even great star wars games (kotor, star wars galaxies pre-cu), and there are terrible star wars games (star wars galaxies post-cu). this is totally horrible and isn't worth picking up for 5 bucks.\n",
      "I'm sorry to say this, but this game is pathetic, and the level of fame that developer BioWare has gained over it really saddens me. Now, I'll admit that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan (read: I saw one movie when I was eight), but I am a huge RPG fan, and this game plummets far below my expectations. I will describe my experience with the game, and hopefully you will choose to pass it by and skip the agony I went through.At the start of the game, I was asked to choose my character's appearance, skill point allocation, and basic moveset. Sounds fun and cool, right? That's what I thought, too. Until I realized that every character model was blocky and pseudo-realistic (you know, that weird, pale, supposed-to-look-human-but-really-doesn't look), the skill-point system was convoluted and confusing to anyone who isn't a hardcore Dungeons and Dragons player, and choosing my moves was so difficult and frustrating that in the end, I didn't even know which ones I had. Creating the character took an hour, and I didn't feel at all satisfied after I finished.Once I started the actual game, things only got worse. I headed to my first battle, expecting a standard turn-based system at the least, and an innovative action/RPG blend at the most. I got neither. Instead, I was greeted a bizarre mess. In fact, this combat system was so strange and awkward that I don't think I could even describe it. All I know is that, first off, my character was somehow moving on its own, and second, the commands I entered didn't seem to effect what happened onscreen at all.After making my way through several battles, by way of random button mashing and liberal use of medpacks (that was the easiest way to do it, and seemed to have the same result as trying to concentrate and strategize), I met my first party member. What happened after that just plain scared me. First, the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream. Secondly, while the horrendous voice is grating your ears, you have to look at a disturbing close-up of the character's face as he's talking. And finally, THE FACE DOESN'T CHANGE. His expression stayed exactly the same throughout the entire conversation, and this happened with every single other character I talked to. Freaky.The final part of the game that I played through was the first city. It was big, with lots of people walking around, going about their lives. This would be cool, if I had known where to go in this massive maze. But did I? Nope. Although my horribly-voiced partner apparently knew the city well, I recieved no guidance from him. Instead, he followed me around, giving me no hints but the instruction to \"find Bastilla\". By the way, I knew nothing about what Bastilla looked like or where she might be.After twenty minutes of running around in the maze, talking to random, badly-voiced people, most of whom had mean things to say, I gave up. Maybe people who like Star Wars and D&D; will appreciate this, but I just can't. BioWare, quit pretending you're the next great RPG maker and go back to putting your characters in MTV music videos.\n",
      "The only reason I bought this game is because it had this so called \"game of the year\" thingy. You can't even attack, whats up with that. I'm a big boy, I can fight for myself I don't need the Xbox doing it for me. After an hour all I got done was making my stupid charater then I found out that you can't attack. Practicly the whole game is talking, talking, talking It's like The Social gathering game gone wrong. Do yourslef a favor and don't buy it. Its a total waste. Da** u Lucas arts.\n",
      "I picked this game up a few months back. I got it because I just got through with Mass Effect and loved that game. Well the folks who did Mass Effect for the most part also had a hand in making this Star Wars game, Knights of the Old Republic.I'll make this short, because I think some people need to know just how flipping boring this game is. The dialogue is okay. You have to read it, and there is no actual speach. I can live with that, especially since this game did come out a few years back.However, the action sequences are left the game found wanting. You press a button, and watch your characters do all the work. \"Wow. That's it?!\" Is what I thought to myself. I'm not much of an RPG guy, but when I hear the words \"ACTION\" and \"FUN TO PLAY\" associated with it, I tend to think their might be some challenging action scenes to go along with a game with story line. You know, something like Deus Ex, or Mass Effect. Heck, even the Final Fantasy guys get it right year after year. I say all of that, so I don't get people flaming me saying I just don't like RPGs. I do like RPGs, just the good ones.I felt like I was being spoon fed everything to continue on with the game. It wasn't challenging at all. I had to quit after playing this game for about an hour. I kept telling myself it will get better, and it never did.Sorry folks, but Star Wars games like the X-Wing/Tie Fighter series, Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, and even the Rebel Assault games were better than this crap.You want a good RPG from Bioware? Play Mass Effect. You want a good RPG period? Play Lost Odyssey, or Diablo, or Titan's Quest, or the Elder Scrolls series, or the Fallout series, or Final Fantasy. Just not this game.\n",
      "Did I miss something? I'm at a complete loss as to how this game has been receiving such rave reviews.  I agree with the other reviewer: the &quot;game&quot; consists of walking ten feet, meeting an NPC, then interviewing them with what seems like an endless (and mostly pointless) conversation.  Then you walk another ten feet, meet another character, and start all over again. Occasionally, you run into someone you have to attack, but the combat is so boring that it makes watching a bunch of senior citizens playing golf look like extreme sports. Simply hit &quot;yes&quot; when asked if you want to attack, and then just sit and watch, and hope your complete lack of participation somehow affects the outcome.  So join the excitement of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: Talk! Then, talk some more! Then, fight by pressing &quot;X&quot; (once). Then, talk yet again! Don't just do something, stand there!\n",
      "My neghibor is in 6th grade and he beat it in one night.  Does this tell you anything?\n",
      "Mace Griffin will probably be remembered as one of the greater disappointments for the PS2.  This was one of those titles that sounded promising in the development stages but never panned out even though its release was delayed for about a year.Where do I begin?  First, like others have warned...this game is HARD!  There is no difficulty selection so you have no choice but to try and tough it out.  The save system is AWFUL!  It's one of those games that only allows you to save at certain points.  That would be totally fine if those chosen points were logical.  They're not.  It's frustrating when you have 100 percent health and have been playing for half an hour...only to have some guy hit you in the head with a rocket and kill you.  Oops...guess you have to replay the last half hour again.  Sometimes, though, they let you walk through an area for only a few minutes with hardly any enemies and then the game gets to a save point again.  Dumb.The transition between ground fighting and air combat was highly touted.  It is a seamless transition but they left out that one important factor.  It's called FUN!  The flying parts of the game are even worse than in Air Force Delta Strike.  What about the ground fighting?  Well, I can't say it's bad because it's not.  The thing is...this had already been done plenty of times before  and it's been done much better.  You get your usual array of unoriginal weapons.  You get to shoot at tons of people and aliens.  You get to wander aimlessly through corridor after corridor.  Yawn.The graphics are average at best (this ain't no Splinter Cell) and there is unbelievably no multiplayer feature!  Too many exceptional games have come out over the past few years and our standards are a lot higher these days.  Unless you enjoy walking around shooting enemies with your machine gun level after level after level, then I sure wouldn't recommend you wasting any money at all on Mace Griffin.\n",
      "Let me tell you about my experience with this game:First level:  Dark.  You have to crawl through a lot of ventilation ducts, but you can't see the entrance to them even though you're standing right in front of them because it's so dark.  Other than that, the graphics have a very PS1 look to them, and the weapons were rather dull.  The weapon selection menu sucks, you have to cycle through all your weapons to get to the one you want.  Try doing that in the middle of combat with guys shooting at you.Second level:  Space combat sucks!  Your enemies fly around you like a swarm of bugs.  They're so much more maneuverable than you that you're lucky just to see one on your TV screen, much less get a weapon aimed at them.  The rest of the level is combat onboard a spaceship, it gets repetitive and boring.  You have to go an unbelievably long period of time between save points.  When you pass a checkpoint, the game may save automatically, or it may not.  You'll get a nice surprise next time you turn the game on!  You are given the option to quit and save, but not to save and continue playing.  Even if you do manually save it, it might not save anyway.Third level:  Frustrating.  The spiders really suck, they jump around and you can waste hundreds of rounds of ammo killing them.  They can kill you in a couple of seconds if you're not careful (and lucky).  Other enemies need to be shot 50 times to kill them - they can even survive a point-blank shot with your rocket launcher.  So I get to this one really long and rather difficult portion of the game, and after playing through it about 10 times, I finally get to the next part.  No save point.  I get killed by a spider that drops down behind me.  I swear at the TV.  I do it again, make it past the spiders, and what do I get?  I've go to jump from one place to another.  Miss the jump.  Run across the room, up a ramp, jump on the box and try again.  After 50 attempts I finally make it across.  Now I've got to make another jump, and another - they've got to be done in rapid succession or you'll get knocked off and have to start again.  So, I'm supposed to sit here, running around in circles, attempting this jump about 2,500 times?!?  Are you freakin' kidding me?  This is a first person shooter, not a platformer.  Gimme a break.About the only good thing I have to say about this game is that I bought it used for next to nothing.\n",
      "As my topic suggests, World of Warcraft does a lot of damage to the Warcraft Universe. Fans of the RTS games, who have followed the arcing storyline will be disappointed with this mess of a game.In an attempt to \"dumb\" this MMO enough for the masses to understand it, they pretty much destroyed the Warcraft Universe with some of the most mundane storylines I've seen in a game. I sometimes shudder to think this might be the end all of the Warcraft series, and can't for the life of me, picture what Warcraft 4 (the RTS) will have as it's story, since WoW has pretty much destroyed the foundation previously laid by the other games.The game mechanics are simple, at best. A new player gets to \"create\" their avatar (I use the word create loosely, as the customization provided by this game is laughable at best). After that, you start in the \"newbie\" area, where you will have to complete the usual mindless quests, i.e., go kill a certain amount of monsters and get a certain amount of items.Leveling is boring and easy for the first ten levels. At level 10, you are given \"talent points\" so that you can invest them in 3 trees of development. This is probably the only redeeming part of character development, because it does allow for more character differentiation. It is not enough, however, to save this mediocre game.Leveling constitutes completing a series of mind-numbing quests, which most likely, you'll rarely read, except to find out where to go and what you need to get. Any story \"told\" through the quest text is sleep-inducing anyhow.After you finally reach level 60 (if you are able to stand the boredom and repetitiveness) you can look forward to \"end-game\" content. This of course, requires you to actually belong to a decent guild. Odds are, however, that you'll be in one of the crappy guilds who get eaten alive in the harder game instances.In a nut-shell, after 60, you can look forward to either not being able to do the end-game instances or doing them over and over again, in order to get phat lootz, purplz, etc. Getting a full set of epic gear will take you a long time, so expect to do BWL at least a full year before you are able to get 8/8 of any of the epic armor sets. Yay, I hope you look forward to mindless repetition of these instances, over, and over again.\n",
      "I was told by some friends how great this game is and I bought it and played and for awhile I though it was good. Then after the second day I got tired of it. Now I never want to play this game again, worse I can't return the game. I am going to cancel my subscription in the next two days or so before they send me my first monthly bill. Really disappointing. I went back to playing Battlefield 2/Special Forces I will stick with that game until they come out with something better. Best part is that game is free to play online unlike this game. Get it and you will enjoy it.\n",
      "Interesting game at certain levels.  At low levels this game can be very fun.  lots of people and easier leveling make it very entertaining.  And then it stops... there is a pretty large gap in people and grouping from the low levels about 30ish until your level 70.  The game has become a solo grind until you get 70 because a majority of the game content is written for level 70 or is so outdated that its not useful or even possible to get people to explore the content on most occasions.  Once a character reaches level 70 it is pretty much a requirement for a person to devote themselves to either pvp which then is mostly a solo act again unless you happen to find an active pvp guild which can be very challenging and on a whole is a very limited experience. pvp requires that you grind for the gear that make a character able to compete with other characters.  very little of the pvp system relies on a players skill.  The other major option is to engage in PVE which the player can experiance a wide range of content.  this can be a very interesting way to explore wow though once again very quickly it becomes a limited venue do to the social demands of guilding and gear that are required to continue to explore the content.  Months can be spent to gain a new item that is only marginally better than a previous one and one that could be replaced in days if a player was willing to devote their free time and suffer the whims of a higher ranked guild.All for all.. if your a new player expect at least a couple of months of solo grinding to get your character to a point that you will be even socially eligible to be able to enjoy the majority of the content of the game.  If your willing to do that the game can be very fun.\n",
      "When the game came out things worked pretty well.  The glowing reviews were well deserved.  But with each passing day since, the bugs and stability have gotten worse.  It has now gotten to the point that the servers go down everyday.  And each time the servers go down the length of time they are down gets longer. Most of the time the servers are down for a few minutes to a couple of hours. Today it is now approaching 12 hours downtime and that is for nearly half the servers and the most popular ones.  It wouldn't be that bad if the downtimes were when most people were not playing.  But the downtimes almost always occur in the evening at the peak player times.There are many bugs that many players know about and go unfixed.  It has become the old doctor joke.  You know, the patient says \"Doctor, it hurts every time I do this\" and the doctor says \"Don't do that\".  That is how many players play the game, there are many things we are supposed to be able to do but when we do it the game locks up or crashes, among other things. So we avoid doing certain things. Again, with each passing day more and more bugs appear.The PVP(player versus player) system in the game is probably the worst and most pointless of any online only game in existence. This can be especially frustrating for players trying to level on a PVP server. There is supposed to be a system that punishes players from killing other players of a significantly lower level.  This is called \"ganking\". After the first couple of areas on a PVP server you enter areas that are PVP enabled, meaning the other faction can attack you.  Unless you have very high level players with you, you will be \"ganked\" and many times.  Which makes it very hard to level and complete missions in these areas.  After about level 15 you enter the PVP enabled areas.When you do PVP with players of nearly equal level there is no reward for winning or punishment for losing.  You also do not gain any experience.  It is pointless. The community has been screaming to Blizzard to give PVP meaning. Blizzard was supposed to have a meaningful PVP system in place when the game was released and have promised this ever since the game came out.  But, again, with each passing day, we are told something is coming soon.  We are still waiting.All things considered, with the server instability, the bugs and the meaningless PVP system I would suggest waiting to buy the game at this time.  I would wait about 3 to 6 months, check the latest reviews(make sure you read the date the reviews were submitted, don't be fooled by reviews that were written when the game first came out) to see if things have improved.(Edited August 13, 2006)As you can see the original review was written over a year ago.  What has happened since then?  If I didn't know better, it almost appears that Blizzard had my concerns at the top of the list for things to address.The game works almost flawlessly, with only the occasional down time, lags and bugs.  But honestly what MMO doesn't have these problems?  WOW now works as good or better than any MMO.Some people now say the PVP is the best part of the game and it is something that everyone should give a try, especially the PVP haters, you may be surprised how much you like it.Kudos to Blizzard for doing it right!\n",
      "There is a monthly charge to play online and game does not play offline was disappointed with the game not what I wanted at all.\n",
      "I bought this game thinking that I could play it on my own.  Nope.  Once you pay the fourty bucks for it, then you get the privilege of paying a monthly fee to play because it is only an on-line game.  Nothing mentioned in the Amazon ad about that.  I returned the game, and Amazon was very fair regarding a refund.  I think that all on line games are basically a rip off since it forces you to have to play to get your money's worth, which never happens because you always have to pay more!  Sorry, I am not into dealing with that since I have a life.\n",
      "I give this one star simply not because the game isnt good but the DVD is outdated you would be better off just buying it from Blizzards site online and downloading it as the DVD itself here will be worthless considering that pretty much all the content of World of Warcraft has been upgraded since Cataclysm.Why they have not pulled these disks and come out with a new boxed product say called World of Warcraft: The Shattering which contains most of the data needed for patch 4.03a so that it would actually be useful for those who either have slow downloads or like me have now have to deal with the stupid download cap that many ISPs are now putting on subscribers.  The game itself is great and the CD key that comes with it will give you the full game (and burning crusade too!) but this product as a boxed product is out of date.also if you are not sure about getting the game you can go on world of war-crafts website and play the game AS LONG AS YOU WANT FREE up until level 20 now!  which is pretty sweet.  Its a great game but just keep in mind this disk is out of date and aside for the key itself is pretty much useless.\n",
      "This game starts with the premise that the casual gamer can advance relatively easily and in a fun, meaningful way. You can, even as a casual gamer, reach the current level cap of 60 (Will be 70 when the expansion comes out later this year). The quests are fun and grouping is fun. The scenery is wonderful and the animations are quite good as well.All of that changes at level 60.Thanks to the game designers Jeff Kaplan and Alex Asfrasiabi, 2 ex-EQ1 hardcore guild raiders, this game shifts into overdrive at level 60. These two 16hr/day EQ1 idiots have managed to turn this game into a HUGE timesink raidfest at level 60. To put it mildly: If you don't have a hardcore raiding guild and aren't willing to put in anywhere from 4-6 hours nightly EVERY night, you'll be sitting around the capitol cities with your fingers up your rear doing absolutely NOTHING. Let me state that again: If you don't have 30-60 hours per week at level 60 to put into this game, you will be running the same low level instanced dungeons over and over...and over..and over..and over..and over..and over..and over again.They keep adding content but for whom? You guessed it: The hardcore elite. There is a ton of content that you, if you are a casual gamer, will never see. Nice of them to introduce new dungeons, bosses, loot etc that 80%+ of the playerbase won't see, eh?Thanks Jeff! Thanks Alex ASSfrasiabi!\n",
      "Hmmm where to start. Well I played for almost a year trying to find that 'interesting or rewarding part', it apparently doesn't exist. After level 5 (of 60, it takes about 4 months of playing daily to reach 60) the game-play becomes mundane, generally you get abilities that are damage or recovery from damage and the attention of the enemy monsters and kill things, thats it... There is no way to lose level or stay dead other than game bugs (there are plenty of those). Essentially if you played up to level 5 you've encountered everything it has to offer, later levels just mean more buttons and slightly different textures. Oh and the characters and geometry appears to be designed by an anti-social teenager, like the ones the draw pictures of distorted muscle men with giant shoulders... Interestingly enough that's the target market and the main player profile. You will encounter quests that tell you to murder people, commit genocide, and of course steal from your victims, with lots of racist and factionalism dialog! Essentially this is a game that can only be described as 'for sociopaths' and the mundane. The actual game mechanics are built to make sure more sophisticated and intelligent gamers have no advantage, and the reward system is based on time spent playing rather than accomplishment or skill. there are hours of filler in order to extend playtime ( in order to extend your subscription ) rather than compelling content. Fillers include time penalties, effects that make you wait until they expire, absurdly long and very slow travel, very low loot drops for items required for quests, extremely long and boring battles, and of course lots of server downtime. In the end I only feel that this game was a complete scam, a waste of my time and money, I feel ripped off and I will under no circumstance buy a game from blizzard or anyone that has worked for them.\n",
      "I'm fairly a newbie to Role Playing Games (RPG) and to gaming in general. I heard a lot about world of warcraft (WOW) before trying it out.I only tried it because I got a free trial from gamespy website. I took one look at it and was completely turned off by the cartoonish graphics and the fact that everybody in the game looked like monsters. I was starting to turn away from RPGs in general but I read some good reviews on Amazon about Guild Wars (GW) and decided to try it out to see if there was anything to it.Guild Wars blew me completely away. It rocks! I am totally addicted to it now. GW has extremely beautiful, realistic graphics. I mean exquisite! And the only monsters you see in it are the ones you have to fight. I know I end up writing a review for Guild Wars but I can't help it.WOW probably is a good game but I will never play it because I can't deal with the cartoon graphics and all the people looking like monsters. Moreover, $15 DOLLARS A MONTH! Get outta here. Not me. Guild Wars is much, much better------and it's free to play.\n",
      "This game, which I think is much like Diablo 2 (same general shutff), is addicting to no end.  You WILL be playing this game all the time, and you will feel like crap when you are not.  It is the same thing as tobacco withdrawl, expect virtual.  Most of the people who play (yes, most) are jerks who care only about gold and items and raids.  It is like a second life which gains importance over your first.  It also is not cheap to play this game... $15 a month which is $180 a year, which means some people have already payed $375 to play this game for 2 years.  Due credit is given to the developers however, because they created a immersive, enormous world plus a GOLDMINE!  Use your discresion when considering this purchase.\n",
      "Please don't discount me as a random detractor or as a noob.  I have plenty of end game experience on my 60 and my friends on theirs, and we share an opinion that this game is, in fact, fairly pointless and poorly done.  Although it is fun for a while, you get dragged in and then when you reach 60 you suddenly have no options for how to advance.  You can either become a mindless part of a guild in which you go on incredibly restrictive several hour raids in boring zones, or whither.  Most experienced mmo players would ask what the alternative is, or disagree because they think there are other options within this game.  The alternative is devising small raiding (20 person max) for the good gear so that players are part of a real group and also to put in more balanced content for crafting and pvp.  Thank heaven for Lord of the Rings Online; wait for that, don't play this trash.\n",
      "I thought this game was going to be fun, but it was not.  It was fun in the beginning when you could actually gain level kinda fast by yourself.  Soon though, you realize that gaining fast levels by yourself is an impossibility.  Instead you need to get in a group and just sit around while high levels kill everything for you.  Hurray what a blast.  Don't buy this game.\n",
      "First off you need to understand this game has actually gotten worse with time. Hard to beleive that 15 bucks a month leads to a worse game. Just for anyone curious I have to list off the main points of what is wrong.The combat system for the game is god awful. Five professions are super unstoppable strong, and the rest are relatively weak. The system is overly dependent on template strenght as opposed to player skill. In other words you can get by mashing one button. Then to top it off there is no variety reward. There is only one acceptable armor, and a handful of acceptable weapons. All the rest is garbage. In a game that did not have crafters that would make sense. Next on the list is the fact that the game now incorporates player powerups buffs. That are now mandatory, and must be administered by one player class. Not uncommon for a player to sit around in a city for an hour just to go out and kill something.Enviroment, and dungeons. Sure they are huge, but there is a problem. The game has a quick fix player vehicles. That can cover a on foot fourty five minute run in three or four minutes. Part of the fun is getting there. Now you are there in an instant. On a side note it does seem they tried to make the planets very atmoshperic, but what you get is too much of one thing or another. Tattoine for example is blinding bright, and dathomir is pitch black. You will find yourself fiddling with the filters in the game alot. Just so you can see where you are going. The dungeons are almost cookie cutter in nature. Out of the fourty dungeons in the game only five or six are worth playing. The good ones are always camped by players looking to loot rare items. Add to that alot of the dungeons have spawn timers on them in the game. So you can easily go to a dungeon and wait half an hour for the creatures to respawn.Lag the game is chopped full of it. Not uncommon to go in an area, and have it slow to 2 frames a minutes. Increadibly easy to just lockup and be helpless. This is not just an issue in heavily trafficed in game areas. It can afflict you at any place in the game.Crafting most likely the most well designed feature in the game. Its time conumeing, but rewarding. The entire system is rather well done, but is still afflicted by many bugs. To make matters worse. You will need to collect hundreds of resources to make everything you can make. Then the crafter simply shoves a schematic in a factory and waits three hours for the factory to get done. Most items are made on an assembly line basis, and are often sold in crates or huge quantities of items. Sadly after that you have to deal with the fact that ninety five percent of what you can make nobody wants.Professions the game has fourty titles to acheive. Not going further into the fact that many are broken worthless. Most of them can be done in under three days. Detracting from any satisfaction you might get from mastering them. Plus mastering a player class usually involves players being forced to do skills that are neither useful to the the final product, or give any real bonus at all.The economy and items. At this point the game is totally reduced to camping dungeons for rare super good items, or doing repetitive missions over and over. The ingame economy is flooded with easy money, and nothing to spend it on. The ingame missions are not only redundant, but are drained of all fun value. People do them because they have to do them, and there is nothing else to do. It breaks down like this you go to a terminal you grab two missions in the same direction. You pull out a bike ride out kill them usually with great ease, and return to the terminal and repeat. There is no variety at all. Even the bounty hunter missions are reduced to this. You simply have to take a few steps and go to another planet to run out and kill target. The quests are equally unfullfilling being that they are the same to missions, and have absolutely no storyline to follow.Galactic Civil War this is what starwars is all about right. Well not in this game. The pvp the fun part rarely happens due to the broken combat. There are no starwarsy events to participate in. Being in a faction rebel or imp is reduced to being able to wear a faction armor, and the imps get atsts pets. That they can only use on faction targets. This has gone on so long that neither side has any faction pride left, and its not uncommon for a player to see two opposeing overts standing and talking in the middle of a player city. Two players that are advertiseing they want to player vrs player are not even doing that.All in all the game is majorly broken. Ninety percent of the players playing the game will tell you they are sticking it out till the game gets better. People are playing out of hope that they will actually get a starwars game. Sadly with pathetic combats systems, enviroments, and no starwars to actually speak of buying and paying 15 bucks for this game is a real waste at this time. Maybe another year and a half from now. They might actually finish this product and make it fun to play.Also do not get blinded by other reviews with five stars. These are usually people who just started to play the game, and are overjoyed by the concept of a mmorpg. A new gameing style they have never seen. In mmorpg terms SWG is a wholey pathetic product.\n",
      "I had high hopes for this game.  I finally had broadband in my area, and what better way to test it than with online gaming, right?  The game in its current state can be summed up in one word:Boring.Run (or jog) for minutes at a time, look for needles in haystacks, kill vermin, and hope nobody kills you.  That's about it.  Sound adventurous?  No space travel.  No piloting of any craft.  You might get to ride a dewback, if you're lucky.I wish I could find someone to give my copy.  To get my money's worth I've given it a dual-purpose:  Door stop and paper weight.LucasArts and SOE really missed the mark with this one.\n",
      "You are paying for a product that is incomplete.  The only thing Star Wars about this game is the name of the planets.  I have been playing the *game* since launch and have yet to see any intresting depth or dynamic.  It tries to force players to roleplay and communicate by having insane amounts of downtown.  Normally though most people just go AFK during that downtime hoping someone will heal them.  The only intresting thing in the game is the crafting system but teh player driven economy means you will be spending all your time getting your own resources as there is no commodity market.The game does have promise, but I have played enough MMOs to know that 80% of the promises that companies make is a lie.  Look at Anarchy Online, Everquest, and so on... They keep stringing you along, getting that monthly fee while they finsih the game as you test it for them.  Maybe in a year with something other than boring missions and inane level grind SWG might be fun to play and hang out in... as for now, steer clear.\n",
      "You thought this would be better than everquest, playing a wookie on different planets, tons of nerding for sure. Unfortunately it is nothing BUT everquest. Sure it is addicting but the design is fundamentally weak and the graphics are brilliant but only because it is funded well.It's pretty much mmorpg back to the basics, don't get this game whatever you do\n",
      "I wish this game was good, I've owned it for a long time, this is the first 1 I've given a game. Some people say this game is great, and, I don't really want to be rude, but they were either high or freshly released from the looney bin, or it could have been the first MMO they played, I have to be honest, I liked this game when I first played it, it was the first MMO I played, but after playing GOOD games like WoW or CoH or Ragnarok (yes Ragnarok is better) I was disgusted at the game, it should not have been made. I have to admit that it could have been more, but it isn't what it should have been, buy WoW or CoH... or Ragnarok, just DON'T play this game...\n",
      "I played this game already and can say that it doesn't live up to the hype.  Don't expect anything new, or anything that even meets the new standards of gaming.  This game is like every other game on the market but dressed up as Star Wars for marketing purposes.  It's really boring, the textures aren't impressive at all and the characters are shallow.  Playing this game is comparable to being beaten by an old lady.\n",
      "You pay out the yeng yang for this game and then after you get it loaded, you discover that to get on-line to play you have to pay a monthly server fee!  I guess that will teach me to read the fine print...drat it, I totally missed that!!!  I suggest the game be cheaper to afford the monthly fees, or ix-nay the monthly server fees!  If you're not willing to fork out $65-$100 for a game, don't make the mistake that I did.\n",
      "I wrote a review when I first bought this game. I gave it 5 stars because of all the inovative ideas put into the game. I also raved about its excellent surrounding environment in the different planets you can chose to play in. I now take back what I have said with Part 2 of my SWG review.After noticing the fact that I used to play an hour a day, I was still just a novice pistoleer. Why is this? Because you have to play a LOT to become anywhere good in the game. A huge flaw in this game is that it takes no skill at all whatsoever. The entire game is based off of the amount of time clocked into your life to play. Your grandmother could play this game the rest of her life, knowing NOTHING about video games, and still do very well. Once past the steep learning curve in the game, all that stands in your way is time itself. If you have the time, then go ahead, no-lifer, play, play, play, and play, until you become a master marksman, or medic, or whatever.This isn't the worst problem though. The game is extremely repetative. Sure, going out with 15 people in Lok killing space bunnies with many different types of players is fun at first. Then you start to realize taht you can only make money by doing pointless missions and crafting weapons/armor for bigger and more extreme players. Alright, that isn't so much fun. Then we have the skill system. Possibly the only good part about the game, the skill system is a great way to mix skills to have more unique characters. Ok, you can be a master medic and a master pistoleer and a somewhat good creature handler, but what's after that? I don't know, absolutely nothing. Once you max out your skill points, the only thing else to do is to give up skills and start new ones (or if you are THAT good of a character, redo your skills again). Great, I am paying 15 dollars of my hard-earned money every month to learn max out about 12 different professions... Fun...And about that 15 dollars a month. Even within 2 months of release, servers are frequently down getting updated. Those 15 dollars are not going to the right places. When I had technical problems with the game, the SOE reps on the phone were not only giving me a big headache, but were so unprofessional that they were wasting my time, thus the 15 dollar phonecall to California that day. Atleast use that money to get better reps and to get people that actually know how to make good patches for the game. Then I might have considered keeping my account.Earlier I discussed repetativeness. Did I mention that there isn't one single vehicle that you are able to freely drive in this game? Sure, take a shuttle port to different cities, or a starport to different planets. GOOD LUCK walking 10,000 meters away from town for an 800 credit mission. Doing so will require you to use auto-run, thank god that was implemented. (For any players reading this review, it is the numlock key). I was able to watch the first quarter of The Screensavers on Tech TV and still have a few minutes before I got to my destination. The best players will be the ones with nothing else better to do than sit around holding the forward key, or watching your stupid character traverse across the world. Fun fun fun.All of this for a rediculous price of 15 dollars a month. I can easily have more fun playing Disney's new ToonTown MMORPG, which costs 4 bucks a month. Yay. I can even include a subscription to planetside - a critically acclaimed MMORPG - to still have a lower cost than ONE account to SWG. And I would probably have more fun playing these games as well.To conclude, the game was fun while it lasted. Now I am selling my perfectly conditioned game back to the store for 1/4 of the original price and moarning over the loss of 30 dollars, which I could have spent in much better ways. This is the last of my money Sony Online Entertainment is getting from me.\n",
      "I had high expectations for Star Wars Galaxies, and who didn't?  It promised to be the revolution in MMORPGs.  But revolution it's not.  After the first 5 minutes of Galaxies, I knew I was in for a big nasty surprise.  First off, no one is in charactor, absolutely no one.  And if you want to talk to someone, you better type &quot;WAIT!&quot; as quick as you possibly can, because people move far too fast to talk to them as they go by.Another problem out of the many Galaxies has, are the missions.  I mean...when I saw the caption &quot;and now for the greatest Star Wars Saga ever told&quot;  I figured I was in for an adventure.  What I was really in for, was farm labor...thats right, you find yourself working as a Rat Hitman half the time.  Normally the missions break down like, someone has a farm, and they need you to kill this nest of critters to save their crops.There are good things about this game, don't get me wrong.  In my travels, I saw alot of things that impressed me, for instance the cantinas and such.  However, I saw nothing that warrants a 50 dollar purchase.  I'm sure there are people with good arguments as to why this is a good game, however to me, I found it to be dull, poorly made, and glitchy.The point here is, this game is just not finished, there really isn't any other way to put it kindly.  They needed to release something, and it was released to early, with far too many cut corners.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but diehard fans of the series.PROS:Nice graphicsHuge areasFactionslots of skills and weaponsCONS:GlitchesLagToo many patchesno one ic.\n",

      "Buying Star Wars Galaxies: $20Installing and patching the game: 2 hoursRealizing that the manual you read during that time along with the strategy guide that you picked up talk about an entirely different SWG than the one you are playing and are thus useless?  Priceless.There are some games that are fun and rewarding to play.  For everything else - there's Sony.Sony Online Entertainment has turned this game into a severely bugged shadow of it's former self.  A new first-person-combat system similar to planetside was shoved into the game, breaking the previous systems and returning the game to an Alpha-state.If you're fine paying $15 per month for what is essentially an alpha-test on servers which are devoid of all but 10 - 15 players at a time, by all means; pick this up.If you value the money you work for and would like to play what this game is trying to be - spend your money on Battlefront 2 instead.  If you want a decent MMORPG, I suggest anything not marketed by Sony Online Entertainment.Worst customer service ever.\n",
      "In 1977 I was four years old.  My mom says she took me to see the first Star Wars in the theater but I don't remember it.  I DO remember ESB and ROTJ.  And I certainly remember growing up in that time where THE toys to have were Star Wars related.My point?  I grew up waiting for a game like SWG.  When it came out in 2003 I was ecstatic and I've been playing it ever since.  Sure, there were always problems with it, but what MMO pleases everyone all the time?  Yet I stuck with it through some very rough spots because I had faith that no matter how bad it got it would always get better.  After all, who could screw up Star Wars?Well, now I have the answer to that question.  SOE can, apparently.  I played EQ and watched as it devolved into a game for uberleet lewt wh*res, so perhaps I should've seen this coming.  I'm torn whether I'm to blame for my naivete or SOE is for their abominable handling of the Star Wars license.In the end it doesn't matter.  Because the bottom line is that SOE has absolutely crushed its playerbase with the recent \"Combat Upgrade\".It used to be that the game economy was player based.  No longer.  Crafters can barely step outside their houses lest they get one-shot killed by a creature that resembles a bunny.  Insert Monty Python joke here, if you please.It used to be that combatants had some solo content and wouldn't have to spend hours finding and maintaining groups.  No longer.  Soloing in the game is frustrating at best, impossible at worst.It used to be that the vast majority of equipment worth having was made by player crafters.  And while that may still be true, with every patch and \"upgrade\" it becomes less true as SOE desperately courts those for whom loot is the only thing in the game worth pursuing.It used to be that patches and upgrades for SWG, while never bug free, at least were given a reasonable amount of time in the Test Center for beta testing.  No longer.  The CU was released with almost no substantive beta testing.  What little beta testing DID exist made utterly no difference, as the feedback from beta testers was completely ignored.I could go on, but what's the point, really?  The bottom line is that SWG, as it exists now, is a terrible, terrible game.  Buyer beware.  Buyer be-VERY-ware.I am a longtime gamer and you can trust me when I tell you that your hard-earned money is best spent outside of SOE's coffers.\n",
      "I loved this game. When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called \"Combat Upgrade\" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different. If you want Star Wars, take it from me: this is no longer it, and is not worthy of anyone's hard-earned cash.\n",
      "No use buying it now, Sony killed the game off with the Combat Upgrade. It was so much better before, but these clowns have taken a great game and just hacked it all apart.\n",
      "Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided*Sigh* Where to begin...This game could be better named:\"Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base\".Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).*Wave Hand* \"This is not the game you are looking for... Move along!\"PLEASE, READ ON...In the beginning...This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the \"Star Wars\" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any \"Smuggler\" in the game for their opinion.They strung us along and led us to believe that the \"fixes\" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an \"Expansion Pack\" to sell us! And then once again \"promised us\" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, \"just hang on, this game is going to be great!\" They promised us that they were going to do this \"Combat Upgrade\" and do it right, and it \"wouldn't be released until it's ready!\"We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figured out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited \"CU\" would be coming out along with the \"Rage of the Wookiees\" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the \"CU\" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could \"streamline\" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or \"EverStar Galaxies QuestWars\" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.You have been warned!\n",
      "This review will be short and sweet: save your money. Here's why...As with the (disappointing) post-Verant International expansions to Sony's popular \"EverQuest\" franchise, \"Star Wars: Galaxies\" is very short on content, but very high on greed-driven programming choices. For one thing, forget about making multiple characters on the same account... a courtesy which nearly every previous \"MMORPG game\" ever created has featured. In \"Star Wars: Galaxies,\" you are forcibly limited to *one* and \"only one* character per paid account, period. If you play for 3 months, and discover that you hate that character, you must start all over again from scratch (and will have wasted your previous subscription fees, naturally). Unlike every other game which has preceded it, \"Galaxies\" does not allow you to try out different characters simultaneously until you settle upon the one which you like best. The only possible reason for such an imposed limitation is a simple one: GREED. Sony wants your subscription fees, and this is an obvious ploy to milk as much money from their subscribers as possible. I could accept this a bit better if the game content warranted it, but it does not (the game world is entirely too small and bland overall).Additionally, when greed such as this so rudely limits the gameplay options, combined with the typically poor to nonexistant customer support (already made famous by Sony's infamous \"EverQuest\" experience)... well, such lack of concern for the gamer *frequently* becomes invasive to the gameplay experience itself.And that's simply not very much fun, unless you enjoy roleplaying a sucker lining the pockets of grinning Japanese businessmen... um, no thanks.\"Star Wars: Galaxies\" has (thus far) managed to disappoint nearly everyone who has courageously given it a try. Unless you are SERIOUSLY hung up on the \"Star Wars\" films, and simply can *not live* unless you get to be a Han Solo clone in an extremely limited gameplay world, I would recommend passing on this one. Save your money for a more promising game (such as the upcoming \"Worlds of Warcraft\" for example).Another big thumbs down.EDITING ADDITION: Back when I wrote this review in August, I was still waiting for Sony to patch and fix the immense number of bugs in SWG. I assumed (based upon Sony's infamous prior history of exploiting their customers and forcing us all to PAY to be Sony's beta testers) that SOE would eventually make the necessary repairs that this game required. After all, the game had only been released fairly recently when I wrote this review. Well, here I am still waiting for those fixes, and it is now October of 2003.Have they finally properly patched and fixed the unbelievable plethora of bugs in Star Wars Galaxies..? They have not. What's worse... when you complain to them, they become condescending towards you, their paying customer, and attempt to make you feel as if you \"simply do not get it.\"Oh, I get it alright: SWG, just like most other Sony games, is simply a \"get-rich-quick-before-they-catch-on-to-us-and-cancel\" scheme. The various patches applied to this game have made the problems worse, not better. Classes have been nerfed to the point of being nearly un-playable, no one wants to play medics because they are generally unrewarding, hospital-type areas where players MUST go to heal up after battles are overcrowded due to lack of services, and generally, everything in this game seems geared toward making you wait days or weeks before you enjoy even a tiny amount of meaningful \"progress.\" Days or weeks that you continue to pay for, whilst getting little to no satisfaction from either the game itself, or Sony's nearly non-existant customer support.My advice..? I hate to say it, but at this point I favour a MASSIVE and TOTAL BOYCOTT of ALL products from Sony Online Entertainment. Since greed is apparently the sole motivation they have behind their various decisions and practises... then fine: hit them where they apparently live. Hit them in their wallets. I just did... I cancelled every subscription I had to ALL the Sony Online Entertainment games I had been playing, including EverQuest (after nearly 4 years)... another game SOE has managed to nearly destroy after buying the franchise from Verant International.\n",
      "The game was playable before the combat Revamp. No, things werent perfect. I played for 2 years, and personally discovered every inconvienient bug in the game, from having my money dissappear, to being killed repeatedly because I couldnt fight back. But now, I am ready to give up. The customer support has gone from bad to either nonexistant, or blatantly antagonistic, and 9/10 the professions in the game no longer work at all. the other 1/10 work partially. And forget it if you try and make a new character. It is impossible to level. This from a guy that went from novice to master rifleman in 5 days in the old system without working hard.\n",
      "That what pretty much describes this game. Pure 100% garbage, trash-junk how much junk when the orginal box set is now under $5 bucks that is pretty much talking volumes. The The Total Experience is for some odd reason now over $60. and the Star Kit $15. SOE can make all the changes they want, just they better not except people to put and pay for trash. There products are simply not worth the time, grief and grind time anymore. Once upon a time this was a very unique game-nothing but junk.  The time for SWG is pretty much over-the only way that SOE maybe able to save this game, if they swallow there pride, there stupidty and go back to the orginal format, but that will create a new problem. For those who did it with the CU and the NGE assuming the game is around that long. Leave it to SOE to put themselves into a catch 22 either way there going to lose.\n",
      "My wife and I bought this and dove into the Star Wars universe full of hope and expectation. After all, what can possibly be lacking in anything with the Star Wars name?Oh boy. Let me be a little technical first before giving my gut feelings...The INTERFACE was good at first glance. Not great, just good. It could have been far better. Some controls can be re-written, some can't and some re-written controls interfere with others when they aren't supposed to. For instance, chatting was a chore if you attempt to rekey anything on the keyboard. You don't want to be involved in a CHORE when you're fighting, talking and trying to stay alive.The PvP is jacked all to heck and back with just a couple of classes being way over-strengthed with &quot;uber-rock-your-world-pwn&quot; abilities and or equipment. There is no reason at all to engage in PvP unless you just want to hear the other guy scream obscenities at you. Plus, the game is overrun with pets. Don't bother picking a mano-a-mano fight - those don't exist. You have your pets do all the fighting.The WORLD is limited. A handful of planets with an area mapped out on each. Plenty of room to run around, but not much out there. Most of your time will be spent in cities getting killed over and over in spaceport.The GAMEPLAY is somewhat like AO. Players can take missions for money, exp and faction points. Unfortunately, the missions send you out to only 2 different types of mission points: either a metal outhouse with 3 guys around it, or a smoking pile of poop with several animals around it. The SWG game was bought from UO as the defunct UO2 system, so I understand, which is why the game is based on animals and skins and bones and gut puddings...The CRAFTING is at first impressive. At first. Both I and my wife took up crafting when we saw PvP was so pointless that we had nothing left to do. Diablo2 made my wrist ache sometimes, but no game like SWG has ever jacked my wrist all to heck. You WANT carpal tunnel? Play this game as a crafter. And I macroed as much as I could.The BUGS in this game have yet to be fixed... whole classes broken, whole faction perks broken, nerfs to anything that gets whined about on the official boards... what's the worst you can imagine? SWG has it.If you like the rebels, join this game. Rebels rule every single world in the SWG and walk the planets fully declared. The Empire has absolutely ZERO ballz in this universe. The Emporer is wetting his robe.Okay, my gut feelings... this game has been taken over by the Pokemon players. You want to PvP? Make sure you have some handy Poke-pets to whip out of your datapad and say &quot;a&quot;. That's the game. There are hardly any droids to speak of and this is supposed to be Star Wars? This game is a joke. I watched Star Wars in its theater debut in the 70s. This game bears NO resemblance. Background effects of TIE engine whines don't count when the whole game is based on Pokemon.But hey, that's the majority of the audience... kids that grew up with Pokemon and liked it. SWG is Pokemon in Space and it won't ever change.\n",
      "Am I the only one that thought that Civ3 outright sucked?  Civilization and Civ2 were Earth-shattering for me.  Then \"Call to Power1 & 2\" became favorites.  Civ3 just seemed like a huge step backwards.  Anyway, along comes Medievil: Total War.  MTW is actually two games in one.  It is a military/dictatorship strategy game on the one hand.  Expect intuitive city management and troop creation menus.  However, it is also an awesome combat engine.  You can lead your troops DURING a battle.  You can decide if it makes more since to have your longbowman fight melee style or leave that to your spearmen (which I strongly suggest).  Everything about MTW is polished and intuitive.  Comparing MTW to Civ3 would be like comparing Halo (the coolest game ever for those of you that haven't played Halo - drop what you are doing and get it) to Quake1 - they are both \"first person shooters\" but Halo has taken it to a whole new galaxy.  Do not waste your hard earned money on Civ3.  MTW is an intuitive addictive strategy game that won't let you go.\n",
      "Civilization was one of the computer games which gave me my enthusiasm for gaming way back in computer gaming's Bronze Age. Civilization 2 was unquestionably an enormous leap forward with the core design of the original game. I also very much loved Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri: in some ways, it is my favorite of the three games, and I still play it quite often.So of course I bought Civilization 3 the moment it was available. Oddly, I stopped playing it after two months. I told myself that it was because I was busy, or distracted by other games, or by events in my life. In preparation for the release of Play the World, I decided to start playing Civ 3 again.The first problem with Play the World, unfortunately, is Civilization 3 itself. It's just not a very good game. It has some good ideas--the effect of culture, for example--which are mostly badly implemented and lead to extremely frustrating or annoying gameplay. Does anyone enjoy conquering an enemy city, moving troops back out of the city, having it revert to its original holder no matter what you do, reconquering it, and so on until the city is reduced to size 1? The paradoxical effect of culture, designed to allow for peaceful absorption of other civilizations, is that it often leads to a much more genocidal approach to military conquest. There's a lot like that in Civ3: design elements that may be interesting ideas (or not) but that don't work well at all as implemented.Now I foolishly ventured into getting Play the World just to see whether that made a difference. I'm not sure whether multiplayer would make the game better because multiplayer in Play the World doesn't work unless you're on a LAN. Thank God I bought it from a store where I could return it. I'm disappointed because the one thing I have looked for from Firaxis is a certain degree of professional reliability. Play the World is in terms of basic bugginess and functionality one of the worst major releases in the past year.\n",
      "I felt ripped-off. I love Civ III, but this add-on is total trash. Nothing to it. It is only good for their pocket books, I was very let down that this trash was put on the market. It is not worth even a dime!!! Wyatt Kaldenberg\n",
      "***Spoilers alert***In one of those rare instances where you play someone other than a Jedi in a Star Wars game, Bounty Hunter provided a very interesting and highly entertaining thrill-ride through the underbowels of Star Wars planets.Such levels as Coruscant take you from the roof tops of some of the middle-level buildings, to the lower levels where shady nightclubs and such are.  Other levels take you to very interesting and highly lavishly built levels which provide a complex and interesting backstory as to how and why Count Dooku (pretending to be Syfo-Dias) chose Jango Fett to be the clone prototype for the Republic's clone army.The gameplay is solid, and Jango is very powerful, and not invincible.  His weapons are easy to figure out, and fun to use, and his jetpack is very useful in almost any situation.  You have the ability to lock on to opponents with your guns, though this does not guarantee that all shots will hit, it certainly makes it easier when shooting and attempting to evade a flurry of blaster bolts hurled at you, and you not being a Jedi deflecting them with a lightsaber.Unfortunately for a well crafted game, its biggest and ultimately fatal flaw is that it has absolutely no replayability.  It has a relatively short campaign of some 12 missions or so, and that is it.  There is no multiplayer, either online or with other controllers, there are no additions to the campaign or non-storyline battles you can do.  There is only the campaign, and once that is over, you are essentially done with the entire game.  Perhaps waiting a year would make it worth playing again, but otherwise this is not a game you should buy expecting too much.\n",
      "Really, be honest. This has got to be the WORST LucasArts game out there, besides the fact that they all are really horrible. The game has no real objective, besides get the bounty on an alien, while shooting five hundred others that look exactly alike. The gameplay is like a broken record.1st, you scan an alien.2nd you capture him dead or alive.3rd repeat the process for 18 levels, while being blasted by dozens of other aliens that don't die until they have about fifty red hot laser beams in them.I really fooled myself buying this without renting it first...I wasted --- dollars on a game that isn't worth two. The long and the short of it? Do not buy this game, unless you like to be driven to the nearest padded room in a white coat...\n",
      "I haven't played this game but I've read the reviews from other gamers and I feel that this game is just a ploy to get the space war fans first before Star Wars Galaxies comes out, which from the reviews looks to be incredible and will definatly lay this game to waste.  SWG took the cake at the game show 1st place. I think anyone concidering buying this game should think twice and read the reviews for Star Wars Galaxies and compare them to this game reviews and see for yourself.  Save your pennies... its only around the corner.\n",
      "This game has been unplayable for five years now.  I am aghast at why this is still for sale when it cannot be played.  Is there really such a thing as a \"GAME COLLECTOR\" who would be interested in making the game a part of some grand collection?And just for clarity, there is no single player mode and no way to host your own mini-universe for it.Again, not sure why it is still being sold when it cannot be played and why the sellers are not noting this in their product pages.  Here is a quote from one of the vendors \"PC Game complete in box with all contents - cds are in great shape and play great...\"  Hmm.. CDs play great eh?  How?Sorry for being so down on this, it is not my style to be rude, but I have been burned four times now with ONLINE UNIVERSE games that sellers failed to mention could no longer be played.Hail Flavius!\n",
      "Wasn't horrible while it lasted. except for some serious balance issues and lack of content.  However this game was canceled.  You cant play it anymore the most you will ever get to do is watch the intro so unless you need the box for your collection. I would not buy this and I can't believe they are still allowed to sell this.  Want a good spaced based MMO  go with EVE Online.  It doesn't have much in the way of PVE content, but the PVP contents is expansive and beyond any MMO I have played.  With a complete Player based economy and only a small portion of space patroled by npc's. (There are 5000 solar systems to set up shop in so even the npc petroled areas are pretty big) you don't have to be a pirate, but the danger sure makes being a trader more interesting. you really don't like danger. then you can still run missions, trade goods, and mine ore in high security space, but its not nearly as valuable.\n",
      "this game is terrible.if your going to play this game you NEED to have a VERY powerful computer with incredibly fast internet. because there is no single player. or at least you dont want to play it because it is about as entertaining as CSPAN. the bots are worse than any game ive ever seen even the old 8 bit games has FAR better bots that could actually do damage to you. you can literally walk behind a bot forever and they will not see you. you can stand in a room of them and they will not even moove.but yet you can get sniped all the way across the map by a RPG or pistol by a bot.the multiplay is also very bad.the servers are run by 43 year old unemployed loosers that try to make themselves feel better about themselves by banning everyone who wont sercumb to their insults. BTW you cannot get unbanned and there are only about 3 servers that have more than 5 people playing in them.for the sake of money and having a JOB do not get this game. get a NES and have a game that will be WAAYYY better thatll last 30+ years.\n",
      "I was really looking forward to buying and playing Battlefield 1942.  I had heard so much hype about it.  You know what?  You need a super computer to play this game.  Now don't tell me to go buy a newer computer because I already have a new computer.  I have a Dell 1.7GHz with 256MB RAM and a 32MB Nvidia Geforce 4 Graphics Card.  No matter what setting I put this game on, this game lags and movement of everything is very slow. I ended up taking the game back to the store and putting in a preorder for the expansion pack to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which comes out next month. I never had any trouble at all with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and it ran as smooth as silk on my computer.  Electronic Arts (EA) has published both Battlefield 1942 and Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and I can't believe they would let Battlefield 1942 be published with all of the bugs in it.  This game needs alot of work and alot of patches to be able to work right.  I'm very disappointed that EA released this game so early with so many bugs.\n",
      "This is the most dissapointing PC game I have bought in quite a while. I enjoyed the earlier Duke titles and thought they were great FPS games. The Manhatten Project retains some of the feel of the previous Duke games but is not up to par with its ancestors.  The biggest complaint I have is with the user interface.  It is nearly impossible to control the on-screen character with either keyboard commands or the joystick.  Also, the horizontal only movement and the third person perspective does not work well with a shoot-em-up such as this.  I like the graphics and the game concept but control is of paramount importance in a shooter and this game just does not have it.\n",
      "If you liked Duke Nukem 3D, you may hate Manhattan Project. I've just wasted [amt] on this game. Problem is that you CANNOT move forward or back! You can ONLY move left or right. I thought there was a problem with my joystick/keyboard/config/etc but No that appears to be the way this game was made. I ran Duke 3D and it worked perfectly. I was really looking forward to this game and am a little upset at the [dummy] who decided to make it a \"side scroller\" as it just does not make sense. This is exactly why people \"borrow\" software and I wish I would have done that as I could have saved some money.\n",
      "I'll be brief since this game is NOT worth wasting much time on.Short Version:If you have ever played any other football game on any other platform this one will probably disappoint.This is the worst football game ever (on any platform, going back to 1981)This is the worst XBOX game that I've seen.Graphics = Dworst of any XBOX football game, even last years madden for the PC was much better.  Truely disappointing.  For example the goal posts don't look like poles, but a stack of poorly aligned Lego blocks (very bad jaggies)Sound = C+so-so.  Nothing special, nothing horrible.  Very few choices and very redundent after 5 mins.Features = FMissing even simple things.  You can not review your roster, or set your starters.  There is no coach-mode, only arcade play.  Doesn't even pretend to be a sim.Supposedly you can import players from this game into Madden 2003, but what would be the point when the players in this game do not have any names?  And don't seem to be based on actual players?Gameplay = FVERY VERY VERY BAD.  Play last years NFL Fever 2002 for an example of how an arcade football game should play, or last years Madden 2002 for the PC for an example of how a strategy football game should play (or if you want, try an oldie called Front Page Sports FootBall Pro for even a better example of a strategy football sim).\n",
      "Don't believe me?  Take a stroll over to the NCAA 2003 message board at EA Sports' website and examine the multiple discussions over the XBox version both freezing and resulting in &quot;disc dirty/damaged&quot; errors during saving/loading.Coulda been a great game.

      "I have a question for all the reviewers, professional and otherwise, how can you write a favorable review on a software program that I, like several other people I know, cannot get the game to install even on &quot;state of the art&quot; computers. Further and in my experience, EA as an organization, give only lip service to customer/tech support. The Madden franchise, in my opinion are poorly designed, faulty products. It should be avoided, no matter how much you love football, at all costs.Unless, of course, unable to install, constant crashes(Madden 2002), and failure to issue roster updates is your forteNote to PC sport games - Oh great Microsoft, have pity on the poor pc gamer and bring back NFL fever to us\n",
      "My Tomb Raider game is filled with bugs! Within 10 minutes of downloading it, I had to restart my computer 3 times! When the game does show up, I get a blank screen. I can hear the sounds and all but there are no pictures! Whatever I do I cannot get it to work. I've tried so many websites for help! I've waited a year for this and now I wish I didn't get it. Maybe it's just my game? But other people have been having the same problems too. Well, at least the box is cool. |=(\n",
      "I've always enjoyed Tomb Raider games. But I bought this game, and it did not work on my computer. My computer didn't match the maximum requirements (which they don't show you until AFTER you open the box), but it did match the minimum requirements. I didn't buy this from amazon.com, but I bought it from a different store. They had this stupid policy that you can't get a full refund if you opened it. How the heck are you supposed to know that it doesn't work, if you can't open it?!Anyway, after a while, I got a PS2. So I decided to try it on PS2. It worked, but it's not that fun. It's almost impossible to control Laura. There are certain points in the game that you have to be at an exact angle to jump onto a ledge, and you can spend like a half hour trying to jump onto the stupid ledge. It's also not that fun because one of the \"cool new features\" is that she can only hold on for a certain amount of time. If you want to stay on a ledge for longer, you need to break a window, or kick a door down. Then she looses her strength again.\n",
      "I dont know if any of you guys remember the first doom on Super Nintindo, but this game is similar to it and that is sad! Today games should be around the level of high-tech. For example halo 2, games need to stay in that level or continue to get better which they are, (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and future game systems to come).Back to the reviewGraphics: 2-D things in a 3-D world  1/10Gameplay: bad  4/10Sound: good and bad  3-5/10Story: didnt really pay close attention  0/10Replayable: NO  0/10This game shouldn't have been for xbox at all. Its a discrace to xbox and the unreal series. Save your money for something better unless you really like the old stuff.\n",
      "This game just had so much potential. Sweet graphics, cool storyline, gameplay like Halo, Xbox Live Play. What the hell happenned then? I popped the game into my xbox, started a Single Player game and was immediatly greeted with an ugly cutscene that looked like it was programmed for the Atari Jaguar. I thought &quot;Well ok... the graphics will get better... and the gameplay will kick ass... right?&quot; WRONG! I got into my first battle and I thought I had a slow mo cheat on. I mean, the game was chugging at about 3 frames per second. To make matters worse, the monsters have 2 frames of animation. And no, I am not exagerating- the monsters literally look that pathetic. As the game was pretty much unplayable at that point, I just gave up &quot;playing&quot; (more like watching a flip book) and sold it as fast as I could. Not having Xbox Live, I could not test the online component of the game... but it has to be better than single player. Overall, I would stay far way from this and go buy Halo or Halo 2 or Brute Force or pretty much any First Person Shooting game out there. If Atari had actually taken the time to iron out all the bugs, Unreal 2 actually has some ass-kicking potential. As it is, the game is an over-hyped piece of junk.\n",
      "i'm a big fan of military and FPS (well this one is 3rd person, anyway) games. this is the worst squad game i've ever played. your teammates do not react as a real human would: they stand and try to shoot ennemies in plain sight, a group of ennemies appear and your teammates do not even go to find a spot to hide, way too many bugs, your teammates shoot but they do not dudge ennemies bullets (what is that wall next to u for?!). an enemy throws a grenade and your teammate do not even jump out from the area or throw back the grenade to the enemy, etc.they might walk like commandos/spec ops, shoot precisely like commandos/spec ops, but they do not respond at all like commandos/spec ops: i approach an entrance and these guys do not even get to hide on both side before the entrance nor a guy is watching my back. i go inside a building, these guys do not even follow me in line. u call that teamwork?this game is only good in multiplayer.not even worth a star. not even worth to buy.go for Star Wars Republic commando. now that's what i call a squad that respond according to the situation with real military procedures.\n",
      "Sly Cooper & the Thievious Raccoonus is a dumb game. The grafics are like a cartoon which is kind of cool but after a while it gets annoying. The game is hard too. I couldnt get past the 3 level. Dont get the game.\n",
      "I spent about 10 minutes playing this game before I realized what a bad game it is. I love the cell shading, and I wish PS2 would have more games, better games that is, with art like this one. However, I found this game to be far too simplistic to be enjoyable. You don't get a health meter. AT ALL! If you touch ANYTHING you're not supposed to (for me, it was a plant) you die instantly and are sent back to the beginning. If you fall into the water you die instantly. If you die three times you start all over, like you did in old Nintendo games.True, I didn't get past the first level so I don't know if this situation improves at all, but for a game to have that kind of set up in the first place is pointless. Hasn't gaming come far enough in the past 20 years that have rendered the concept of \"how many lives I do I have left?\" totally useless? My suggestion: Rent it and see for yourself.\n",
      "Never played any Madden game before, I tried one out with Madden 2003 of PS2 that I recently bought for two bucks at a flea market. I am not a fan of PS2, but I was curious about the game. I had hoped that the game would be satisfying to the point of being a good football game, a worthwhile game to play. Alas, it turned out not for me. My greatest fear was quickly realized: too many buttons on the controller, thus a very complicated gameplay. The more I played the game, the less I liked it. The longer I went with the game, the more my wrists and fingers hurt. I was more annoyed by the long pauses and loading times during the waiting periods and most especially between plays of the game. I was like, \"Just freaking snap the ball and get on with the drive\" or \"Loading for what? What's taking so long? Let's get moving.\" I swear that it was like being trapped being forced to watch the endlessly long commercials during an actual NFL game. I found the complicated buttons for different moves utterly ridiculous. I couldn't even remember everything for players in different positions, offense and defense. I was like, \"Why can't there be a single button for everything, only that I'll trust the player's discretion to make a move best suited for the moment?\" That would have simplified everything for me. Anyway, I am from old school, and my days were filled with Atari and 8 bit Nintendo. To this day, the greatest football game ever made was Tecmo Bowl. Later, it got replaced with Tecmo Super Bowl. Anyone who has played the game will quickly agree with me. The game play is so absurdly simple; the action is quick and fast; and there are no pauses between plays. It just flows well, and the game per se rewards back with a lot of great moments. The celebrations in the end, also the dramatic moments, are the best parts of the game. All in all, Madden 2003 is an awful game, and I can't play it anymore. Just give me Tecmo Bowl any time of the day over this cumbrous junk.\n",

      "After many re-installations, I have given up on this game.  It keeps crashing my six-month old computer running XP.  After I installed a new hard drive after my old one got corrupted due to a virus, I reinstalled Scrabble to see if it would work again.  The game loaded up okay, but when I went to play it against Maven the computer player, the game was on auto-pilot!  I had no control over what words I could make on my turn -- the computer program was doing everything!!  Obviously, there are some serious bugs in this game.  I am very disappointed that once again I blew $20 on a game I cannot play.  There are no patches on the company's website, either.\n",
      "Can't get this program to work with Windows XP at all. Screen goes black and locks up the computer. Atari does not offer any kind of patch to fix their program, but suggests you open Windows Task Manager and start shutting down all the background program on your computer to eliminate conflicts. Sorry, but I'm not shutting down my anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall programs to play a stupid video game!\n",
      "Just a word of warning for anyone expecting a completely new game.  Before you pre-order this title, take a look at the screenshots for the new game.  You can find some on the company's website or any PC game review website.  The sequel looks EXACTLY like the original game.  They've altered the roller coaster design features a little and inserted a few different rides but overall, this game is almost a carbon copy of the first one.  If you enjoyed Corkscrew Follies and the other expansion game, this game is for you as all it really is is more maps and a few more rides but if you're expecting something different (which I always do with sequels) you're going to be horribly disappointed.  Even the graphics engine is still the same.  This game is primarily meant to cash in on one of the most popular game series ever.\n",
      "After playing EU2, I was very excited about this game.  As a graduate with a history and political science major in college, I was extremely impressed with the historical accuracy of EU2 which engaged the player in the historical milieu of Europe from 1450 through 1820.The problem with this game is that unless you want to play a major power, you have no chance of having any fun.  I tried playing Poland, South Africa and Ethiopia.  With Poland, I worked with the idea of at least holding off Germany with a decent defensive war.  Unfortunately, starting in 1936 gave me three years to try to undo all the Polish military shortfalls.  Even with the 20/20 hindsight of history, I could not stop the Germans juggernaut.  Likewise, good luck if you play Ethopia.  If you are required to play the major powers to have any chance of success, it completely undoes the fun of EU2, in which you could play any country and with some skill and luck, make a reasonable show of skill and change the course of history, which is why you are playing this game.In EU2, I was able to make the declining power, Venice, into a Mediterranean power, defeating Turkey.  Likewise, I was able to change history completely when Poland eliminated Russia, allied with Austria and survived to fight Napoleon or when Brittany decline to accede to be part of France or a lackey of England.  In this game, the short time span makes it impossible to do anything with the minor powers.  Thus, it essentially allows you to fiddle with Nazi Germany to see if it can defeat Russia early and stop the Allies in the West: Whoopee!! I get to make the genocidal maniacs succeed, how fun!This is a game with a ton of possibilties that is limited by a too short time frame.  If it started in 1918, then there might be  a chance to make the game fun playing unusual minor powers.  As it stands, just pray you survive the Nazi onslaught if you decide to play the Allies.  Very disappointing.\n",
      "Crash died years ago.  The original should have been the first and only.  Sony even realised these games were garbage, and sold the liscence to Konami so they could produce this game on Xbox and GameCube and let them suffer low sales.  Good idea on Sony's part.

      "To start it off, don't buy it, heck, don't even rent it. The graphics are horrible for what a Gamecube can crank out. And all of these different grooves to fight in, whats with that? Also, the gameplay gets really repedative. All of the characters look [strange] and there moves stink! If I could I would give it a negative 5 stars. If you want a good game get Def Jam Vendetta, it even has 4 player action. But, don't waste your money on this load of [fluff].\n",

      "I won't sugar-coat your expectations here; this game is bad. It's almost worse than bad, and it's no wonder Sega had to resort to giving copies of it away with the Xbox in the winter of '02. It just wouldn't move on its own, the entire package is so shoddy and second rate. Your expectations for a pack-in game are already a little bit lower than they would have been if you'd spent an extra fifty dollars on it, but even with those downgraded standards I can't fathom how word about this game's ugliness didn't quite reach me before that fateful day when I finally decided to give it a shot. It's so bad, I'm surprised I didn't notice a foul odor coming from the clam shell.Where the average racer does a good job of giving you the sensation of control, the feel of horsepower underneath your thumb and a fair idea of how most cars respond to such insane acceleration, Sega GT accomplishes none of these. Its use of vibration, an oft-overlooked key component of the experience, is slim at best and often amounts to nothing more than a quiet stir, should you happen to drive over a huge patch of rocks. Acceleration feels more like a ride on the ferris wheel than a moment behind the wheel of a earthbound rocket ship, as your car will join four or five others in ever-so-gently building their way up from a standstill to a moderate speed. It's like jumping into the body of a sixty year old woman, mildly confused behind the wheel of her Lincoln Continental, and racing against similarly-maligned spirits in one of the most  anticlimactic experiences I've ever put myself through. Turning is a slow, arduous process and more closely resembles a series of soft, graceful slides on a toboggan than precision cornering. I'd assume that the idea there was to emphasize a rally-style drift racing not unlike that of Rallysport Challenge, since that seems to be an ongoing obsession of Sega's, but it really doesn't work right in this instance and the quality suffers because of it.One unique, surprisingly cool add-on to most of GT 2k2's races is the inclusion of a post-race replay editor and photo system. The photo editor, in particular, is something that sounds completely stupid at first but becomes extremely cool in action. After an important race on one of the career mode's circuits, the game will automatically jump right into a replay of your efforts, but rather than sitting back as a mere spectator, you're given the ability to change angles, zoom and capture up to six different in-action shots. After you've used up all of your film, you're taken to a screen to review the shots and select your favorite of the bunch, which is then displayed on the wall of your in-game garage, right above the trophy case. It's a fresh way of giving the player a sense of personal accomplishment, visually identifying your achievements with the actual act of achieving them, and is one of the few aspects of the game that's an unbridled success.Sega GT 2002's variety of differing modes for game play are conspicuously similar to those of Sony's Gran Turismo series; you've got a straight \"day in the life of\" career simulation, the standard \"try to beat my best time\" so-called arcade setup, a head-to-head competitive racer with support for a maximum of two players, and a mildly interesting storyline option dubbed \"chronicle mode.\"The career mode, officially titled \"Sega GT Mode,\" certainly aspires to be a Gran Turismo killer, but opts for a more straightforward, linear path in contrast to Turismo's famous free-form career progression. Sure, you start in the same place: a couple thousand dollars in your pocket, a dream, a knack for the track and endless amounts of free time to dedicate to your craft. The similarities, however, really end once you've chosen a bottom-of-the-line car with which to begin your journey and actually start to take part in a few races. The staggering scale of Gran Turismo's world and that game's amazing ability to project a feeling of awe directly onto the player is a big part of what makes it so highly respected, so iconic, among gamers. In the world of GT 2002, you'll buy your starter car, perhaps spend a few minutes tuning and improving its performance, and head out into a world filled with a stiflingly narrow career path and maybe one or two choices to make along the way. You won't even take your first \"license test\" until you're already three races into your career and the tests themselves are as bargain-basement as they come.Instead of slowly working your way through each important aspect of racing a high-performance automobile, (showing the judges that you know how to accurately brake, to turn without nipping some off-turf terrain, to pass without ramming your opposition into a stationary object) you drive a game-specified car around a game-specified track for one lap. If you don't finish with a time that the judges deem to be acceptable, you fail. For the purposes of license testing, you're also granted a strange sort of \"failure meter,\" which quickly drains if you nudge a wall, allow your wheels to leave the track at any point, perform a power slide around a corner or potentially turn your head the wrong way. If the meter hits empty, you guessed it, the test is over and you automatically fail. So, in addition to timing you on your run, the judges also expect you to drive like a grizzled veteran along the way, which is cute because there's no sort of training module to introduce you to the title's flipped-out physics engine. Hope you like flying blind, because Sega is here to dispense the blindfolds.While the head-to-head mode is your standard split screen affair and the \"Quick Race\" option is run of the mill, the \"Chronicle Mode\" seems to have its heart set in the right place, even if the results are less than spectacular. Aiming to fill gamers in on the history of circuit racing, as well as the trends in car manufacturing that have come and gone, \"Chronicle Mode\" asks you to climb behind the wheel of one of a dozen different '70s muscle cars and race against opposition from three historical decades. You'll work your way through the historical ranks by racing it against cars from the 70s, early 80s, late 80s, early 90s, late 90s and \"21st Century,\" observing as its early strengths are surpassed by the rapid progression of technology and toiling as the older model's inherent weaknesses become harder and harder to ignore. Before each race, the game gives you a little historical lesson in the form of a three or four paragraph essay, explaining what advances had been made in the automotive industry over the five years in question. It's a great concept, but the historical essays seem to have been written by someone with only a passing knowledge of the English language and considering the inherent flaws in the standard game itself, the last thing you're going to want to do is handicap yourself by racing an antique against a souped-up 21st century monster.As far as visuals are concerned, this isn't really a game that you're going to want to show off to friends. It's mediocre at best, topping the visuals of its immediate predecessor, Sega GT on the Dreamcast, but failing to live up to the standards established by its direct competition. The car models look oversimplified, the environments are lacking in detail and the spectators are blatantly two-dimensional, animated cardboard cutout fare. Even the pre-renders featured on the front cover of the DVD casing are sub-standard, attempting to simulate the brilliant reflections, glares and textures later accomplished by Project Gotham 2 and failing spectacularly in the process. This is a game that could've benefitted tremendously from a few additional months of focused concentration and development in the graphics department, but for whatever reason that potential was never realized and we're left to deal with yet another visually unimpressive also-ran.I know it's tough to compare a game like GT 2002 to such a well-established, universally-praised behemoth such as the epic Gran Turismo series, but by positioning itself so directly as a supposed competitor to the industry-leader, Sega leaves me little choice. It's like passing around a platter at a huge social gathering where tiny slices of two-week-old baloney sit right alongside flawlessly steamed slices of ham and gorgeous, mouth-watering hunks of turkey. When all of the good meat has been picked over, the slower-moving guests who find themselves stuck with the smelly, discount-brand baloney to snack on will be complaining. Loudly.\n",
      "These people are going to far with the shooter games. They have enough already and there ending up to be exactly the same. Sure Eidos Interactive is a great maker for games but havent they made enough shooters for xbox????\n",
      "I had heard a lot of great things about this game and was very tempted to buy it, but I decided to rent it first.  I was right, the game isn't that great.  The controls are ok, but the graphics are PS2 graphics.  Hitman 2 has a good concept, but the gameplay itself is very poor.  It's a first player perspective so if you're one to get dizzy playing first shooter games then this game is not for you.  If you're looking for a good game you'd be better off with Splinter Cell.  After playing Splinter Cell, no other games compare to it.\n",
      "IF YOU WERE BORN WITH 36 FINGERS YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME. THE KEYBOARD CONTROLS DON'T WORK AND THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL FOR THIS GAME IS OFF THE HOOK. HITMAN CONTRACTS? MAYBE AT THE 99 CENT STORE!\n",
      "Hitman seemed like it was going to be lots of fun until It took me 6 hours out of one day just to try to attempt to beat the first mission. I got it this morning and will be trading it in tomorrow. Just for the record I still have not assassinated the Don in the first mission. This game will frustrate you to the point of migraine and that's not something I'd like to endure in my leisure time. I thought video games were supposed to be fun with a bit of a challenge, not this one though, this is all challenge no fun. Dont But it unless you want a headache.\n",
      "Every year around Thanksgiving, I always get several new games for PS2. I've had faith in my magazine I subscribe to, and have managed so well in the past at getting awesome games that my bros seem to depend on me to make a good decision.  This year, I went out on the limb to buy Hitman 2, which I thought would surely make a great game as every review I've seen has been almost perfect. For the first year in my 'fantabulous game' streak, I got a terrible game.When you start out in Hitman, you get a basic (if not overly simple) tutorial on how to play the game.  It's enough to get you hyped up to play the game, but that's about as fun as the game gets.Although the game does have a unique story line, an interesting concept, and a nice list of weapons, it fails to deliver a quick paced, get in - get out feel that you'd imagine a hitman would have. The game depends far too much on the player's patience.For example, once you start in on your first mission, you feel like you can take on the world - like the perfect hitman. So, you listen to what the game all but tells you, and kill and assume the role of a helpless postman. Fair enough. But as soon as you walk to the gate and get searched by the guards, you get gunned down after they discover your sidearms. Okay...so this time you try again by leaving your weapons outside. Again, you're gunned down for letting a guard see you try to enter a room beyond the front door. Am I the only one that finds that ridiculous? After replaying the mission to death, I decided to run in guns blazing and managed to beat the first mission.Beyond just requiring your patience, the game seems to ask the impossible at times. For another example, some missions require you to find your sniper rifle and then head to a designated sniping point to make a shot. Sounds easy enough, but just getting to the location is a feat in itself. If guards see you with the rifle, they start blazing. If you try to assume the role of a guard and then try to carry a sniper rifle, they still start blazing upon seeing you. Why does it have to be this hard?Even just walking from place to place is annoying. If you run, guards will get suspicious and, you guessed it, shoot you. But if you try to walk to where you need to be, it could take hours to play one mission. The 'sneak mode' that you can enter by pressing L1 may help you to take out one guard, but you move so slow that either he'll eventually turn around and see you, or his friends will come to his aid. All this is on the EASIEST setting.Wow. I have to say I've never played a game quite this bad. The only thing this game is good for is helping you realize that life is short and you need to get off your butt and get outside.\n",
      "Being a spy is one thing, but being a hitman is another. A hitman is not a good idea for a Video Game hero. The game looks like ... as well. You kill someone and you have to hide their body so no one sees it. What about that huge blood mess you made on the ground. Oh well if anyone sees it they'll just think someone spilled their fruit punch all over the ground and forgot to wipe it up. What a stupid game. Give me a break.\n",
      "it is nothing compared to blood money and absolution, its just too difficult and too much of a headache when it comes to disguises and etc.\n",
      "Why, oh why are all the Mortal Kombat games THE SAME???  Ever since the first one, the games have repeated themselves over and over and over again.  This one is no different, with only a few new charachters and old ones that are supposed to be dead!  Kano was killed by Sonya in Trilogy, yet he's back.  Kung Lao was killed by Shao Kahn, but he's alive and kicking.  And Kenshi.... wherever the idea for him came from, it wasn't good.  How does that guy fight with blindfolds?  It's simply dumb.One more thing about every last Mortal Kombat game: WHY IS NOVICE THE LEVEL SO HARD?  Sure, it starts out easy, but gets way too hard, climaxing on Moloch.  Moloch came out of nowhere, and he is a big cheapshot, repeating moves over and over, kicking your man while he's down, etc.  The game is impossible to win, making it pointless.Another interesting thing is while it says that there is a new fighting engine, the only thing that is different is that there are 3 fighting styles, and while it isn't hard to switch styles, they are usually all the same.  Weapon mode is different, but very limited.This is just another game in a series of games that are all the same.  Save your money and don't buy this clich&eacute;.  The only different thing about this game is the way the charachters look.  What a joke.\n",
      "B-O-R-I-N-G.That pretty much says it all about this game. I've been trying to think of at least some redeeming qualities to this game for those who enjoy its premise, but sadly there are none.Sure you can design rooms and kitchens, bars, game rooms and meeting rooms, but that's about all there is to it. There's none of the snappy humor you get in other SIM games; and the customers are whiny about every detail from not buying THE most expensive sink in the public restrooms, to not being on THE most expensive chairs in the restaurant.Even the \"challenge\" levels are quite dull. It's definately not the game I was expecting. ...\n",
      "This game sucks Big Time!I have played tons of RPG's, and I never put down a game unless it absolutely deserves it and this one certainly does.As many stated already, the controls are horrible. You have to like push the up arrow key and then click the left mouse botton while trying to keep yourself in line with the enemie(s) to even stike a blow, and God forbid you have more than one enemy after you at a time.The graphics, sound and realism is nice but what good is that if you cannot fight your enemies effectively.Honestly, I think any game is better than this garbage dump.Save your cash and pass on this one.\n",
      "Where did all the great ratings come from? Did they actually play Syberia? I found this game a true yawner - over simplistic and dull. I paid 20 dollars, might as well finish it type of game. It should have been named Almost Syberia since you never actually get there without buying the sequel. I now need my own wind up key for a train to oblivian since this game drove me mad.I believe the Adventure Game developers need to quit wasting their time along with ours and come out with a real 'adventure' game. A game with great graphics, great interaction and mind boggling puzzles (without the use of hint/cheats). I'll pay the extra 10-20 dollars for it!\n",
      "I'm not sure where all these great reviews came from.  I hoped that this game would help wean me off my addiction to the Her Interactive Nancy Drew games, but it didn't even come close.  I thought that moving the character around was clunky and slow, and even when I knew there was a key or something that I needed to pick up or interact with, it took me forever to maneuver around in order to do so.  The only good thing I can say about this game is that the scenery was nice to look at.  After playing 3-4 times, I gave up entirely.\n",
      "I cannot get past the first scene because the main character moves around in real slow motion.  It's terrible. It takes her a minute to \"run\" across the room which is not very big at all.I don't know what's wrong with this game but I know it's not my computer. There are 3 different ways to install it and I've tried all 3.  I tried changing the setting and everything.  I cannot get it to play right.  I would not recommend this game.\n",
      "Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade).The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth.It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge.\n",
      "It is horibule.Do not buy it.\n",
      "the game dident work on my refurbished gamecube system i got from gamestopi love this game and disappointed i coulden't even play it :(\n",
      "In my first review I gave .hack only two stars,but after having played a couple more hours,I can honestly say that that's too good of a rating for this terrible,back-end stink of a game!I would give it zero stars but that's not an option...How many horrible things about this game can I mention?Let's see,oh yeah,your weapons and armor level up by tossing them into a pond,and depending on what the weather is like,it get's weaker or stronger...sound stupid?Wait there's more!You can only use skills(spells/special moves) if you're wearing certain weapons or armor.Levels mean nothing;no learning cool spells by leveling up the old fashoined way,all you have to do is sport the right threads!WOW!You only get a certain amount of EXP depending on how many levels the monster is stronger or weaker than you.I guess just having a set amount of EXP for each monster is just too much to ask!Let's make something even more complex even though you already have to learn 5000 diffrent rules just to play this peice of junk!Don't be fooled by thinking that this game has two worlds... this game always takes place in the online game\"the world\";the real world is just the computer desktop with that annoying music.All you do on the desktop is read pointless e-mails that tell youboring ...,and if you don't kiss every character's ... in the game they'll get mad at you and won't play with you....oh,darn!As for the whole \"illusion\" of being on an online virtual world,that's a total joke!The dungeon graphics are VERY bland and repetitive; in fact if it wasn't for the flashy cutscenes,this could easily be put on the playstation 1!Oh,and the other \"online players\" say the same three things over and over, including the ones that join your party!And as for the whole story,I just didn't care!It doesn't ever make you WANT to find out what happens next.The plot isn't gripping at all;I mean yeah,you're friend goes into a coma,but as to why he did,it's just abstract and stupid.Some ghost chic get's chased by a guy with a pink staff and then he beats your friend with it!UGH!! And you're telling me that Bandai wants to drag this out to three more sequals!?Also,controlling the camera manually gets really,really old!At first it might seems like a good idea,but you'll get a headache constantly switching the camera back and forth.It gets tiresome doing this just when walking in a dungeon,but when you've got a group of enemies that always run out of view....Lastly,the music was completely indistinct and unnoticeable; Super Mario Bros.1 had better music than this!Please rent this game before wasting your hard-earned cash on it,like I made the mistake of doing!\n",
      "Wow. I was thuroughly disappointed with this game. I feel lucky I am going to sell it to a friend for a fraction of what i paid for this.The story is spotty, the graphics are soooo 4 years ago (hehe), the gameplay is boring and repetitive and the game is so short that an introductory price to this INSTALLMENT of the whole game should be around $20. If you paid full price, for this game, and the rest in the series, I hope you have a fat bank account.With the lackluster graphics being so cheap looking, found and won items being uninteresting or not useful until you buy another game in the series, I have to say I want to WARN everyone that you do not get what you paid for.If you are one of those who are happy with this game: good. I'm not... so off to Target to buy Final Fantasy Unlimited Saga. Final Fantasy series, not that's a REAL game.Blah!\n",
      "I found this game to be one of the worst games ive ever played. Why, why is it so bad. Heres an idea, get a life. Get over the anime and stop voting 5 because you \"love\" the anime.This game is way too short. I did plenty of extra dungeons, and found this game to be so, incomplex. I traded this guy for these knives at the beggining, and I NEVER found a better weapon, too easy.Anyways, heres the problems.-Cannot change the class of character, any weapon you find that aren't dual sabers cannot be equipped ever.-The dungeons are repetitive. They use the same terrains and pots and dead bodies and stuff.-Trading system boring, its basically the only interaction you need.-People say the same thing constantly.-In total, this game has 64 characters i believe. All together, civilians and players. I got the ryu book and it told me. I honestly don't know how boring it can get then 64 characters.(like 12 of them being playable)-Boring plot, your friend goes in a coma, some chick is running around, and the game doesn't have any plot.-In order to mooch as much money as possible from the game, Bandai decided to release FOUR, F-O-U-R Games. For FIFTY dollars each. Meaning this series requires 200 bucks to be completed. Considered the first one took me 15 hours basically, Bandai could of easily fit in more, instead they want more and more money. Basically this means the game isn't even a full game. Its a PART of a game.Good things-There are so many bad things. Dungeons that look the same over and over, the same pots, dead bodies, and destructibles, and the same items. BORING-Theres no good things I can think of, its a boring game, get over the anime.\n",
      "I was excited about this game at first but found the game to be a big disappointment.  Zenasaga is a much better game.My biggest disappointment was game play.  Graphics are poor and the dungeons are plain and boring.  Bandai should take note of the game play in Kingdom Hearts.The movies, however, are well done.A fiend broke his .hack CD.  Bandai would not replace it for a small fee as other video game companies do.  They wanted the full [amount].\n",
      "The game idea has great potential, however the camera angles our disgusting to say and you spend a lot of time fighting them. The controls are slow and has so many bugs in the game that you would think it was made by amateurs. It saddens me to say since I love Tomb Raider DON'T BUY IT!!! your just going to get frustrated and fed up with it. My guess is it was a rush job by then judging from the amount of screw up in it. Save your money its not worth it!!!!!I ended up useing a cheat disk to get round all the screw ups in the game!!!!\n",
      "Hi,I am sorry to say that since tombraider was reworked,and has so many glitches,I can't play it!I don't blame Amazon.com,because all they do is sell them.\n",
      "Another boring Tomb Raider game; complete with the same goofy puzzles and blocky interface. Nothing new here, just the same old game with better graphics.As for Lara's \"big guns\", ho-hum. Kids looking to see Lara's barely covered cha-chas will not be disappointed but is that really worth the cost of this game?\n",
      "After literally months of waiting, Tomb Raider: Angel Of Darkness finally hit the shelves today.  After such a long delay, it would be fair to say that my expectations were high but not too lofty.  I try not to expect a transcendant experience as you are almost always sure to be disappointed.  I was patient, as are all Tomb Raider fans, I'm sure, and quietly counted the days to its' release.  After several hours of game play, I can safely say that this game is a total catastrophe.  From the get go, you can get a feel of the horrid controls and camera movement.  Moving Lara around is more of a chore than second nature and the camera angles are just downright annoying.  For instance, when you want to make just the tiniest of turns, the slightest nudge of the left thumb pad causes her entire body to move in the opposite direction in a 180 degree turn, rendering it difficult to do the most mundane and trival action.  In addition, you end up taking way too much time positioning Lara to do any of her limited actions (when climbing through a window, you have to position her in such a way that the camera doesn't make in the least bit obvious).  It simply ends up being irritating just to get Lara to walk in a straight line.  Which leads me to the awful camera angles.  The camera angles are SO choppy and inexcusable that you most likely will want to quit in the first five minutes.  The right thumb pad allows the player to adjust the angle but as you climb, shimmy, swim or jump, the camera will automatically jump to a different angle, rendering your manual movement completely useless.  An example would be shimmying along a wall, in which you experience another wall in the foreground.  As you manually turn the camera to whatever angle fits you best, the camera system will switch to it's own angle to avoid the wall in the foreground.  It's stupid and as a result, it never gives the player a sense of total control.  Another glaring negative is the game engine.  In a few words; it's awful.  In the beginning of the game, Lara climbs a roof which houses a few crows and shacks littered about.  As it rains, there is much to see and as a result, the game slows down to a mere crawl.  Remember all those old nintendo and playstation games that would freeze when too much was happening at once?  Well, it happens here and with a system such as PS2 and a game with such a high standard as Tomb Raider, it is unacceptable at any length.  Lastly, the graphics just aren't that hot.  They're pretty standard and the cinemas are tired and uninspired.  After hearing the developers rave on and on about how the graphics are going to be groundbreaking, you have to wonder if they are still living in 1996.In the games defense, I had expectations.  Probably higher than I realize.  But this game is crap, pure and simple.  It's shocking to think that, way back in november, they decided they wanted to 'polish' the game and thus begin the months and months of delays.  It's even scarier to think how bad it was back in november to warrant such a delay and to deliver this junk after such a long stall.  Could it be that they wanted to conincide the games release with the launch of the movie?  Me thinks so.I've only had the game for one day and I'm a little bit heart broken.  Hopefully after a few more plays I can be friends with Lara again.  But as of now, this game just sucks.\n",
      "In this day and age, are we as gamers really expected to put up with this level of crap? Possibly the biggest disappointment in the history of videogames since the Sega Saturn, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is the first next-gen outing for the intrepid Ms. Croft.Stuck in development hell for the best part of 2 years, Core and Eidos should be very, VERY ashamed of themselves for allowing such a bug-filled, poorly thought-out piece of software onto the shelves, much less a game with such a rich and popular reputation to live up to.Put simply, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is an absolute dog.First: The graphics just do not cut the mustard. Granted, the human characters in the Tomb Raider series were never graphically astounding, but here they're just badly done. Textures are pixelated and the frame rate is low. Lara's animations are smooth and her new costumes are diverting, but that's it. Characters like Bouchard and Carvier are not good enough for the PS 2, being underdetailed and very badly animated.Level design is very substandard for a TR game. And, horror of horrors, there's only one tomb, The rest of the game is like a horrible cross between Metal Gear Solid and a weak RPG, where Lara is forced to run about Parisian streets and warehouses with no real sense of raiding anything.Second: The control system is an absolute abomination. Lara is just not meant to be analog. Gone is the intuitive quad-style floor layout and now jumps and falls are impossible to judge, the upshot of which is Core have created a game which is insanely easy to beat. Lining up the camera, controlled by the right analog stick, every time you want to make a jump, is just annoying, and the collision detection is ridiculous.Third: This is such an easy game to beat. Although I should point out, you'd better get to like the phrases 'Overwrite Successful' and 'Load Successful', becuase you'll be seeing them a hell of a lot. Thanks to the ridiculous control system, Saving and Loading happens far more often than is acceptable, and when you do manage to make the jumps and climbs without the control system hampering your every move or the game crashing out (happens a lot, sound and event glitches abound) you wonder what happened to the rest of the level.A horrible, horrible game that yields no rewards, and will cause great distress to fans of the TR series, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is something we should all forget.Core, never let this happen again.\n",
      "Clunky,almost impossible controls...camera angles that refuse to correct themselves...did I mention the horrible controls? Try to move in a direction, she turns around! And what is with her constantly drawing her gun when you try to jump onto an object?Did I mention the user-UNfriendly controls?One star deserved because they finally got past the lousy polygon graphics and went with smooth texture mapping and some very nice light sourcing. By the way, the light sourcing SLOWS the game down (you'll see that right away on a rainy rooftop).Oh, and my game went black screen twice, in the first half hour and had to be restarted.Too bad I waited so long for this. I personally looked forward to a revisit to TR One and Two. Such ground-breaking games. Hope this game gets better or it goes in the shiny frisbee stack.\n",
      "The first Tomb Raider was what got me interested in the Playstation console.  Over the years they've gotten progressively better.  Then there was a long lapse between the 4th installment and now.  What in the world happened!??!This title is utterly useless.  The controls are terrible.  The camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring.  Then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless.  You choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat.  All it does is use up precious game space on the disc.  Utterly useless!!!The music, is beautiful.  But these games are known for their music.  The graphics are nice, when you can see them.  The game is way too dark.  I know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb, or cavern, but it doesn't have to be that dark to where you can't see certain objects or other nuances.I also judge a game on how I can just sit and play without reading. In this instance, I had to consult the manual because the controls weren't intuitive.  Like the auto-aim and manual aim.  Some of the \"bosses\" were so lame.  At first you think it's going to be a challenge.  But, you try and try and try, and you can't beat it.  Then you do the unthinkable.  You consult the web for a walkthrough and when you read it, it's like, \"How dumb is that!!\".  After performing the moves to kill the creature, it was really quick and not very satisifying.They include this lame \"Making of\" which is supposed to be insight on how the game was designed and what it took.  All it did was waste space on the DVD.  Who cares how you made the game.  It didn't give any special insight into the way it was created because the game itself is terrible!!Overall this game left a very bad taste in my mouth.  One that I hope will not resurface in the next installment.My recommendation is to skip this one.  If I could give it less than one star I would, but Amazon doesn't have that option.\n",
      "I rented this game and to my horror I had to use the right anologue stick to fight, that's so uncomfortable. I played it for 40 mins and took it back to Blockbuster and that's the first time I've done that with a rented game.\n",
      "Being a Blade movie fan and a PS2 geek, I was excited about purchasing this game. Unfortunatley, it fell beneath my gaming expectations. The graphics are &quot;cartoon&quot; like, the 360 degree movements start to get annoying if not dizzy, and the lack of a map will leave you directionless although their are &quot;glyphs&quot; that help occasionally to steer you in the right path but not enough of them. Those three thing that I pointed out was enough for me to wish that I had rented it before I purchased it.\n",
      "My friend recomended I get this game..ITS SOOOO SWEET!  IT'S SOOOO VIOLENT....This game is soooo stupid is what I told him.  This games story was pretty intresting at first but then it all falls down.UGH!  The graphics are horrible!  The combos are unique..One of em' I'm still trying to learn but I stoped with the game.The game is pretty violent but as Violent as I thought it would be.The game gets pretty boring after awhile and it's very dull.I'd give it 0 stars if I could...But I can't... :(Well If you wanna waster your time with the game be my guest...I'm forcing you not to play the game cause hey...I can't..what els is there to say....So go out and buy it with your own opinion.But for me...I'm gonna have to say this game sucks big time...\n",
      "You've got to rent,it's the only way to protectyourself from stupid games...And this is oneof them.\n",
      "They traded it's great gameplay for graphics;this is very evident with all the pointless un-skipable cinemas.Plus they made the characters shout their battlecries in english instead of japanese,and hearing a guy say \"yeah!\" for the 150th time gets old.I hated the fact that they introduced a concept of \"combining items to create better ones\";I've never liked this in a game cause you either end up with something really cool(with help from a guide) or you end up with something worthless.Plus you only win combining-items after a battle,instead of a powerful weapon or defensive armor/accesory.Needless to say that's all you can steal from enemies as well which completely takes all the fun out of stealing.They also did away with a free-roaming world map(in legaia 2 it has an arrow that takes you from point A to point B and back and forth....no exploring!)I felt that was unforgivable!The game also made the enemies alot harder for some reason.This is very noticable in the second area of the game when you go into the mountains.As for the traditonal ra-seru type creatures that you could summon by defeating them in battle(in legaia 1)I have no idea if they return in this installment.As far as I played I did not find them,and that was too long for me esp when you learn them in the very begining of legaia 1.I'll keep playing legaia 1,but I'll pass on legaia 2.\n",
      "The followup to one of my favorite Playstation 1 RPGs of all time, Legend of Legaia, has definitely improved upon every aspect of that game and then some. Developed by the team that made Wild Arms, Legaia 2: Duel Saga begins in a small village called Nohl where a young hero named Lang & his friends are tossed into a monster infested land where the crystal they protect(an Infinite H2O supplying Water Crystal) is stolen right from under them by a mysterious traveler named Avalon. The theft soon plunges the land into a horrible state. Bound by duty & a need to protect his village, Lang sets off into the world to get the crystal back and end the mayhem around the countryside. Needless to say- it's not as cut and dried as you think. Avalon is more dangerous than you first expect. And that's where your journey truly begins.The real star here is the games' battle system or, better known as, the Tactical Arts System. Learned through scrolls, Arts combinations, and story-based events; the different techniques can all be chained together to form bigger more powerful attacks.The massive variety of possible combos are almost endless. The battle graphics are absolutely stunning at times with all kinds of pyrotechnic special effects and whatnot.Legaia 2: Duel Saga shows alot more promise than the first game, for sure, yet there is one small thing that bothered me about the game. That being the battles or lack thereof. I spent most of my time looking for more battles to face than actually wanting to move along the story. Still, it's a small gripe and didn't take any enjoyment from the game. If the truth be known, I guess, in a sense, I appreciated the fact I could take a breather between battles. Still, it woulda been nice for them to have upped the ante of the battles just a bit.Regardless, Legaia 2: Duel Saga is still worth your time if RPGs are your thing. I loved the game & seriously hope we see a third in the series. If not for the PS3, then the PSP instead.\n",
      "NegativesOk, I'm half way through this game and I have to say that I'm not impressed.  The plot is WEAK.  The game play is linear.  And instead of making it challenging in other ways, the designers had a brain storm...Lets make 90% of the game in the dark!!!!!!  So you have to switch from flash light to gun and back again.  I have died more times in the dark shooting at where I thought the enemy was located then any other way.  The story line is so simple a 6 year old could, and might have, come up with it.  I just wish the programmers would have spent more time on the story and less on deciding what places need to be without lights.Lastly, their joking about the retail price being $79.99.  This game is barely playable and I got it as a gift.  I would feel seriously shafted if I paid $20 for this much less $80.  All in all, play Doom 2 and save yourself a bunch of money.  If you want fun, play the ID classic, Wolfenstien 3D.PositivesGraphics are good, not worth the requirements but they are good.  The sound is good as well.  I also like the fact that you can go onto the Martian terrain.  The one thing I do not like is the short amount of air that you can have.  Many people can hold their breath longer then the amount of air you have in an oxygen tank.All in all one and  stars\n",
      "UPDATE:FUN: * * * (3 stars)OVERALL: * * * (3 stars)Well, below is the review I wrote after a couple of hours of gameplay. As someone else said, it starts out slow and then the story develops. Later in the game you get couple of new guns and new \"FREAKS\" show up!-It seems someone did not pay a lot of attention to detail for the weapons. If there are 3 rounds left and i push in 5 more rounds to make total of 8 rounds..you don't need to pump the shotgun..a round is already in the muzzle. You pump the shotgun if you completely run out of rounds and feed fresh 8 rounds, now you need to pump one into the chamber before you can fire.Apparently...this is something simple and should be expected of all FPS by now. ITs little things and attention to detail that make all the difference between a 3 Star and 5 Start FPSMost importantly,This game is the most \"SCARY\" game ever. (period)----------------------------------------------Overall, this game is weak!The only good things about this game are the Graphics.The Game play is bad, same old going through levels and shooting bad guys. Same old guns that make sad sounds. You are playing the whole game is darkness...but if you need a Flash light you need to switch to Flashlight and then switch back to the weapon you were using. \"what the heck, can I not have my flash light taped to my gun\".and them, you are at a Top notch research facility (Weapons research and what not ) but there are is no Night Vision goggle's. You fire the same old guns...that ofcourse look different but are no better.Let me put it this way:Half-Life was better than this game (except the Graphics)and lets not even start comparing it with HALO, cause this game is not even close to HALO.oh and did I mention, this game has to RE-PLAY value to it.Do NOT buy this game, you'll just end up wasting your money. Wait for Half-Life2 and HALO2 to come out, I can bet they will be better than this piece of junk.\n",
      "This game is good on it's own but it's just not Doom.  If Id had stayed true to the game that made them and remade it it would have been 100 times as scary as the alien looking things in this game.  This game feels like if you went to buy a DOOM game but got Alien Resurrection with hell.  The monsters in this game aside from the zombies are terrible and look like garbage.  Np pinkies, no cacodemons, no barons( no their not), no hell-knights, no spider demons, to aracnatrons, no rooms full of monsters to blast down, the weapons again look like an Alien movie not Doom except the chainsaw,  the controls are not near as good as classic doom or quake causing the multiplayer to be pretty much useless,  id just could never get to that level of greatness again.  I mean look how how butchered the Quake series is since Quake 1.  Thankfully Id has been stopped and bought out from ruining their game series with garbage like Doom 3??, Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 4, Quake enemy territory, or Heretic  II.  Doom Knee Deep In The Dead all the way through Doom TNT/plutonium project w. Doom Legacy is all you need, the best game ever made with easy new multiplayer, bots modes and extras.  Get the Doom collectors bundle instead of this crap, way more fun going into actual Hell to fight actual demons not poorly designed aliens/mutants.\n",
      "After more Doom3 time under my belt, I started to wonder, what these guys have been doing for FOUR YEARS making this???  Were they hand painting, and editing each level down to the finest detail?  I hope not, because its so dark, few people are going to care about some nice thing here, or a nice thing there.  Doom3 is so devoid of quality story and gameplay that it has me wondering..  Every level shows something Doom3 people copied from another game, literally tons of things from various games out there - including Painkiller and Halo.Lets see some great games, and stop being a technology graphics lapdogs for ATI and Nvidia where you appear like your just trying to impress them, and not make games for gamers that are innovative, and new.Doom-3 is a poor game, does nothing new to the genre, and bores you to tears with endless waves of the same repasted levels, mobs, and pathetically weak guns.Sad.\n",
      "The graphics for Doom are the best anywhere right now (assuming you have the flashlight turned on so you can see them).  Most of the time the game is pitch black so you demons can jump out at you.  Initially the demons were frightening, then the simple A.I. became boring, then it became anoying.  The enemy is very predictable except for some of the scripted events.The flashlight was annoying because it could not be used along with weapons.  You have to lower your weapon everytime you use it. (Mods are available to fix this, but the game seems to be centered on leaving you in almost pitch black to make it frightening. Without the default flashlight set up the suprises are minimal.)I quickly found the gameplay becoming boring because it is very similar to the original Doom.  Personally I prefer more tactics in my gameplay.  Halo 2 and Half-Live 2 look better, but I look forward to the Doom engine being used on future games with better gameplay and A.I.\n",
      "Why is this game getting pushed back so far?!  At least Valve had an excuse (source code got stolen) but Activision doesn't have a leg to stand on.  I upgraded my PC when I heard about these games...now my upgrades are obsolete!!  The funniest thing is that UBI Soft came out of nowhere with FarCry and beat Valve and Activision to the punch.  This game better kick massive ass for all of these delays!!\n",
      "You like hallways?If you can answer yes to that simple question, you'll love Doom 3.  If you, like the majority of people, think hallways are really not very interesting, then you're going to absolutely hate Doom 3.  And with good reason: 90% of the game takes place in one long, dark hallway.  The major differences between levels usually consist of the difference between ramps and flat ground, or catwalks versus regular ground.  I played about 75% of the game, and I remember walking out to the surface of Mars about 3 times.  I remember about 3 levels that were not hallways.  They were short.  I am currently on level 34 out of 40, and I'm about ready to put this one away for good.Level design aside, the entire game suffers from being incredibly long and repetitive.  The same bad guys, the same boring guns, the same little hidden areas, everything (in fact, there's only one new gun in the entire game, and it's ammo is so limited you can hardly use it).  Every single time you see a dark corner, you might as well load up your chainsaw and just start walking forwards.  You could do it the proper way I suppose, by switching from flashlight to revolver and blasting, but why?  You'll run into the same 4-5 zombies and one dark-orange-demon-guy, pick up some random ammo, and wonder why you spent so much money on this damn game.Overall, one of the most disappointing games I've ever played, because the graphics, even 6 years after it's release, are pretty darn nice.  Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I have to say about it.\n",
      "D3 is looking really nice but I have to agree with vanzagar...Kingpin 2 needs the graphic enginge...I also like to add that KINGPIN is the best gangster game ever.....Why doesn't amazon have this on sale?....If some one knows please post if for me....This game has bin delayed so many times its probably not going to come out...I loved Doom 1...I was an addict to that game...I never played D2 but I can't wait for D3....Isaw the Trailer for Xbox version and that also shocked me..Cause the Graphics are just as good on the pc version!..Oh well...Hope this game comes out soon...\n",
      "I am excited about this game but when i got it today I barely could run on my P4 1.5 ghz. Turns out you have to have a hella fast computer and top of the line video card to run this game. I just don't have that kind of money to upgrade. Don't waste your money on this game if you don't have the hardware.\n",
      "I could write a three page review of what all is wrong with this game. It's terrible. I'm amazed at how bad it really is. I played Doom 1 & 2 for years when they came out and they are much better than this garbage even without any nostalgia. It's hard to find anything at all good to say about it. I guess the graphics are the best thing, but even they aren't anything all that special. Games that came out 3 years prior were at least on par with it. It has the worst sound of any fps I've ever played by far. The explosions and the sounds of the weapons are absolutely pathetic. It's not spooky at all, which I thought was supposed to be the big deal about it. Bioshock has it beat easily in every aspect. I've played it for about 10 hours and I've not died yet so I'm not angry about difficulty or anything, but it's just so boring listening to voice messages, reading in game e-mails, and the combat is terrible, just room full of surprises where you can't help but take some damage then here's some health and armor and it's on to the next room. The engine even sucks. Maneuverability is awful. Story is a predictable disaster. I can't stand this weak mess of a game anymore, I'm not curious as to what happens next in the least. Not worth $2 much less 80.\n",
      "So i went surfing for old games i might enjoy playing, never expected this to be more expensive now then when it was when released.  Good LUCK selling it for 60+ dollars.  I'm sure i can find it in some backwater store locally for a decent price 10-20 dollars.  Yeah the outrageous price annoyed me enough to post this. GL NEXT.  I've played it before at a friends, it was \"okay\" but not 60 dollars, save your money get Deadspace 2 for 9-10 dollars on amazon currently, MUCH BETTER GAME, and for 1/6th the price.  Short of that, i'll just wait until doom 3 becomes one of those \"free download games\" in a few more years, its already ancient...\n",
      "I HATE ALL SIMS GAMES!!!! Listen ppl!! The game is just incredibly boring! Whoop de doo da.. I'm having so much fun watching my Sim stare at a TV screen with a still picture on it!! O JOY!!! Get with it.. the game is plain bogus ok..if u wanna play god..I suggest another game... Trust me I've [bought] 2 expansion packs and the original Sims (and I'm 13 so u can guess that took away pretty much my whole fortune).Like other reviewers said, there is always something missing in the Sims...something that makes it just not worth your money... and no matter how many new objects, or pets, or downtown areas Maxis is gonna come up with, there will always be a hole in the Sims. And that hole won't ever be filled. Why?? Because it doesnt have an ending. It has absolutely no point whatsoever! ...I assure u you'll be ticked off at the huge amount of memory it takes up.To sum it all up..It's expensive, takes up too much space, fries ur brain, gets annoying, has no point, and is an overrated...\n",
      "I've heard so many people rave about the Sims over the past couple of years that I finally decided to break down and buy it. This is one of the few times that I have to say I honestly have no idea what the big deal is all about.The Sim is a \"people simulator\". You create little people, plop them down in a house and control thier lives. You buy them clothes, furniture, make them meet people. Just about everything real people do. And that's basically the problem.The thing I that I found least entertaining about the Sims is that the whole game revolves around what I call \"micro-managment\". Every last little detail you have to scrutinize. Though some might find this appealing, I found it tedious and boring. It makes me feel less like I'm playing a game and more like an accountant. The game is also quite slow paced. Even if you speed up time, the game can move too fast and then you can really lose control over the game.The gameplay consists of a \"point, click, and watch\" formula for gameplay. You click on an object, your Sim person will walk to it, use it, and then go back to being idle. After time if you develop a pattern the Sim person will do things on his own, but that takes a while. After endlessly pointing and clicking and watching, I started to do things like try to set my Sim person on fire, or not have him go to the bathroom for a while. It is rather fun to torture your Sim person but it wears thin after a while.The graphics are good. The Sims speak in some kind of jibberish. And there's lots of Sim skins available for download on the internet.All in all I'd have to say that I really don't get this game. Maybe it's because I'm more used to games like Metal Gear Solid and SOCOM that I have trouble playing a game of this type. I tend to like having more direct control over the outcome of a game. The Sims made me feel like I'm a spectator. I'd have to say pick this up only you find a really good deal. Otherwise it's best to take the $20 you were going to spend and pick up something else. Sorry, but this is one I can't recomend.\n",
      "The Sims was a bad idea to start off with and the fact that they have draged it on says something about the publishers and the people buying it.  I buy this game, every single expansion pack and I hate them all!  This game is so boring, so trite, so unimaginative.  This game has all the makings of a very bad game.\n",
      "Okay, I apologize for my earlier review.  For some odd reason I was reading reviews on this game and someone said to run it with a keyboard.  Well, I have a force-feedback steering wheel which worked very poorly on this game (VERY POORLY).  However, when I started using the keyboard this game was as fun as the NFS games of old.The physics model does stink in my opinion compared to Colin McRae Rally 4.0 or Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed, however it is fun.----OLD---------I have every need for speed game ever made from the original Need for Speed to Porsche Unleashed. They were all great.This game is HORRIBLE!!!  Save your money.I don't know who coded it, but to say that the physics model is bad is a GROSSSSSS understatement!!The gameplay is beyond bad, it's a travesty!I just tried it and it runs fine, it just .... horrible!!I just installed it and played it 1 hour ago.  1 hour from now it will be uninstalled.  Oh, it's so bad I feel bad even selling it.I'm going to write that it's bad in my item description just to stop people from buying it.  AHHH!! run!!\n",
      "Trust me when I say this game is weak. I don't know what all the 4 and 5 star ratings are about for this game. If you are under 15, maybe this game is interesting. BUT if you have played MOH or COD, Counter Strike, Raven Shield...then this game will seem very lame and silly to you.The missions are uninspired, recycled garbage. The game engine, graphics and the game AI are HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!It is no fun when you are trying to shoot enemy troops and your soldiers just walk right in front of you and stop or just ignore the troops shooting at them from 3 feet away or when they constantly shoot into a wall because an enemy soldier is hiding behind it(funny how they cannot figure out how to kill an enemy 2 feet away in the open but they can see through walls!!) Believe me when I say your squad mates will constantly get in your way and block your path !!!!At the VERY LEAST - either download a demo or borrow a copy from a friend and test drive this yourself before spending $30 or more on this garbage.NovaLogic used to make some decent games back when I had a 386 DX2 with a 210MB hard drive and Windows 3.1, and even then the game AI was so-so. NovaLogic has not changed a bitSkip this and spend your money on the games that are really going to knock your socks off.\n",
      "If you happen to own one of the new ATI cards, the game wont work. So I gave it 1 star because EA sports should have fixed an issue like this before releasing a game.My system:Pentium 4 running Windows XP with an ATI 9700 PRO. It restarts the system every time I try to run the game.I am disappointed because the game we release only a couple of days ago, and the ATI cards have been in the market for more than 3 months already, and it just doesn't run with it.I cannot comment on anything game specific. I just wanted to warn people out there with new graphic cards.\n",
      "There are yellow sparks that come out whenever i plug this in an outlet. It also messes up the tv image. The only way to safely use this power adapter is to hook it up to a surge protector, it is best to buy the official nintendo brand adapter. It is worth spending the extra few bucks to avoid any electrical fires.\n",
      "Avoid this dog-pile... Look, lots of people like lots of different things. I HATE THIS GAME. I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. The graphics are crappy, the game play is utterly repetitive. Did these jokers spend any time designing this product? You will need to be a real die-hard fan type of person to enjoy this more than a few minutes. You cannot turn into the flying mode at will. That sucks. And the graphics look like a kid's coloring book. Get yourself a used copy of \"Mechassault\" or even \"Battle Engine Aquila\" & you'll be better off.\n",
      "I was a diehard Robotech fan as a kid. This game did a lot to ruin that for me.The game itself is glitchy; for example, when a character talks their picture appears on the bottom third of the screen with the text of what they said. Sometimes this stays there, blocking out both the text and audio of future messages (which sometime contain mission objectives and, yes, you fail the mission if you do't complete them in a timely manner, even if you never got the darn message) as well as a good portion of the gameplay screen.One of the great things about the show were the massive battles with dozens of fighters from each side in a free-for-all. In the game it's usually you versus the world, with maybe one or two allies (but only sometimes, if you're lucky), and you're usually stuck defending a helpless transport that has no sort of evasive AI and will usually fly smack into the middle of an enemy formation even when there are a dozen other less-suicidal routes to take.There are also invisible boundaries and ceilings in most of the levels, and if you hit them while in fighter mode you will come to a screeching halt and automatically go to humanoid mode - a bad prospect when you are being pursued by half a dozen enemies, which is more times than not the case. These boundaries sometimes occur in places that don't make any sense - like in a valley linking two playable areas.As for the non-gameplay elements, the original English voice actors were brought back, which is nice, but they also voice characters just like those that they played. This leads to several confusing audio exchanges where two supposedly unique characters have the same exact voice.I went into this game with high expectations, and it ended up being one of, if not the, worst games I've ever played. Now when I see it for sale in the discount rack for under three bucks, I know exactly why.\n",
      "They don't tell you that the game will not play on a MAC, EVEN if the disc says its compatible.\n",
      "I was very disappointed in this game.  It looked like a fun game where you walk around in a mirror, look for keys solve puzzles and maybe use magic but no.  Instead there's a little hand on the screen that you move around.  All you do is click on stuff.  I thought you would control mickey.  I mean who the heck thought of the stupid hand clicking.  This is not how the game should have been.  Every time you do something it shows like a 2 minute movie.  DONT BUY THIS GAME.  Save your money for good games like smash bros,  Resident evil series, mario sunshine, something good.\n",
      "I can't believe this game was released. Normally a game like Mickey Mouse I would think would be fun at ANY age! I love disney movies and such. This was painful. It looks like on the box, you use Mickey to walk around and gather coins. Instead you have a hand that you point everywhere. It takes getting used to and that's even questionable. Gets boring FAST. I can't imagine a child figuring this out. Neat story poor execution. I think if you could control Mickey without the pointy finger curser it'd be a lot better!His little &#34;hmmm&#34; every 3 secs gets old and annoying. It's the only thing he really says other then an &#34;okay!&#34;  Glad I didn't pay much!\n",
      "Seansp, time out... kids wont like that word, you got to be kidding me. Anyway anyone who says this game is for children and bought and were not happy,is obvius we are talking about Mickey Mouse Game not resident evil... so if you dont like silly, stupid, easy games dont buy this one.... PROXIMO!\n",
      "I bought this game for my 5 year old triplets.  The cursor doesn't always respond well, and is very frustrating.  The games \"childrens mode\" is actually more frustrating than the normal mode, as it doesn't have the hint icon.  The game occasionally plays a cartoon for up to 5 minutes that you cannot move past until it finishes, which frustrated my kids and myself to no end.  The childrens mode sometimes moves automatically, and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again.  The \"ghost\" terrifies my kids.  We all strongly dislike this game, very very frustrating on all levels.  A total waste of $40.\n",
      "The only thing good about this game is the Texans and the Seahawks new uniforms. Donavan McNabb couldn't complete a pass against the COWBOYS! So embarrasing. There are better things like night games in seasons or the hand warmer, but I'd rather waste my 50 bucks on a Seahawks game. It is pretty much impossible!!!!! DO NOT BUY NFL FEVER 2003!!! STICK WITH NFL FEVER 2002!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I just got these about a month ago and they will not work at all, the playstation will not recognize them? I don't know what kind of junk they are making now because I had an old sony that worked for years? Too late to send them back now too.\n",
      "I love the Spyro series. My favorite was Spyro Year of the Dragon which was perfect. When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me.For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands. I would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of, but given the bad recession this series has had lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.\n",
      "When I heard a new spyro game was out, I happily rented it. When I entered it into my PS2, I quickly noticed that this game was not made by Insomniac (My favorite video game creators.) I assumed that I may still like this game. Well, I was 100% wrong! Why? 1) They have Ripto return after you defeated him in the first game. 2) Graphics that make it look like the worlds are made of paper, and 3) The glitches. I then thought, The perfect spyro series has been ruined. So, instead of buying this awful, and stupid game, play the PS1 spyro games. Sadly, this is the worst game I have ever and always will be, other than any PS2 spyro game. Bye.\n",
      "This game is one of the worst games that I have ever tried. When my friend went to his hometown for the weekend, he lent me the ps2, lending me GTA VC and Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly. GTA was pretty good, i dont see whats so great about it but... spyro is just horrible!!! The other spyro games make it seem like you are free jumping into the air and feel like an actual flying thing. This is so annoying it feels like you are controlling an elephant... seriously! He jumps and [waddles] down onto the ground. The abilities are really stupid, and the plot is just plain sh*tty. I mean, come on, this game doesnt take more than 6 hours to completely unlock EVERYTHING and thats if you want to waste money and time on this crap. It's disgusting.. with jumping limited (he can jump like 2 inches) I've attempted to jump up to a platform, which makes me fall 90% of the time, then i have to climb 5 other platforms to get back to it. And when you run into a wall or object it rumbles and gives you a feeling that a slow, stupid elephant has ran into a wall and gotten hurt. I would never buy this game, you have to unfreeze dragons, which look like a bigger, fatter, even stupider (if you can imagine possible) spyro that gives you a bunch of coins. The loading times are just HORRIBLE! I had to wait like 15 minutes for the game to get to the title screen, then another half hour getting through all the stupid cut-scenes and loading times to actually PLAY this game. This game is a COMPLETE waste of money and it will be disappointing for all spyro's fans.Bottom line: If you buy this game you will definately be disappointed, if u like it, get it, but im warning you the game gets VERY annoying in all aspects, and now that ive tried it out there is NO way I am EVER getting this.\n",
      "AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS GAME MIGHT BE COOL  BUT IT WAS A HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT FIRST OFF IT WAS TO SHORT .SECOND ITS NOT FUN ITS REALLY BORING AND ITS REALLY SLOW WHILE LOADING DO NOT BUY THIS GET YEAR OF THE DRAGON INSTED .WORST SPYRO GAME EVER CREATED\n",
      "I've said it before and I'll say it again, Universal Vivendi ruined this series for me.  This game is better than the one I have for the Wii but not by much.  There's only one world to explore and like a previous reviewer said, the level portals aren't named so that is a bit of a pain.  Yes you do have to collect something other than gems in this one as in previous Spyro titles but mine froze quite a bit (probably got one of the earlier copies released) and the load time was annoying.  I'm used to the PS games taking time to load but this one took forever!  I could've gone and made a five course meal in the time it took.  Okay so I'm exaggerating but as I recall the first 3 Spyro titles had quicker load times.  Either way, even though it's been almost six years since I bought this game, I'm still disappointed with it.\n",
      "This Spyro game had everyone excited, but when it finally came out, it sucked. The game looks great and it has new features, but that doesn't make up for all the problems with it. It's gameplay is slow, and the storyline is for a 5 year old. With this game, Spyro lost all his attitude. In my point of view, the developers didn't even try on this one.\n",
      "It it not worth a penny!I'm a huge Spyro fan, when it came in the mail of course I was excited, but that quickly changed!There are only 9 levels. It take SOOO LONG to load! it loads the loading! I can't play it without finding a glitch. One time I ran past a seagull in the beach level and the sound of it chirping stuck then the sound of underwater stuck on top of that and it sounded like nothing I've ever heard before! I had to shut it off because it wouldn't stop, I even reset it!The characters look DUMB like there is no bone in their body or brain in their skull. (if they had one) they look too jello like, and the voices don't match their mouth.When you attack an enemy you can't tell that you made s successful hit till it dissapears. In the old games the controller would jump and you would hear and see the impact of Spyros head, so you KNOW you hit him. And when you charge a sheep it burns into lamb chops... Sorry I though that only happend with fire?  They ruined the sheep, they are all fat and slow, instead of quick and springy.Over all the ONLY thing that I found nice in the game was the graphics, it is beautiful.Without Insomniac Spyro will never be the same.\n",
      "I am a big Spyro fan, and I bought this right when it came out and was bummed out. I seriously wouldn't recommend this game. If you've never played any Spyro games I'd recommend the 1st 3. They are REALLY awesome :) but this ps2 game is boring, and the graphics pretty much suck. It gets me dizzy just playing it b/c the camera shakes at times. If you still want to play this game, (in my opinion) you should probably rent it.\n",
      "&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2 is more sneaky than Splinter Cell! Splinter Cell is just about the graphics! In Metal Gear Solid 2, you get to sit through three hours of cutscenes and try to comprehend the screwed up storyline they throw in your face! When you get to play, you'll see how short the game really is, how idiotic the bosses are, and how better it is than Splinter Cell!&quot; This is what I usually hear from people who don't like Splinter Cell. This could have been a good game if they didn't try to make a movie out of it, but sadly, that's exactly what they did. The storyline is terrible. The conversations you have to listen to are sappy and boring. There didn't really need to be a character change in the game. You switch from Solid Snake to Raven(Why?). I would be better off playing as Solid Snake, but you have to switch for some reason. You fight most of the bosses in the 2nd portion while playing as Raven, and the bosses are pathetic. There's a Storm-like boss with a big lightning gun, a vampire with swords who happens to be in love with the boss with the lightning gun, a fat bomb carrying boss, and a boss who reminds me of Dr. Octopus. There is a corny plot for each of them, and I don't want to sit through them again because they're so stupid. The game's plot gets more bizzare as it goes on. I'm not going to expain what they are because it's too much. The last thing I'm going to say is: Splinter Cell is 10 times better. The graphics are good, the storyline is more realistic, and it actually feels like a stealth game. I get mad when people yell at me for not liking Metal Gear Solid 2. I read that even the guy who owns Konami thinks Metal Gear Solid 2 is stupid and that the original is better, which is probably true. Go cry now, MSG2 fans.\n",
      "This game sucks! I played it with my dad about 2 years ago and we had to sit through the flippin tutorial for like 5 hours!!! We quit after a half an hour and we never played it again. The main problems are:1. It's nothing like yugioh2. You have to sit through the tutorial for 48 hours3. The controls don't make any sense4. It's more like dungeon dice monstersDon't buy this at all\n",
      "If you are going to go out and buy a yu gi oh game, this sohlud be the last one on your list. It is terrible, bad storyline, dueling system is horrible, and you'll get tired of it after 10 minutes. Yu gi oh Forbidden memories, on the other hand, never gets old. You will enjoy that game much more than this one.\n",
      "Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelists of the Roses should have been great. The series is amazingly popular and the card game can be quite fun. Somehow, Konami managed to ruin a game despite the odds.First, this PS2 game takes the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! and transplants it into the middle ages, with the War of the Roses. The houses of Lancaster and York are vying for the throne of England, and only cards can settle it.OK, I don't mind that. I love English history, and I also enjoy card games. So into the tutorial we head. While they go over every step in the game, it's one gigantically long rush of about 1/2 hour or more. And instead of letting you practice the commands and repeat them, it's a slideshow-like sequence where you just keep hitting X ... X ... X. You really need a walkthrough to print out to have it all available and ignore their slideshow.Finally you get to the game. You choose a default deck and take it into \"battle\" as you try to move across England. Problem 1 - there's no practice! You go from that slideshow right into a nasty battle that many find difficult to win. You are often dealt awful cards that even skilled players find it hard to win with. It's hard to learn the game when your monsters are stomped easily left and right.At least you might have pretty things to look at and listen to while you die, right? Wrong! The graphics for the cards are awful. You can barely tell what element something is or anything else. Even the important numbers are hard to decipher. And for sound, you get the same droning loop of synth music again and again.Cardplay is new and unusual, with monsters moving across the board and facing each other on different terrain types. It's sort of interesting but can be extremely frustrating, especially for new players. You do get a semi-cool 3d \"quick battle\" when the cards meet, but even that is on a boring background and lasts maybe 5 seconds.Perhaps worth it for the incredibly-dedicated Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, but the rest of us should demand something better next time. This game is an embarassment given the quality of PS2 games coming out today.\n",
      "What a snoozefest! Whenever a game review includes \"Fun for the whole family\", that is always a good warning sign. Most of these Blockbuster-movie based games are usually pretty lame but this one is actually playable; this is probably why people are gushing all over it. It does not mean that it is good, no way! Harry Potter is just a well polished, slapped together, cash-in quick game. Parents will be forced to buy it, so it will automatically generate alot of cash. It really does'nt need mine.\n",
      "Firstly, I have the PC version. The PS2 bit on the description has thrown me a bit!That aside, I loved Simcity 3000. Played it for hours. Heard about SC4, got it, unwrapped it.... and.....Well it looks nice. Has a bundle of extras that 3000 didn't have. So I dived in to the rich graphics and started building my city. CRASH.Frozen computer. Hmm. The read-me's said ensure you have the latest drivers for your soundcards, graphics cards etc... so off I went... spent about 3 weeks upgrading drivers, playing the game for a bit... watching it crash, trying another driver.... watching it crash...So I contacted the admitedly very responsive EA tech support via email. We spent about a week trying different things to a point where it worked ok in VERY slow software mode. At this point EA told me how I could get a refund.Not impressed.All my computer specs exceed those printed on the case. I'm also a bit of a PC geek, so following the read-me instructions, tech support advice and upgrading drivers wasn't a problem. So why am I left with a very nice looking but unstable game?I have now got it working with medium detail settings rather than the full glory I should be able to see, but after several weeks of constant crashing, I can't face playing it again. I fear the next crash!(Yes, I have tried EA's first issued patch for SC4. No it doesn't help).\n",
      "This game wasn't good at all! Maybe if it wouldn't crash so much I would have loved it. Did they put it out too early or something? This game truly isn't good. OR fun. Okay, I play the regular sims like HD(hotdate) and SS(superstar) and so on, and maybe I'm just comparing them. But I didn't like Simcity 4. I thought it would be great. And my mom and dad wasted $50.00 on this stupid game! And we couldn't get a refund! What a waste of money. I wouldn't risk buying this game! It kept freezing!! And I got bored with it right when we just got the game. So, you'll get bored easily. Very easily. boring!\n",
      "If you buy this game please be warned that it is very bad.If you think this game will offer you the action packed thrills of GTA or anything along that line please reconsider.  I play a lot of games and I know video games.\n",
      "i loved playing sim city 3000 unlimited and couldnt wait for sim city 4 but as with the sims, ea has made it so complicated that it was not fun at all. I have played all the sim games and am trully disappointed that they have taken the fun out of the games.\n",
      "This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its \"owners\" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a \"cash cow\" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or \"crash to desktop\" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain \"habits\" in the play methodology.If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed \"Simcity 4 Deluxe\" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive nowSimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack.This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the \"networks\" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of \"transportation\" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game \"stubs\" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so \"support sites\" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a \"strategy\" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't \"an answer\" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single \"regional development\" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running \"game support\" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.SimCity 4 Deluxe Editionor the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games includedThe SimCity BoxI have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it. The downloadable versions should be \"pre-patched\".Be VERY CAUTIOUS buying a used version from eBay, etc as you MUST have the registration membership in the EA/Maxis web site to update the game with it's patches.. only buy if you can get this membership with its User Name and Password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered... many people have been burned on this matter Even buying \"new\" versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report \"already in use\" even though you \"bought it\" as \"new\". Get the seller to guarantee the version is register-ableSorry to be so long-winded, but I felt most of this needed to be touched upon. In whatever form you buy it, I recommend immediately taking a look at web sites which have active communities interested in the game. You can happily invest many hundreds of interesting hours in the game if you're willing to invest the time.\n",
      "I enjoyed the Simcity games and felt ripped off with Simcity 3000 as it was basically the same package as the previous Simcity.  If you love the basic city building concepts of the Simcity games, Simcity 4 is the exact same thing.  At least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for today's video cards but if you look at screenshots for Simcity 4 you'll see that it has the same rules, building types, etc.  If you'd like to play Simcity again with an updated graphics engine, go for this title, but if you've been \"simcitied out,\" save your money and buy another title.  Sims anything sells like hotcakes and EA realizes this.  It's another attempt to cash in on the Sim name.\n",
      "Why not to buy:Game is very slowAfter playing for a while, the game actually freezesBuggy as all get outTook out many great features in previous gamesThe graphics AREN'T better!  You have to turn all the graphics options DOWN COMPLETELY in order to get the game to run on your computer.MAXIS/EA bombed this one, DON'T BUY IT!!!\n",
      "Oh God, how I hate this game!What's most important in this game: the combos you have to make and it NEVER works!!!??Maybe it's because I'm left-handed and I do not have enough control, power and speed in my right hand (fingers), but I suspect it has to do with Gamecube's controller with this particular game.  (The Gamecube controller I actually like very much, there isn't a single game that gives me problems for being a left-handed gamer, the c-stick for instance, an annoyance for many people,  I handle pretty well)This game did ruin my good mood completely.Not only do you have to push the right combinations, but it also has to be done in a certain fashion: rhythm and timing must be 100 percent accurate or else you fail and fail over and over again.Good lord, what a terrible waste of time this game is.Well obviously it isn't any fun for me, but I can imagine that with a different controller (PS II or XBox) it'll be more comfortable. Still, any game that depends heavily (not to say completely on swift and acrobatic fingerworks suck big time!\n",
      "this game is so horrible. the graphics are bad, the fighters are boring, and i think this game doesn't have fatalities!\n",
      "Trying to target the dragons in this game was increadibly frustrating. Could not get past the dragons in level three. Complete garbage, no fun what so ever. Would not even recommend renting this game.\n",
      "I'm so glad I rented this game instead of buying it. Animal Crossing is cute but completely pointless. It's a little like &quot;The Sims&quot; in that you have a character and a house in a virtual world; but unlike &quot;The Sims,&quot; there are no relationships, and it's not even much fun decorating the house (it's only one tiny room).I got bored after about 90 minutes; I could tell the game was going to be nothing more than running repetitive errands for the residents of the little town.I truly don't understand why anyone likes this kind of game. This is just as bad as &quot;The Sims Online&quot; (another boring, pointless real-time game).\n",
      "What do I say?No point, nothing fun to do(except pick weeds), and the music drives me crazy.Dont get it, not worth it.Dont even borrow it from a friend. Personally, you couldnt pay me to play this game(unless youre you willing to pay...then we'll talk)\n",
      "I hoped that this game was fun, seeing on all the reviews and stuff, but it's not. This game needs like this expansion, to make it more,supposedly fun, don't buy it!\n",
      "I put this game in my Game Cube for about ten minutes and had to remove it.  My friend came over and wanted to see why I said it was like torture to play that game and he realized it as I stared away from the screen while it was being played.  I considered snapping this game in two and flushing it down my toilet, but that might be too good for it.  This game is much worse than games that are so boring or easy that you sleep while you play through them.  It is indeed torturous because of the noises that the animals make while they talk, so that you cannot sleep through the game while you play it.  The answer to this problem is simply do not play it.  Fortunately, I bought it used and it sits in my collection, but is not played.  I bought it because so many critics gave it excellent reviews, but the critics can and quite often are wrong about games.  I may give it another chance someday, but not anytime soon.  Hey Nintendo, I have a great idea for a spin-off of this game.  The spin-off would be called The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction of Animal Crossing, in which the Hulk has to go around and smash the animals of Animal Crossing and their surroundings.  And the Hulk would have all the incentive he needs as soon as he would see and hear the annoying talking of these animals and their annoying behaviors.  Hulk smash, good Hulk.  Nintendo, at least consider a spin-off called Batman Vengeance on Animal Crossing, in which Batman uses all his Bat Weapons/Arsenal/Utilities and his stealth abilities to take vengeance on the animals of Animal Crossing.  On a positive note for Animal Crossing, it might be potentially liked by children that like to play house, but it would probably be better for children to play house the old-fashioned way with their friends.\n",

      "Don't buy Thunder.  It's not a bad game, just that you can better spend your money on NASCAR HEAT: Dirt to Daytona.  Thunder only offers stock car racing whereas Heat offers *4* games in 1: Dirt/Go-Kart(modifieds)/Truck/Car and therefore Heat offers a lot more variety and fun.  Buy NASCAR HEAT: Dirt to Daytona instead.\n",
      "...I feel robbed just renting it! This game is miserable in so many ways I don't know where to begin. As the race started, the first thing I noticed was, the frame rate is about 15-20 frames per second(the average is 30, a good-decent game is 60 frames per second. Heck, most racer games can generate 60 fps). There is NO excuse for this horrible frame rate. It looks more like pictures flashing in front of the screen! It's so choppy that I never felt like I was racing, just watching a bad cartoon. The SECOND thing I noticed was the graphics are pitiful. This game is NOT worthy to be on the XBOX(... the XBOX is capable of much more and I expect it!)...\n",
      "Cheap Chinese POS don't buy this knock off, the thumb sticks squeak loudly and it weighs 11oz less then the real one. I tore this apart after it broke in 2 weeks and nothing was salvageable.

First off I had problems with sound (I have sb live plat 5.1) so if it doesn't work well for sound blaster what does it work well for. The graphics are okay, but being as how the gameplay is LAME and the quests you get are lame.. do not buy this. They took a good story and went off in the wrong direction. I ended up returning this after giving it a decent chance (even with the sound problems)\n",
      "This was a gift and I finally got around to installing it.  Or I should say tried.  I tried to run it on a laptop and 3 computers but the game will not start.  Just a black screen.The one thing to be aware of is the fact that your monitor card has to be texture and lighting compliant.  My nvidia quardo fx 1400 from some reason will not work.Also, note that Black Isle is dead and Vivendi has a not that they will no longer support this game.Do not buy it.If I ever get it running I will come back and change this review.\n",
      "This game is incredibly shallow and boring.  By the time they had me looking for mushrooms I turned the game off and used the disk as a frisbee.  Save your money and get Two Towers instead.\n",
      "Reviewed on a 1GHz, PIII with ATI Rage Pro 128, 256M RAM.This is a joke, right? We're not seriously expected to pay for this program which would have been considered unimpressive five years ago. The graphics are mundane, the character movement is crude and awkward, it doesn't play full-screen (it's always in a window). The cut scenes are played by 3rd rate amateur hacks with video/audio synchronization like a dubbed martial-arts movie. The third person view constantly blocks the objects your looking for and you can't change the view to be more overhead.The graphics are so crude the program should run smoothly on a 333MHz box but its really sluggish on my 1GHz. What's it doing with all the cpu time? Looking for extraterrestrial intelligence? If Tolkein were alive this dross wouldn't bear the name of the Lord of the Rings!I expect more from Vivendi - much more!\n",
      "Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them \"limited\" accounts (a recommended \"best practice\" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to \"user-level\" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game.Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Age of Mythology is a good game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation...\n",
      "While I understand that franchise games tend to lean on their franchise as a crutch, even despite the cutscenes from the movie this game is virtually devoid of story. The fact that you can't skip the poorly-done game cinematics doesn't help the poor presentation, and while the series is supposed to be grand, this ends up 'walk forward and kill things'. The fact that the Fellowship will follow and help sometimes but not others feels untrue to the movies and book.Story: 3/10I'm not the kind of person to demand photo-realism or exact replication - I still enjoy playingChrono Cross- but this game was truly unimpressive. It's not 'gasp, it's Dong Zhuo!' ugly, but it's disappointing.Graphics: 5/10At least the sound effects do all the right stealing. The movies sound pretty good, and the game sounds fair. Music and in-game sound-effect volume can be altered independently, but the ambiance lacks a certain polish that I expected from the movies the game is based off.Sound: 6/10While the music is indeed stolen from the movies, what shows in the game is toned down background material. WhileThe Lord of the Rings The Third Agemay not have been the most innovative RPG, at least it sounded and looked nice throughout.Music: 5.8/10This is repetitive action requiring complex combos for unimpressive-looking moves, along a narrow path that offers none of the free exploration of the wide, impressive lands of the movies. Your ability to upgrade your character is based on how skilled (lucky) you are in the level, because you can't replay and this means that if you have a bad run, your only option is to reset the game and load all over again. None of the skills really seem to change gameplay that much, as an RPG this game falls flat on its face and as a hack-and-slash it makesDynasty Warriors 4look great (it's not). The local co-op consists of the middle six levels where a friend can follow you along the narrow, short levels, but isn't nearly as easy to get into as good co-op games where you can generally have a friend help from the start.Gameplay: 4/10You don't even get the option to play co-op until after you've already spent at least a half-hour beating the first two levels, and then you have to save and quit to the main menu to discover that levels can't be repeated. What? You didn't have a lucky run with Gimli and you're too short for that one minimally helpful upgrade? Start all over. The fact that the first two levels can only be played with one fixed character and all but one of the rest are locked to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli don't help. There are extras you automatically unlock by progressing through the missions, but unlike The Third Age there's little good organization or sense of true satisfaction.Replayability: 1/10With the large number of five-star reviews, I had high expectations, and perhaps that was part of the problem. Everything it tries to do has already been done better elsewhere, and while I'm not going to say this game was horrible, it was short and lackluster - barring getting stuck on a level, you can finish in one sitting of just a few hours (though boring load times and unskippable cutscenes don't help). If you want a good Lord of the Rings RPG,The Lord of the Rings The Third Ageis superb compared to this. If you want hack-and-slash, look for a different franchise. I wouldn't even suggest a rental, but do that before you consider buying, even for bargain-bin prices.Overall: 3.7/10\n",
      "The main problem I have with this game is the stupid camera.  I'm not generally a big fan of the 3rd person games (unless they're side-scrollers or top-down), esp. when you're expected to aim at something, but this one really stinks it up because the camera angle is not consistent since they're trying to make it look cinematic.  If you run back a little to regroup (e.g. in Fangorn Forest), due to \"artistic\" changes in camera angle, you may find yourself surrounded and unable to even see the character you're controlling.  This \"game\" was made to be looked at, not played.  If you want to fight and use cool combos, try Tekken Tag.  If you want to shoot at things, go with Timesplitters 2, Silent Scope, or a Bond game.  If you want a medieval fantasy fighting game, try Dark Alliance.  If you want to watch a movie, watch a movie.\n",
      "wat were they thinking when they made this game i would have more fun watching the clothes in a laundry machine go up and down\n",

      "The Sims games are just crap. They are so boring. All you do is control peoples lives. All they do is go to the bathroom, sleep and stand in one spot for hours. I cant see why people like this game. Save your money and buy another game. It took me 20 minutes to get used to the controls and by then I wanted to trow it out. I never liked the sims but I thought this sims would be a ok game. I was wrong. The grafics are good but that doesnt make the game funner.\n",
      "First of all, I tried this game, and I do not think this is a great one to get.

Other than that, stick to the complete PC collection.\n",
      "People will say whatever companies want them to, but not me.  What the companies don't want you to hear about Splinter Cell is it's horrible story line, it's lack of options, and the atari style graphics that fill this game.  I am a computer gamer, I play more games than anyone and I know games better.  Trust me.\n",
      "i originall said that this game was an excellent game, but after playing the xbox version and the playstation 2 demo, i now know that this computer version is the gayest thing that can ever happen to the personal computer.  i have to say that the only good thing about this game is that it is challenging, but in between the game jumping around with you graphics settings and the fact that the controls are kind of messed up, this is in actual fact a terrible game for the computer, because of the fact that it probably wont run as well as you want it to.\n",
      "I'm sick of mario party titles.  The first one was fun, the second one was weak, but still good, and from there on the series hit rock bottom and dragged it's way across it.  It may entertain someone who's never played the series, but everyone else will be dead sick of it.  Mario party should have stayed Mario Party, and there shouldn't have been any sequels.  Obviously Nintendo's in this franchise for the money and only the money.\n",
      "This game was addictive to me for a while, but it got real old FAST.  The storyline is stupid, I mean really, who wants to work their back off trying to get presents for YOUR birthday?!  Also, the game way too easy, and the game is a repeat of Mario Party 3.  No new character and character voices, it's once again just a bunch of annoying squeaking animals.  In addition, there are only 6 boards in total, and they are so plain.  This game seriously needs to take advantage of the Gamecube features.  Apparently, Hudson and Nintendo are still living in the Nintendo 64 era.  The only thing OK about the game is the graphics.  Beside that, it's a waste of money.  Don't get it, I warn you, you'll want your money back very soon after purchase!  You can also see my review on Mario Party 5 if you visit that page.\n",

It is so linear that it's boring and illogical (you can't leave the hotel without first finding certain items in your own room -- what sense does THAT make?)Plus, the movement is tedious and repetitive. You end up going around in circles trying to figure out what the game wants you to do next (not what makes any sense).I managed about one hour's game time before I uninstalled it. Well, that's an hour of my life I'll never get back!On the plus side, it installed -- and uninstalled -- without a glitch. Big deal.\n",
      "I'm so frustrated I don't know where to begin. I bought Half Life 2 expecting an outstanding gaming experience. What I got was hours of frustration trying to figure out how to make it boot up. In all my years of gaming, I simply needed to double-click the desktop icon and away I went. But some genius there at Valve decided to make the most convoluted, invasive and frustrating interface ever conceived in the world of gaming!!! Can I simply click the Half Life 2 icon for the GAME I PAID FOR and play? NOOOOOOO! I have to go through some online nonsense called Steam. One day I click the icon and I have the option to play in \"offline mode\"; the next day I can't play because Steam won't let me. What were these people thinking!? I have uninstalled the game and have loaded up an old copy of GTA Vice City...now there's a game!Sincerely frustrated,KA StoneKernville, CA\n",
      "To run Half-Life, you have to install an interface and create an account with an on-line service called Steam, even if all you want to do is play off-line.  An internet connection is required -- as it says on the box -- not for gameplay, but for registration.Unfortunately, the game ships with no documentation except a cheat sheet of in-game commands.  The Steam interface doesn't have any on-line or context sensitive help.  Its operation is not intuitive, and it doesn't appear to work very well.I'm sure Half-Life is spectacular -- according to all reviews -- but I haven't been playing Half-Life.  For the last 24 hours, I've been playing Steam, which is much less fun.You might say that the rating of one star should not be for Half-Life, but unfortunately, Valve made the decision to go with Steam and therefore gets full credit for a frustrating experience and perhaps a complete waste of $50 (?)  Depends on whether I can get this to work before I get tired of playing Steam: Off-Line Mode.\n",
      "Five Stars for the game fun factor if you can eventually get it loaded and bugless but unfortunately really deserves the one star overall because of the horrible, horrible installation requirements and because of many awful installation specific bugs that grossly interfere with game play.The game itself truly is excellent, with the graphics, game play, controls all setting new standards. I personally don't like the plot and setting as much as the first Half Life and find it unnecessarily dark and depressing and I thought the ending was a little abrupt and unsatisfying, but in comparison with Doom 3 it is really a fun romp. Truly a great game.As to the really bad part. I am a computer programmer and have half a dozen assorted computers. I spent 16 hours trying to get a working install on My new XPS with PCI express buss and 256mb ATI ultra video board. The Steam On line install system is a mess!!!! First it insists on installing Steam, then an update (over one hour on Dial up), then decrypting another hour plus. then registering and the list goes on. Then when it's done it doesn't work. I get a disk not installed message. So OK go to steam and planet half life web site and look at bug FAQs I find one that tells me if I get this message I need to uninstall my Sonic DVD driver and reinstall Half Life 2. I don't really want to remove my Sonic Driver, but I do and way and spend another four hours reinstalling Half Life. This time, up comes the starting half life 2 message, but half life 2 never comes up either on or off line. So I go back and look at the rest of the FAQs, all 170 of them, NONE of which cover my problem. I try one more remove and reinstall of Half Life 2- four more hours. Same result. Finally give up and go and install it on my old Dell Inspiron Lap top four more hours. Works perfectly Play game in standard mode and works perfectly. But wait there's more. On a hunch I try a remove and reinstall one more time on my XPS system four more hours, this time removing Steam as well as Half Life 2 first and it works fine and I play it through on Hard mode and it is HARD. You'd think I'd be done now, but no there's more. I though I'd play the redone Half Life Source through on hard mode since I'd only originally done it in standard mode and it should have been all installed when I installed Half Life 2 right, wrong , three more hours installing Half Life Source and it works, well, sort of. Each time you start the game it works fine for the first ten or fifteen minutes, then it starts taking little fifteen second breaks (picture and sound freeze) every minute or two. After another ten minutes or so, the breaks stretch to 30 seconds and after another ten or fifteen minutes they stretch to 45 seconds, eventually reach more time frozen than playing (within an hour of starting each time. I sort of recall from the FAQs that there is a fix dealing with this that is accomplished by disabling the advanced stereo features of your sound card and you guessed it reloading all of Half Life 2 and Source from scratch again, but some how that wasn't too appealing to me any more so I played it through in hard mode as it was freezes and all. Half Life Source is still low poly but appears to be substantially improved over the original Half Life and is really quite hard in Hard mode.Last level Half Life Source strategy. For the Nihilanth, go into the level with your rocket launcher armed and take out the 3 crystals on the wall before you are dumped to the ground then immediately run behind the spiky rock nearest the wall and snipe at fatheads head and brain till he dies. In hard mode getting hit with the white balls is equivalent to instant death and the green ball sends you to a really unfriendly space avoid them both at all costs. Skip the jump onto the ledge thing in this version.The games are both great, but Valve has made such an utter hash of the installation procedure and of leaving in totally unacceptable bugs that they should be boiled in oil or stuck in with their own Nihilanth. They have made this mess because of getting their code ripped off last year and are making their paying customers now pay for their own stupidity then. I would really like to see a Half Life 3, but at this point, I would really prefer to see Valve go broke instead.A final thought is skip the limited edition, it is truly not worth it. The supplied Prima Guide is a joke only covering the entry to the game and is really an add for Prima guides I wouldn't use one anyway and the supplied shirt is uninteresting in the extreme. The DVD ROM Version is the only thing of value that is supplied and it isnt worth thirty bucks more than the CD version.\n",
      "The game is top notch--no complaints there.  My gripe is dealing with Steam.  Yeah it took a long time to download (several hours) and register with Steam.  All was fine for many months until I foolishly let Steam update it's files while I tried to start the game while still connected to the Internet (I just do single player, no multi for me).  The Steam update (which I suspect I didn't have to have) totally screwed up my game.  It won't let me play now.  I can't access the game at all.  I've tried a myriad a way to figure out this puzzle.  Be cautious of this game unless you are a total geekmeister.  I do OK, but I'm no geekmeister.  After numerous emails and FAQ searches with Steam, I gave up and haven't played since my ability to do so was STOLEN by Steam--which really means a Steaming pile of poo!\n",
      "I just got the game and to my surprise, even though it's a single player game, I HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE NET TO PLAY IT !!Not only that, but the game converts all your old Valve games to the new technology, so you also can't play them anymore unless you're connected.Now I don't know which website this is, but can you imagine the scene?  You and 50 million kids all wanna play this game on Saturday morning.  What do you think the chances are?  Particularly if you have a dial-up.I'm returning the game unplayed.  No way am I paying $55 for a game and don't really own it.  Very stiff rental fee.  I'll buy no more Valve/Steam products.\n",
      "Though I never originally purchased a Half life game, now I definitely won't.  You people on here are pathetic!  Only fanboys of Valve would tollerate whatever the company does.  \"Praise the Company!\"  Your blood is boiling as you read this?  GOOOD!  I hope so.  I like people mad at me.  Because instead of knocking this review you should be knocking the aa h at Valve and Steam. If your not, then I hope you rupture a splean and get a stroke from this review.  You are a waist of human tissue and material that could be used to make other babies.  When the people at CGW who are rude in general start pansy-ing up to the Valve people like Newel then something is indeed wrong.  Jeff Green can insult his costumers but we know he wouldn't dare knock the all-mighty-valve.  What a woosie!  Let me explain something to you PC layman types.  WIndows XP Has an activation process...  OKay I don't like it but you only do it once!  Half Life, Half Life II and all other accompying games require you to be online not only during activation but when PLAYING the game(single included).  YOu have to continually PROVE you own the game.  How Hitler is that?  Neverwinter Nights is trying this with thier fan based mods but they have also lost a customer as I only play the Trilogy and don't buy into mods that require connection all the time when it is unnessasary.  ALSO.  Weather you  like it or not, your credit card is charged without prior knowledge and once you activate Steam, they can charge you(legally) for anything at anytime.  So you had best know what your getting into before purchasing the game whether boxed or downloaded it's the same.  You should be spanked for saying Kudo's to such a greed bunch of paranoid overly protective jerks like valve and thier partners.  Thats the news and I am outta here!\n",
      "You must register online before you can even play offline.This is ludicrous.This is also a very disturbing trend for a game - if you buy this one, you can expect to see more games use a similar scheme.What happens once you uninstall the game and it is no longer even supported years doen the road?  You are out of luck.  They could just as easily decide to stop supporting it once the next version is out and force you to upgrade.Stop the madness now before it gets out of hand or we will all come to regret it and pc gaming will be choked out of existence.\n",
      "I found the first \"Half Life\" and the following two expansion packs interesting to play, but the degree of violence rampant throughout the series was a constant hamper to their overall enjoyment. In many portions the action went beyond \"realistic\" into ridiculously gruesome. The game would have been just as good without all the extra blood and guts. The storyline, action, adventure, and game engine were what made the original \"Half Life\" an exceptional gaming experience, not the extreme violence.Sad to say, \"Half Life 2\" picks up where the original version left on and dramatically pumps up the level of objectionable content. To be quite honest, I'm surprised no one else here has picked up on this. The content is pure trash. Instead of thriving on level design or even story, the game relies heavily on the shock value of gruesome violence. So severe is the level of such content that you have to wonder if the designers intentionally crafted it to be purely sadistic. Let's be realistic about this, folks. Over-the-top violence is not cool. It's not innovative. It's not for \"mature audience only.\" It's time we realized mature people don't go in for such filth.Granted, the \"Half Life 2\" physics engine is incredibly well designed, but that alone is hardly reason to plunk down $50 for the game. A few months down the road, all first-person style games will have the same advancements, and many of these won't contain such sordid content. Personally, I'll be investing my money in games that provide great graphics, challenge, and gripping storylines, but do not contain such objectionable content. Look around. There are plenty of such games available. Why waste your money on pure filth?I hate to think what kind of damage this game is doing to impressionable young kids, who are undoubtedly its biggest market right now. And its affect is not reserved just for children. No adult human being with an intelligence quotient above room temperature could continually expose him or herself to such content without being negatively affected. It might not manifest itself in actual violence, but the influence on our minds and souls will still be there. Sure, we all know it's fake, but if we continually allow sordid images into our minds we will inevitably be desensitized to them altogether. We will find it more and more difficult to practice such traits as compassion and self-discipline in real life.The safest bet: Avoid this game altogether. There are countless other titles, including those in the first-person shooter genre, that provide the same benefits as \"Half Life 2.\" It's about time we told the game industry enough is enough. Use your money wisely and avoid this trash.\n",
      "If you buy this used you will have to send the CD and all packaging INTACT back to Valve for replacement due to CD key being registered to only one user. It will cost $10.00 and take 6 to 8 weeks.The instructions at Valve say that if you buy it used then ALL the packaging has to be sent back. How often do you receive all the original packaging when you buy something?I just bought a used copy, and found that Valve's registration system was a ripoff. rather than dump this game on another unsuspecting idiot I have thrown it away.\n",
      "Though i am sure this is a good game i may never know thanks to this aweful little devil called STEAM! this program is clearly a violation of privacy as it hijacks your Pc in the attemps to keep the game from being pirated. In doing so it alienates all of the good people out there just wanting to play the game of the year. It is such a buggy program that all of a sudden i cannot even put in a half life Cd without my Pc freezing up requiring a restart. I will never purchase any product containing STEAM and anyone who does is asking for trouble. I warned ya!! thank me later!!! Thanks STEAM/VALVE,,i will spend my money on products not associated with you.\n",
      "As some reveiwers have already mentioned, Half-Life 2 requires registration on a program called Steam. Well, to make a long story short, I've spent my entire day salivating over a mere taste of the game I just forked over $55 to play, but instead of battling aliens in City 17, I'm battling network problems that Valve should have anticipated... but that's absurd because I want the single player campaign, and my internet connection (etc etc) shouldn't even be an issue.Most games average $39.99 new, but no, Valve demanded $55 (as did Doom 3 and Diablo 2 and all those overhyped \"we're doing you a favor letting you buy this masterpiece at all\" games), and to add insult to injury I can't even play what I paid good money for. I don't know what the game is like, so I can't judge it -- but I can vent my frustration, as others have done (and are doing in increasing numbers), by informing potential buyers of all the pains that come with owning Half-Life 2. You shouldn't have to jump hoops when you've already paid, and to say I'm \"steamed\" (forgive the pun) is quite an understatement.I'm showing Valve how much I appreciate this mess by selling my copy of Half-Life 2 and turning my back on it. I don't care how great PC Gamer thinks it is -- my principles of a consumer demand it.\n",
      "Well, if you read the reviews you will see it all spelled out for you.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  You can't even play it.  You need a high-speed, always on connection in order to play this title (unless you want to wait for 4 hours on dial-up).  The heck with that trash, I spent $55 on this title - and I need Steam's permission each time I want to play it? Where was that on the box? Also not on the box is the fact that you have to wait in line for your turn to get permission - yes, this from the same company that had its source code hacked, so you can just imagine how reliable their servers are.  Apparently there is a way to play the game offline, but it doesn't work for everyone, and some people are being told by Steam/Valve that they have to disable their LAN's - no way!Note to anyone that hasn't opened the box - DON'T.  Unopened you can return it easily.  You open it and returning it is an entirely different ball game.So tell everyone that you can to stay away from this game, maybe when the dust settles they will release a patch that revokes the necessary Steam membership.  If not, well, the only thing I can suggest to people who want to \"play\" the game they paid for, look for someone who is sharing a hack online.  For once I think the pirates are justified - and that sickens me.\n",
      "To begin with, this game made me extremely dizzy and nauseous. I have been playing pc games for many, many years and I have never had a game to do that to me. I had to quit playing for a while just not to literally throw up. There is so much quick spinning around to check for enemies and maybe it's the game engine too, but this game made me literally sick. The game itself is also very linear and scripted. You just follow along shooting at enemies until the next cutscene. Also, there are MANY load screens everywhere! And, the world of Half Life 2 is very depressing. I wouldn't want play it again to return to that world at all.Next and the worst part of this game is:STEAM!!!!You have to be connected to the internet at all times to install the game and even play it in Single Player mode. I will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement. STEAM can also load any software it wants to onto your computer. How does that sound? That's what you agree to when you install the game after a long, arduous process.And, you can't resell the game if you ever want to due to registering your computer with the ID# that comes with the game. Now I have a game that I don't ever want to play. It comes on 5 Cds so I guess that's 5 coasters I can place around my house.\n",
      "I loved the first Half-Life, and this one looks pretty awesome, but unfortunately it is marred by what could possibly be one of the worst installation procedures ever devised.  You need to register online for the single-player game!  What a pain. If you buy this be prepared to spend hours installling it.  Really, really lame.\n",
      "Not a comment on the substance of the game, but just a note of caution to buyers:  even though this is an \"offline\" game, you need to be connected to the internet to play the game, in any mode.Why?Because the creators/publishers are paranoid about piracy --- so the game discs you are buying do not contain all the files needed to play the game.  In order to get these needed files, you need to download them from the creator's website on the internet.  On launch day, this was taking 4-8 hours to do.  In addition, after the files are downloaded, you need to register the game at the website before it will allow you to play it when you are not connected to the internet -- and that registration line can be long and slow!  And this is for the OFFLINE portion of the game, not the multiplayer portion.The retail box apparently says \"internet connection required\".  They mean this folks -- NOT just for multiplayer!  You need to set aside several internet-connected hours in order to download the remaining files and register the game before you can play one second of it offline.Booo!  Hiss!  The creators and publishers here are putting their own paranoid security above the ability of gamers to play their offline games in peace, without having to deal with the lag associated with online games.  Poor show indeed, Valve and Vivendi, poor show!\n",
      "I have had a horrible experience with this game.  I hate Valve now, and will not buy another game from this company.  I have wasted a whole day trying to play this game.  There are several problems.  1) Tremendous load time.  It took nearly an hour to load (AFTER the installation process was over).  2) STEAM (may the company rot in hell) is required in order to play the game.  You have to register with them before you can play HALF LIFE 2.  By the way, they also took over my original HALF LIFE game.  I can't play that one now either even though this morning before installing HL2 I had no problems.  My system is a Pentium 4 1.6 Gigahertz system with 512 Megs of Ram and oodles of hard drive space.  I have a killer All In Wonder video card.  That's well within the minimum specs of this game, but the darn thing seems to choke on HL2.  Please, save your money and time and get another game.  I wish that I had.Upate:  12-16-05:  Everything I said above still stands.  That's how much I dislike this game.  Please, buy FEAR instead.\n",
      "I tried installing HL2 for 6 hours before I finally gave up. I kept getting \"Error 1305: Cannot read hard drive\" messages. After following the instructions on the Valve Support page (of which there are precious few), and doing ridiculous things like updating my DVD-ROM bios at their request, it still wouldn't work.I finally looked online and found that a score of others are having the same problem. The answer: Faulty disks! The media Valve used to distribute the game is horrible, some of it getting corrupted between release and my time of purchase (less than 15 days!)I had to return the CDs for replacements, and then the game installed the first time. Oh, by the way, if you have dial-up (thanks to living in a rural area), installation will take at least 90 minutes. You have to install Steam--a ridiculous program that is the ultimate Digital Rights Management kick in the neck--(5 minutes), install the game (15-20 minutes with CD swapping on 5 CDs!), let Steam update itself (10-20 minutes), register for a Steam account (10 minutes), register your game with your Steam account (15-20 minutes), and then allow Steam to \"decrypt\" your game so it's playable (20-45 minutes).After all that, it STILL takes more than 90 seconds just to get to the game's main menu when you run it! I had Commodore 64 games in the late 80's that loaded faster than that. To to it all off, with this new \"innovation\" in game installation (read: annoying ploy to destroy our souls to keep someone's 13-year-old cousin from burning his own copy), there are NO DIRECTIONS, NO GAME MANUAL, no nothing! There's a \"reference card\" to help with install, which says nothing of what Steam actually is or will do to your machine (it resides in the system tray and eats resources  even when you're not playing?!)For a game that was so severely delayed, this is not just disappointing-this is unconscionable design. There are as many pages of advertising for ATI video cards as there are instructions. By the way, forget about tech support. I emailed them 3 DAYS AGO, and have heard nothing back. Of course, you can try \"live tech chat.\" Good luck with that, if you can even get connected. No telephone support, and no contact info for support on the ridiculous card that's not even a manual. There's no game manual even on the CD, from what I can find!For those who say you can't rate a game based on its install and interface, I have to disagree. In fact, I think it is inane to think otherwise. How can you rate a car that's nearly impossible to get into? Sure, it might drive great, but if you can't actually squeeze through the door to get in, what use is all that speed?\n",
      "That's pretty much it.  I can't run my brandnew game because it requires broadband and I didn't know it.\n",
      "I will wait until all the bugs are ironed out on this game. I had trouble even running the demo so I gave up. It is NOT my systems fault either. I have a current system with current specs so the programers have NOT done a good job.\n",
      "It's unpatriotic.I know what you're saying; \"What the... are you crazy?  Unpatriotic?\"  Yes, I said unpatriotic.The original Half Life was set in the middle of the American mid-west, at a deep underground US government facility.  This latest game is set somewhere in Europe, and gives us a multi-ethnic love interest.  The love interest isn't bad in and of itself, and it really doesn't matter what race she is, so put your racist accusations away.  What I'm getting at is the fact that all of the game's contents are marketed not as an American product, but as one for a \"global community\".To me that's a stab in the back.  It's subversive with good intentions, but still underhanded, and dilutes everything for which my nation created and stood for.  Let Gordon be Gordon, and let the game's love interest be whatever race, creed or nationality the can be.  Just put the damn thing back in the US of A.What does this have to do with Half Life 2?  Well, how come we don't see US Special Forces trying to interfere again?  Suddenly the \"G-Man\" isn't some US secret service agent, but just some mysterious jerk.  Suddenly the American flag isn't posted anywhere.  Suddenly we're not in the US anymore, but in some European setting?What the hell?In an attempt to make commercial art viable for international markets, national identities and ethnicities are stripped.  Note how Gordon Freeman went from being a white MIT grad to a ambiguously ethnic scientist.  Again, put your racist label away, because what I'm wondering is why if there's such a concern over making this game marketable, why tinker with the game's foundations?The graphics are sexy, as is the sound, and the story, for what it is, is okay.  But I still don't like it.  I want the Gordon Freeman and facility I bought in the late 90's brought back to life.  It's not going to happen.  It never will.  The G-# of nations have built their new social dynamic, and, unfortunately, it means pirating American culture and thought, and giving it to the world.And that's why I don't like Half Life 2.\n",
      "It's been a few years since I played this \"masterpiece\" but I remember it well.Half Life 2 is a sci-fi/first person shooter that follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman. And by adventures I mean, shooting stuff and being denied information about what's going on by everyone. Of course you can infer a vague aliens took over the planet plot in the first 2 minutes, and the inference is about all you'll ever know. Cliche ridden sci-fi ambience aside, the real problem with Half Life 2 isn't the monsters in game but the monsters in the programming.You see, when it came out there was a bug that seemed to randomly hit people. The bug caused stuttering with sound and hitches in gameplay, even on high end machines. The bug STILL exists and shows up in Source licensed games. I can only be confounded at how a development studio which as much money as they have can't make a stable game. id can do it. Crytek can do it and beat the pants off everyone else's technology. What's up with Valve? Aside from the infamous stutter bug, there are the load times that don't make any sense. Load times that are as if you're defragging your entire HD each time, it takes so long. How do you play a game under such maddening intermissions taking you out of the action? This is a problem that also has NOT been fixed despite Valve's ability to update their game. Add in the sloppy jalopy that is Steam, a piece of software you are forced to run to play their games, and I am utterly fed up with Valve's software practices. They just aren't up to par.The last point I would like to bring up is the level design of HL2 was a joke. It was linear. As in, well a straight line of gameplay. It's almost shocking, like, am I playing Star Fox? Am I playing a 2D scrolling shooter for the NES? Why on Earth would they take the ability to make open 3D designs, and make every level a linear walk to point A,B,C... ugh, some of the worst shooter levels I've seen, although the office areas of F.E.A.R. trump it I guess. The thing is, Far Cry came out before Half Life 2, and you know what? It was wonderfully open ended. Sure you had to complete the objectives, but you weren't in a little of tube of gameplay with no other choices. Valve seemed to have gone backwards gameplay-wise, like another bigshot that crashed, id with Doom 3, they could not capitalize on the things that make gameplay great and so the game was just a hollow tribute to lots of money spent on art and self worship.That said, I think Valve is very gradually trying to overcome the criticisms levied at them. It's not happening overnight, but I wonder, maybe we'll see a Half Life 3 that makes everyone happy and not just those who like their games dead simple.\n",
      "bought game through amazon marketplace. sealed and new, with no manual and no key code. be careful.\n",
      "Half Life 2 is possibly the best game ever made. This game is truly a work of art. The graphics are gorgeous, the story is compelling, the environment and physics are superb, but the whole game is RUINED by the steam log-on process.After you install the game you have to log on to a Steam server to unlock it. This takes 30 mins - 1 hour. I don't mind this if it keeps people from illegally copying the game. Here's the bad part, every single time you want to play the game you have to logon to the Steam servers. TO PLAY A SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU HAVE TO LOG ON TO A FREAKING SERVER. This is ridiculous. With millions and millions of people trying to play the game every night it can take forever to log on.....if you ever get on.Don't buy this game. Save yourself the money and time because you won't be able to get on the Steam Servers.\n",
      "I just spent over an hour installing this game on my dial up modem which uses the most insane installation process I have ever seen.  There is no booklet included in the box.  There is only one cheap card which tells you that you can play offline if you check the \"remember my password\" box, except there is no \"remember my password\" box to check anywhere during the installation process. So when I tried to play the game I was told that I would have to wait 136 minutes, and I presume that was online.  These people are so paranoid that somebody might rip them off that they have devised an installation scheme which is unbelieveable.  But if they want to rip me off, well that's another matter altogether.  I regard Valve and Sierra as thieves and criminals.  I uninstalled their garbage from my PC and will have it in the garbage can tomorrow.  I will never buy anything else from these crooks.\n",
      "While shopping, browsing or whatever on some Internet site, the site told you to make your PC wide-open to it, to grant it supreme access to do whatever it wants to do, wheneverit wants to. What would you think? What would you do? Well, that's what it takes to install and run Half Life2.You might do the above to allow Microsoft LiveUpdate to patch your PC or Norton to upgrade your Anti-Virus software but a game site? Be warned to play this game you just about have to sell your soul to Valve and Steam. After loading the 5 software disks, you will be spending the next 1 to 8 hours (based on my and friends experience) creating a Steam account and having Steam set up hl2 - if you can. While this is all going on, your PC is sending God know what back to Steam and Steam is returning the favor to your PC. All this so you can finally play the game that you paid big $$$ for.Here's some helpful hints from Steam and Steam forums to fix what is obviously your problem - you need to open ports.....through your firewall, you need to disable Norton Script Blocking, you need to grant Steam \"GOD\" rights to your PC, Anti-Virus software? Obviously that's the problem. Turn it off! These are being presented like they are your problems or Norton's or Zone Alarm.  Worse, gamers are complaining how horrid it is that Norton should cause them all this trouble! Does anyone besides me see something terribly wrong here?Do yourself favor - pass on this one. It's a good game but not a great game and certainly not good enough to warrant the trouble and risk you are going to take. You may be doing others a favor too. If the Half Life / Steam way of doing business becomes prevelant, PC Gaming is doomed. I absolutely will never purchase another game that forces me to go through all this again and expose my PC to the risk. If every game company starts doing this, I'm done with PC games. It's back to reading and music. I might even pay some attention to the wife who gets little now because I play too many PC games!One last comment - I assume that all the folks giving Half Life2 4-5 stars are either 12 year kids or are completely computer illiterate or are gamming zombies who will put up with almost anything to play hl2. If your none of these, I can't say little enough about you. If I tried, Amazon probably wouldn't publish this. Any adult who bought this game and attempts to install it, will realize they have been had and try to get their money back if they can...............Uninstalling Steam..............Uninstalling HalfLife2\n",
      "I received a copy of Half Life 2 for Christmas. I have been waiting for this game to be released for two years. Yep, we have all been through the \"our ideas were stolen...yada...yada...yada...\" I was appalled to discover that in order to load the game, I had to sign up for an account on-line!!!! Sure, they \"SAID\" you could play the game off-line once you signed up BUT what kind of \"stronged arm robbery\" is this!?! You HAVE to sign up for their on-line crap that you DO NOT want OR need?!?! Valve AND Sierra should be hung and quartered for this blatant ripping off of the public. Now...IF you can swallow all that BS and decide to try the game for all its hipe, you will quickly discover that Sierra and Valve released the game on FIVE CD'S!!!! Who on God's green earth puts out a game as a multi-swap CD anymore?!?! One darn DVD would have handled the complete game. Okay, so you play the CD swap only to find out that their is a crucial file missing at the end of the 4th CD. Oh, did I mention the craptacular box AND no manual?!?!I did not bother to return the game. I threw it in the trash where it, and all other games like it, belong. It is a shame that I never got to experience any of the game itself. Maybe the companies will release a non rip off version on DVD, that actually loads AND that has a hard copy of the manual!You know, there was a time when Sierra games were to die for...KIng's Quest series...Phantasmagoria, etc...BUT no more :( [...]\n",
      "I waited and waited and waited and waited for the game to be on the store shelves. Finally no more delays and I got my over fifty dollar version. Okay. It's gonna be a great game . That's what I have read  it was and after so many delays it had to be considering its predecessors. Five disks to install. kind of like shades of XIII.Don't get a nice thick jewel case however. Got it all installed and then I had to activate it. I can see  their reason why. No problem I thought to myself. I said that  and after an hour activating and decrypting files I'm still not ready to play the game.Think I'll just take it out and put a nice easy to install  ,no fuss,no mess game in and put my long waited for and beautiful copy of HL2 in a closet where I can't see how much money I wasted.\n",
      "I have no idea how this game is getting so much hype!!!! i mean its not even that good.Pros-Good graphics but not the best-Some unique weapons (e.g. gravity gun)-Midly interesting storyCons-STEAM You have to DOWNLOAD AFTER THE LAST CD FOR LIKE AN HOUR! then whenever you play the single player you are linked to the internet.  Now this is a problem because it can leave some computers vulnerable.-Ending was very bad-WAY TOO LINEAR!  I felt like i was being forced to do stuff by a \"higher power\"-Whenever i was  it felt very unconvincing and i couldnt get into this game at allOverall this game is bad and defiantely not worth the hype it has gotten from so many peopleI would suggest buying Quake 4 (if you have a good enough graphics card for it)\n",
      "All the reviews bitching and moaning about Steam? They're spot-on.  Steam simply ruined this game for me.  It was HOURS from the time I unwrapped the box to the time when I could actually PLAY it.  And the trouble never stopped. For weeks I stubbornly kept playing, in spite of system freezes, interminable delays between maps, and frustration with one of the damn dune buggies, which was terribly difficult to drive because the graphics kept jumping and stuttering (in spite of my pretty decent system, well above minimum requirements).  And all this for the single-player game?!?!I would say that I was playing the game maybe 50% of the time I spent trying to play it.  The other 50% was spent waiting for a map to load, waiting for Steam to authenticate me, and rebooting my damn PC every damn time the game brought it to a screeching, frozen halt.And then one day, I had an epiphany.  The game play was pretty good. The puzzles were pretty good. I really liked that gravity gun.  But it just wasn't worth the hassle.  And it certainly wasn't worth relinquishing control of my system to that invasive Steam app. So I stopped playing.  I uninstalled it. And I never looked back.  I've not even been tempted this year to reinstall it and see if maybe some of the early bugs have been worked out.I'd give the game away or sell it, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone with whom I'm on speaking terms -- or even an unwitting stranger.  And I will NEVER, EVER buy another game that uses Steam or its ilk.  I was shocked when I installed the game to see what kind of control I had to hand over to Steam in order to run the single-player game.  I crossed my fingers, ignored my instincts, and let it run anyway.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  What a terrible precedent to set in the PC software world.  I won't succumb again.\n",
      "Half-Life 2 is a great game, no doubt about that.  But Steam just about ruins it.  Steam tells you when you can play or not.  Steam will attach itself to your computer like a virus, update when it feels like it, and decide to crash when it feels like it.  All I'm trying to do is play the single player campaign for a game that I paid $55 bucks for.  But this is the 4th time this week that I'm unable to play, because the servers on Steam's side (nothing wrong with MY OWN COMPUTER) decided to choke and I can't play.  If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.  How they paired the greatest game with the worst idea ever to hit the gaming community, I don't know.  Their explanation:  Stop piracy? What, at the cost of \"legitimate\" customers like me that actually go out and buy the game?  Now more people who actually bought the game are looking for hacked version just so they can play the game they already paid for.  Sounds like a farce to me.  Do yourself a favor and boycott all Steam products lest it become a standard for the future gaming, which would be a total nightmare...\n",
      "Right off the bat I've never, EVER, heard of this game at all!  What's up with that?  After playing the original, which is great(back in 98), I was so ready to get that sequal.  Who can deny the chaos that's going to come when it comes out?! I'm not sure if it will suceed over the original but who knows?  I'll tell you... only Valve knows these answers and their keeping it as a suprise.  I HATE SUPRISES!!! Oh sure they've gave out hints and treats but that isn't enough for an enthusiest like me!  So... if anyone knows, TRUELY knows, when this game is coming please tell me!  I've got to know if it will work on my computer.\n",

      "Utterly disappointing... And this from a chap who gave Microsoft's FS 2004, FS 2002 and Combat Flight Sim 2 - 5 stars respectively.  The box notes claim that &quot;Combat Flight Sim 3 was built using an entirely new graphics engine&quot;, if this is truly the case (and there's no reason for me to dismiss this statement as a bold faced lie) then my next burning question would be... \"For the love of God, why?!\"  Although I love to fly (simulated that is) I have to admit I am first and foremost a graphics geek, so my eyes tend to bend that way immediately and on first inspection of CFS 3 I was struck by the lack of  \"pop\" CFS 3 offers visually, sure the aircraft skins are top notch, but beyond that the textures are flat, the sky looks as if someone simply scattered a handful of cottons balls over a blue field, the menus look like something pulled off the shelves way back in the mid 90's (remember those days) matter of fact CFS 1 was a stellar achievement compared to the milk toast drabness of Microsoft's latest \"combat\" outing.  And oh yes did I mention the panels, cockpits and pathetic gunner views of the fighters and bombers are so dated visually that I thought at first glance my graphics settings were on low?  NOTE ON MY SPECS (for reference): Compaq Presario 8000T, Pentium 4 - 3.20E GHz processor, Windows XP Home Edition, 1 GB DDR / PC3200 Ram, 160GB 7200 rpm Seagate Barracuda hard drive, 16X max. DVD-ROM Drive, 256MB DDR ATI Radeon 9600 (Direct X 9), Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (needless to say I had the offender in question maxed out!).  The poor visuals inside these buckets of bolts only compound an even greater problem... playability or flyability (are those real words?).  The heads-up targeting display is arranged at such an awkward angle that training your sights on the enemy is like navigating a high-wire on the tip of your tong, you can't see where you're going and trying to think ahead of your enemy's AI is near impossible because you can't see him and the oldest trick in the book of leading your target simply doesn't apply here because your forced to blindly spray a line of bullets somewhere into space in a direction you think or hope your quarry might be headed!  I could go on and on but I simply don't have the mental strength or enough negative adjectives to describe the horror that is found inside such a pretty box.  Hopes were high, then crushed by nothing short of an amateur offering by an industry giant.  It makes me wonder, does the design team responsible for this flagrant act of shoddy craftsmanship still have jobs at Microsoft and if so are they wearing gray uniforms and carrying buckets and mops?  Microsoft should be nothing short of embarrassed by CFS 3, it's a tremendous set back for the true innovator of flight sim technology.  Look out Microsoft UbiSoft's on your six with IL2: Forgotten Battles (which looks better, runs better and feels better), they've got four gold stars stenciled neatly on their fuselage and they're looking to make that five.\n",
      "My son bought this game and complained to me that it didn't seem to work right, he is 9.  Well what can I say, as a linux user.First, this game does not adhere to the system requirements that are listed on the box...!  In fact, after installing all the fixes it comes nowhere near MS's early FS games.Second, I suspect it has serious memory leaks in it which cause your virtual memory to sky rocket after a few missions and hours of play.  You have to shut everything down on your computer if you run XP.Third, I have witness my son pitching his aircraft into a dive and the plane goes straight down from 5K feet into the ground even though he isn't going that fast and is pulling back on the stick.Fourth, as with everything MS, it loads slow, goes from one part of the game to another slow, and learns slow.The only good thing are the clouds and some of the musik, which never stops, probably intended for you to forget how slow the thing is running.Another piece of MS crap!  Don't waste your money like we did...\n",

      "As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase \"save the princess\" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight.I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard \"get to know you\" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat.That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm.I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway.I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himsef, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook.Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose.Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight.The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away.\n",
      "how bad this game really is.  The controls are absolutely horrible.  I was unbelievably upset that I actually spent $4 to rent this awful garbage.  The only good thing about this game was the many different characters and different types of matches you could play.  It nowhere near makes up for the lack of a decent control system.  The people who made this game need to take lessons off the old WWF games for the N64, because this one is horrid.  Don't waste your time or money, people.  Please!!\n",

      "Sorry all but I am about to step on a ton of Nintendo lovers with this brief review about the travesty known as Metroid Prime. If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????Uggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving. So far my experience with the WII has been pretty bad. Should have just stuck with my PS3...\n",

      "I had the Sorcerer's Stone for the PC and it was excellent then I played Chamber of Secrets for the PC and it was okay but very easy (except the broom flying challenges). I was hoping the GC version was better. Wrong...the playability is horrible. It is hard to get the camera angle to see what is in front of Harry and who wants to try to jump from one object to the next at an angle? The camera likes to show the front of Harry most of the time, so when you try to turn around to see where you are going, you usually end up getting hit by something. That is the hardest part of the game. Otherwise a two year old could play this and it could be won in about 15 minutes. Very irritating. If you've played the PC version of any of these games and are thinking of getting them for the GC - don't. All the fun stuff is gone. You will be greatly disappointed.\n",

      "When I first bought this game, I thought it would be great. Well, it was the first time I played, of course. The poor aspects of the game are countless. If you jump from two feet high you will lose about 1/6 of your health. When jumping from ledges(which appears way too many times in this game) you will fall off if you are an inch off course, making most obsticles difficult and tedius. Also, the bosses are extremely easy...the game gets everything in relation to the book wrong. They completely leave out Dobby, the beginning of the story with the Dursleys, the writing on the wall, and Gildroy Lockhart being a fraud. Also, when Harry is viewing Tom Riddle's diary, he watches the scene in which Hagrid is expelled as if in a small T.V. They also make things that were fascinating is the book combletely dull by making them bosses. Also, the general plot of the game is brought up like a what-should-I-do-today concept. The game is also very short. My cousin beat it in a mere two days. Now, I'm not trashing Nintendo, I am completley faithful and want them to suceed, (even though Warner Brothers made this ...) but, for your own good, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!

      "The premise of the game sounded great- a GBA version of LOTR. Just what I needed to relive the fun of the movie. Sure, there were a few glitches here & there, but initially I had a fun playing it. Plus it came with little cards of the characters, which was neat.Then came the big glitch. The glitch that made it impossible for me to continue playing. The glitch that froze up my game. At one point during the game, about 2/3 of the way through, I tried entering a new area. Evidently the game decided that I should've finished something else first, so it completely froze up- making further gameplay impossible. Since some parts of the game were incredibly frustrating due to glitches that made it very hard to complete, I just lost interest in trying to re-play to get to that spot in the game. I traded it in, only to discover that I wasn't the only one who was having this trouble.This could've been far better done. This was just a shoddily made game that was thrown together at the last minute. Save your money & don't even get this.\n",

      "Bad.  Very bad.  Slow as the books, without any of the interesting dialogue or plot development...instead, one is treated to the wild thrills and spills of wandering about collecting items for hours and being subjected to horribly done RPG battles.  It takes over an hour to get OUT of the Shire--and what do you do in that time?  Meandering at approximately 0.3 mph through dull, washed-out backgrounds, collecting tools for gardeners and seeds and fruits.  Whee.  Frodo the Errand-Boy.Then it gets better.  You meet Tom Bombadil.  And what does the singing spirit of nature ask of you?  Why, of course, to wander about collecting things.  Boy howdy.  I'm having a blast here.  Apparantly Vivendi's idea of a \"puzzle\" is \"let's hide an item, make them wander for 15 minutes finding it with no action whatsoever, then we'll hide another one and make them start over!\"But you get past Tom Bombadil, and into the great, wide world of Middle-Earth, and what do you do?Become engaged in what is undeniably the most boring RPG ever to hit the GBA.  Walk around.  Get involved in pointless, NON-EXPERIENCE-POINT-GIVING battles!  That's right!  You get NO REWARD for the excruciatingly slow battles whatsoever!  I cannot deny, though, that the game gets much deeper once pointless-battling augments pointless-walking.  I found myself forcing myself to play just to see if the next line of dialogue actually came from the books.  That's never a good sign.Oh, and then we get to Moria.  That's a bit better.  Except for the fact that 1-in-80 cartridges has a critical error that prevents you from CONTINUING PAST THE STAGE!  Really.  ...  I have no idea what Amon Hen is like.  Maybe it gets better.

It's a mediocre RPG and a poor translation of Tolkien.I cannot imagine ANYONE who is in the slightest demanding about their RPGs (or games in general) enjoying this game.  The only redeeming fact about this game is that it is Lord of the Rings.  I admit it was somewhat less aggrivating when I saw familiar locations.  Not fun, mind you, but it did lessen the frustration.Bottom line:If you really want Tolkien, buy the Extended DVD of Fellowship of the Ring, the LoTR trilogy, the Hobbit, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales etc.If you really want a GBA RPG, buy one of the excellent titles mentioned above, or one of the Mega Man Battle Network games.If you want a video game adaptation of the movie, buy EA's The Two Towers.If you want to be disappointed, buy this.\n",
      "First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a  licensed video game gone awry.  You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies.  While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished.  All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs.\n",
      "Is this the same GBA &quot;Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings&quot; that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by &quot;Jack of All Games&quot;. If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not.\n",
      "This game was fun until I got to Rivendell and I couldn't find Gimli. I had read this was a bug and I thought I was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that I read about online, but he wasn't there! I could not leave Rivendell and then I found another bug where if I dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in Rivendell. I couldn't continue and was very frustrated. Up to then I thought the game was cool. Now I'm very unhappy.\n",
      "We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games.  This is the worst game we have ever purchased.  It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing.  It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.\n",
      "I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible.  Don't waste your time.  Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game.  IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also.  Which I read after playing it.  Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun.  Save your MONEY!\n",
      "Looks bad, functions bad.  Cant charge while in case.  Does not protect sides of vita during a fall.  Hangs off awkwardly while playing games.  Extremely ugly.Pros: might protect front and back of vita.  Looks good in garbage can, might be biodegradable.Wow, this thing is really bad.\n",
      "Look,I get that you want to let the vita swing lose to allow access to the back for use with the camera and whatnot, but this is not a CASE.A case implies protection from the elements. I would be ok with (and expecting) a case that I had to take my vita out of to use, but when not in use, would afford my device some level of protection from things like rain, and children, and droppage.This thing does none of that. What it does is expose the entire device on the sides to everything near it. This is literally two pieces of hard leather padding, roughly oval shaped, with the clip in the middle to attach the vita. So you have a leather/vita/leather sandwich. That is not an exaggeration.Seriously. This thing sucks. You're better off with a fanny pack and some foam peanuts.\n",
      "After being dissapointed with Neverwinter Nights, I hestitated to buy another Bioware game, but my sons persuaded me. We tried, we really tried, to play this game. It looked good and started out okay, but quickly got very, very boring. Basically, you just run around, up and down the same corridors.After an initial frenzy of play, all three of us just slowly stopped playing it. After a few weeks, I did a quick poll and then uninstalled and sold it.(During the game, you are supposed to earn light or dark points. By the time I stopped playing, I realized I was still exactly neutral. My oldest son, who was trying to get on the dark side, ended up going toward the light side.)\n",
      "I couldn't give this game a \"fun\" rating, because you have to be able to play a game to know if it's any fun.  I ranked it a 1 because I certainly didn't have any fun with this product.KOTOR didn't allow me that opportunity.When I loaded the game, the framerate was something like 5 frames per second, and that was just the main menu screen.  Once I got into the actual game, it ran at about 2 fps.It's not like I was playing this on an overclocked 486 either.  This was on a brand new computer that I had literally bought the week before I tried to play this game.My specs:Compaq Presario 4012 notebookAMD Athlon 64 3200+ processor512MB of RAMATI Mobility Xpress 200 graphics cardI spent three days mucking about with Bioware's tech support forums before I got an email back from Bioware's tech support that told me that ATI graphics cards in the family that my graphics card is in are incompatible with this game.  If I wanted to play it, I'd need a card from NVIDIA.Gee, that would have been nice to know before buying the game.  Maybe they could have put something in the system requirements (Far Cry, for example, lists the compatible graphics cards in the system requirements)Furthermore, that doesn't explain the fact that the reviewers at Gamespot (who for some inexplicable reason gave the game an 8.8 ranking) noted that they game flat-out wouldn't play on three of the four systems they tried it on.  These are professional game reviewers.  Surely, if a system exists that could handle this game, they would have more than one.  (And one that it crashed frequently on, I might add)The review is here:[...]It's obvious that Bioware developed this game for one hardware configuration, and didn't playtest it on anything that didn't match that configuration.  Bioware is currently blaming ATI for faulty drivers-- adbicating any responsibility they have to release a product that actually works as advertised.Here's a word of advice:  Before you buy this game-- or any game from Bioware-- make darn sure you contact their tech support staff and ask them if the game will work with your specific hardware setup.  And don't accept a \"should work\" answer either.  Otherwise, you might just wind up with a very expensive set of shiny coasters.\n",
      "When I try to play the game, I get a SecuRom error message saying \"Disc emulator detected.\"  The documentation says that, to avoid this error I need to turn off my virus checker.  Are they kidding?\n",
      "WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game and it's sequel DO NOT WORK ony anything above XP!!!!!! Vista, 7, 8, fuggedaboudit!!!!!!!!!! If you get the Xbox version, do NOT play it on the 360 or it'll be riddled with slowdown!\n",
      "Trust me this game will be a stinker.I bought live 2002 last year.The graphics (stink) who cares about coaches or player reactions.That's there problem they spend too much time on reactions and not enough time on gameplay.Get NBA 2k3 Not live 2003.Get real this game is really bad bad and more bad.It is not going to improve unless they get some better graphics in there.The PS1 games of live are better so listen up and stay away.The game will be better then street hoops but not 2k3.I have to say they shure did a better job on madden.\n",
      "Live just keeps gettin' worse and worse and worse.  That's why Sega's 2K saga is the new and better generation of baskerball games.  Live's last greatr game was 2000.  Ever since then, it's been getting worse and less realistic.  To me Live 2001 to 2003 are the same game just a diffrent title and new ranks and changed teams.  I highly recomend 2K3 rather than this garbage.\n",
      "I admit that I haven't gotten very far in this game.  The reason is that I don't like to play this game.  When I turned it on during the day, It was fun when I was helping the hobbitt village people with the little tasks they needed, but then night fall came and I couldn't see jack.  So I thought I would put the game away and play it later that night.  My place was black as pitch except for the light coming from the television and I still couldn't see a thing.  I'm supposed to be avoiding those black riders, but I couldn't see anything.  Somehow I got past that part.  Then more helping villagers.  That's the best part of this game.  I don't remember exactly where I'm at with this game, but I doubt I'll go back.There are far better games to buy for the XBox than this one.  OddWorld, Blood Omen, and Enclave just to name a few.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this...\n",
      "Wow, what a let down.  I was looking forward to this game for a couple of reasons.1.  I love the books2.  I love 3rd person action/adventure games3.  Surreal had something to do with it, and I loved Drakan, the Ancients gate (which this engine obviously shares a lot in common with.....well, except for most of the good parts.)Where to start on this turkey.....A:  Graphics.  Very very similar looking to Drakan the Ancients Gate, but no where near the size/depth of the environments in that game.  The game looks passable, and that's the most favorable word I can use, but the maps/environments are very very small for the most part, and you are more or less on a very narrow *track*.  The graphics in general have a sort of cartoony, empty feel.  The game lacks much mood from a visual standpoint, and that's a shame given the source.B:  Gameplay.  1 word...horrible.  All the problems that plague bad 3rd person adventure games are here.  Camera panning/orientation is one of the worst I've played in a long time, which again is a real shock, as Drakan the Ancients gate is one of the best in that regard I've ever played.  Weapon selection (not that there is much/any) is clumsy, and it's a real problem when using Gandalf especially, not that it matters much as the fighting is so simplistic.  In short, just about everything that can be annoying about control issues in games like this, is.  I really don't understand what happened, as the engine is obviously by and large the same one used in Drakan, and it's fantastic in that game.  Perhaps this game had a different team of people, or was actually in development before Drakan was.Whatever the problem is, it sure is lousy.On top of those two things, the gameplay being the major flaw, the game is shockingly short.  I finnished this game in 5 hours, with no cheats, no online help, no guides, it's laughably short/easy.  Also, the game just feels thrown together.  The cut scenes seem very rushed...it's hard to describe this unless you play it, but it really seems very thrown together.In summary.  I wouldn't buy this game, and I have a hard time even recommending that you rent it.  I'm not sure it's even worth the 6 bucks or whatever your local rental place charges.Avoid at all cost....what a shame, such potential to make a truly great game, and from (at least in part) a company that has made a fantastic game with more or less the same engine.  If your looking for a good 3rd person action/adventure that you may not have played, check out Drakan the Ancients Gate.  It's a much much better game than this, in every way possible.\n",
      "What happened! ToeJam and Earl was an awesome series then this POS came out and totally shot the series to death with cheesey looking characters. The new female character is a stupid joke, a true Toejam and Earl fan would wanna play Lewanda or maybe Sharla instead, or heck even Peabo would be awesome. This game should be banned from the Xbox library it is seriously that bad! The game for one thing is totally pointless, and the gameplay sucks, and the graphics aren't much better than N64 or playstation, maybe worse. Its a bad game that really taints an excellent and unique video game series and also a good system.\n",
      "This so-called halo-killer was sad in comparison. Lame graphics, pathetic story, & characters no one cared about. Worst game Ever.\n",
      "This game is ever so boring. It follows the general Microsoft philosophy of features over everything else: gameplay, story, mechanics, enemy A.I., interesting characters and enemies, locations, and most importantly, fun.I'd like to quickly liken this game to Thanksgiving dinner. It's like Grandma (Micrsoft Game Studios) worked really hard on the bread, potatoes, stuffing, pie and apple cider or whatever but completely forgot to make the turkey. It's not Grandma's fault; she's old. But she doesn't try to charge you fifty bucks to eat her dinner, does she? If she does, don't eat it; many good Chinese restaurants are open on Thanksgiving. If you're not American, you might be scratching your head wondering what \"Thanksgiving\" is. Thanksgiving means this game sucks.To say this game pales in comparison to Halo is an understatement. This game ignored everything it could have learned from Halo. Halo had a plot, interesting characters, fluid controls, good weapons, and addictive gameplay. Brute Force has none of this.Halo was by no means a hard game, but Brute Force barely even punishes you for dying. It hurts your score? You can just keep respawning until you beat the level every time! Talk about taking any possible sense of satisfaction away that I could have gotten. To make things worse, there is basically no enemy A.I. at all. The basic gist of it is: hide behind rock, shoot, hide, shoot, hide, shoot, die. To try to conceal this, the levels were sprinkled with places where the enemy simply wouldn't appear until after I walked by them. I knew these places were coming, but there simply was nothing I could do, for the enemies didn't even exist until the instant they surrounded me. Clever, guys. Real clever.From the very beginning of this game through the ending credits, this game was the least entertaining game I've played since... well, uhh... I'm sure I can think of a game worse than Brute Force... hold on... hmm... maybe this is the worst game EVER! That is quite an accomplishment. At the very beginning, the game was terrible because I had used such rubbery controls very seldom in the past, and certainly not since Playstation (One), but by the time I got used to the controls about five minutes into the first level (it thankfully allowed me to somewhat imitate my Halo control setting), I was already bored of the wishy washy combat and crappy missions.The game has many features that I've craved ever since Perfect Dark like being able to track your kills and other stats, but some of the most important features for any modern action game are missing here: vehicles, challenge, plot, and fun.Because when it comes down to it, the most important test of any game is whether or not it's any fun, and this game just isn't any fun.\n",
      "I can't beleive this game was so poor. The missions were lame. The multiplayer was so annoying. The weapons were poor. And lastly the graphics were so dark I couldn't see the buildings I kept running into. I'm not going to adjust the brightness setting on my T.V. for one game! Forget about trying to scope someone out or using any kind of skill to kill anyone. Its pretty much fire your weapon at will and hope for the best. After playing the pc version online of this game, xbox shouldn't have even bothered putting it out. I would say rent this and find out for yourself before you buy it considering the hype.\n",
      "Stop making \"Medal Of Honor\" games. They have the same stupid A.I, and the same idiotic story. The gameplay just gets OLD really fast. Please, don't even rent this game, spend your time just playing great games, like \"Halo\", or \"Final Fantasy X\", and \"Star Wars:Battlefront.\"\n",
      "Maybe it's a good game. But I never got it. It was never delivered and they have failed to work with me on a solution\n",
      "(...)P>I've played some god-awful adventure games in my day, but I've got to say that without a doubt, this is perhaps the most unplayable I've ever attempted to endure.  Game of the Year?  Best adventure game ever?  I'm boggled by the reviews.  I'm a world-class cheapskate, and I'll finish any game just to say I got my money's worth, but this thing is just insufferable.Let's take a look at the blow-by-blow:1. But it's got gorgeous graphics -- Ok, the scenery's pretty.  Know what?  So was the scenary in Myst, and that suckers a good 5+ years older than TLJ.  And let's keep in mind that when people are raving about the graphics, they're referring to the SCENERY; if it moves in the game (i.e. the characters), then its blocky and clunky.  I've seen better quality in full motion video games than the character models in this thing.2. The voice acting -- Yeah, it's good, which indeed is a rarity these days.  I must confess that I found the main character annoying after a while, but the voice acting was certainly top-notch.  But what good is voice acting when . . . .3. They never shut up -- That's right.  Never.  Never ever.  And every time you meet a character, you're going to find these enourmous dialogue trees, with layers on layers of their childhood, their sexual proclivities, their hopes, their dreams, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.  And, in true adventure game style, you never know which little bit is going to yield that crucial bit of information that you need to progress the game.  So you sit and you listen and you pray for death to come.4. The story is just lame -- Maybe I just have a chip on my shoulder, but what kind of hippie, new age, gobbledy-gook is this?  What was the writer smoking?  I'm quite forgiving, particularly in the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, but this thing is just trite and uninspiring.  My favorite thing about the game is that it'll put some outlandish rule out there, which normally I'd just accept without thinking, but then they try and EXPLAIN it, and it makes no sense.  For example:* Crazy outlandish rule -- So there needs to be a new Guardian every 1000 years.* Me -- Gotcha.  1000 years.  New Guardian.  Check* Expository character who can't stop rambling -- Oh but there's a good reason for the 1000 year cap: the soul can't be separated from the body for longer than that.* Me -- HUH?!?!?!5. It's still all the annoyances of adventure gameplay -- To top it all off, you're still going to be bogged down in the apparently unbreakable rules of an adventure game:A) If you know what you need, but you can't find it, examine every stinking thing in your inventory 'cause it's probably hidden inside something elseB) If you know you need to use something in a specific way, but it just doesn't seem to work, you probably simply haven't placed the object in PRECISELY the right spot to trigger the actionC) When all else fails, spend half and hour blindly trying to combine items in your inventory, and waving inventory items across the screen.  With any luck, you'll stumble across the completely unintuitive Rube-Goldbergian contraption/technique that the game's designers decided was the only possible way to open a window.  If you're less lucky, it means you don't have the right item, so go revisit every location and try to pick up everything you can.  Once you've got something new, repeat blind inventory combining and/or waving until you're allowed to proceed to the next 20 minute monologue on the Balance and the Disc and the Key which is the Disc which has been broken into four which are the keys of the Disc for the Balance.(...) I hope so so that I can run out and enjoy that root canal I've been putting off.\n",
      "Instead of being called \"The Longest Journey\" it should be called \"The Longest Install\". This 4 disk program was the slowest to install game I've ever seen. It must have took 30 minutes to do a complete install.Once I started playing, I was shocked at the profanity. It seemed so out of place. The profanity didn't add anything to the gameplay.The third thing that I didn't like was the Lesbian land lord at the main character's apartment. I didn't want to hear how fulfilled she was with her female lover.This game looks like just a nice adventure game but it's pushing a hidden agenda.I've only played this game for about 30 minutes and it has already become obvious that this game is not appropriate for children.It's too bad that you can't even play a computer game without the [...] agenda being slipped in.\n",
      "Dont buy Nightfire. It is very boring. The missions are long and stupid. I hate all the bond games especialy the new one. The colors in the game are really bad. And the guns are stupid and not real in real life. Theres a automatic gun with a scope and you cant look trough the scope. Unless you love bond games dont buy this. The grafics suck.\n",
      "Don't be fooled, this game sucks.  I got it for my birthday last year, and it doens't match up to 007: Goldeneye (one of the best games ever made), so don't be fooled\n",
      "Nintendo has shafted me again, first with a n64 that had no third party support. Now the same thing has happened with my Gamecube. I own all three new systems plus 5 older systems and I work for software etc. I know my business and our sales speak volumes. XBOX sales have picked up while Gamecube sales have dropped. well there is always the next system. For Gamecube I had to buy memory cards, a keyboard, an ethernet adapter, Then I bought an XBOX. Unlimited memory, and the only thing you might have to purchase is a dvd playback kit(which is cheaper than a Gamecube memory card). I own a real dvd player and im not stupid enough to use my console as a primary dvd player. Gamecube doesnt even have this option. This is 2003, 99% of the world doesnt have to use their game console as a dvd player. I found that most of the games on Gamecube are on XBOX except on XBOX they contain extras, far better graphics, sound and some even add online play. While online you can chat in every game, no need for a keyboard. Gamecube only offers 1 game with online play(shame on them).XBOX has over 235 games available and over 250 for this year alone, so games is not an issue. Finally someone has built a better system then ps2 and Gamecube. ps2 is good, gamecube is better, but the loading times, muddy jaggy graphics, no dolby digital,and now its losing all its exclusives to xbox. ps2 &amp; gamecube exclusives are getting fewer and the ones they have are seeking ways to get their games on other systems. GTAVC for example, rockstar is planning on releasing a side story to gta only for XBOX, so you can expect great graphics and much better gameplay on xbox. With games like Halo 2, Tao feng, Project Gothom 2, Dino Crisis 3, UFC Tapout 2, Dead or Alice Chronos, Brute force, Rallisport 2, Mech Assault,Unreal Championship, Panzer Draggon Orta, and many more exclusives, the proof is there if you look, developers are putting their best games on XBOX and then dumping the left overs on ps2 and gamecube. The XBOX exclusive games put anything the ps2 or gamecube has done to shame. Halo was released over a year ago and there still has been nothing from ps2 or gamecube that even comes close to the graphics, sound, story and even the online play rocks even though its not offical through xbox live, you have to play through gamespy. The new 800 pound gorilla is here, and its name is xbox.\n",
      "The one I received was very clearly pirated as the moment you turn the system on you are prompted by their pirate call signs before it even shows the Nintendo logo.\n",
      "Was not able to play it.  It was my mistake I though it was for xbox 360, did not realize it was not, my mistake\n",
      "I see a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews on this game. I dont know maybe there playing another game because from what I see from this game is not at all impressive. While the concept and graphics of the game is good, the control of this game is where it falls way WAY short. Controlling your characters is a task in itself and are too cumbersome, simply walking/running in narrow areas can get frustrating, I won't even going into aiming to kill birds that fly off the screen only to come back and attack you from the entirely other direction. I don't know if this was done intentially to make the game harder than it really is, but it works!! On top of that the characters seem slow to respond to your actions, when your trying to pick something up, you have to press the button and wait to see if it responds, you press the shoot button, and your characters just stand there while getting attacked, when your attcked by something an get pushed to the previous screen, you can still be attacked even though you can't see where it is so you can shoot it. Top this off with barely enough ammo to kill the cheesy zombies that grab you and take 7 shots to kill with the pistol. I'm sure the controls take some getting used to, but this game is just too boring to want to learn the controls. The game it self moves entirely too slow and it littered with too many useless and corny cut screens. Cut screens when you pick up something, cut screens when you walk up or down stairs, cut screens when you climb a ladder, cut screens when you open a door, cut screen when you switch character controls. And if the game wasn't already SLOW enough, text goes across the screen slooowly and there is no way to make it go faster. \"A..R..E.T..H..E.......F..A..I..N..T......S..O..U..N..D..S......O..F.........F..O..O..T..S..T..E..P..S.....T..H..O..S..E.....O..F.....S..U..R..V..I..V..O..R..S.?\" is NOT something I want to sit through EVERY SINGLE time I load a game.I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this game....If this game had fewer cut screens was more faster paced and most importantly, had controls like Xbox's Splinter cell, then maybe this would be a very good game. But as it stands, my second GameCube game is a waste of my time and money. I guess I was spoiled by my Xbox's splinter cell and even my game cube's Metroid Prime. And to think I thought splinter cell was cumbersome when I first played it. HA! Don't waste your money unless you absolutely LOVE the resident evil series.\n",
      "Like the headline says, but the fact that I have been playing this story for over 8 years now makes this a waste of time. I turned it off after an hour. Enough said. Buy Resident Evil 4, its the best one since the Original. Maybe the best of all.\n",
      "X-men The Next Dimension for the Xbox is a fighting game where you get to fight with your favorite X-man character. The major ones included are: Cyclops, Jean, Wolverine, Night Crawler, Storm and many more which can be unlocked when you beat the games. Your characters can do basic punch, kick, combo moves anduse their special powers. You can play by yourself or with a friend in versus mode. I hated this game because the controls were sluggish, the animation looked choppy and weird. The sound is the worst ever in a fighting game! The hits sound like Tiny slap sounds. All of the combo attacks suck, they feel very generic. I'm an X-men fan, but this game is horrible. Save your money and buy Dead or Alive (the bomb).Pros:+X-men characters+good graphics+versus a friendCons:-sluggish controls-terrible sound effects-generic music-choppy animations-fighting techniques suck-retarded A.I.\n",
      "after renting this game to my dismay i found ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING new or different about this port.the graphics are the same as it was 3 years ago on the defunct sega dreamcast.what's worse..no online option and you can't play your own souindtracks to replace the horrible jazz ecentric BGM during the battle stages. the music was MUCH MUCH better on capcom's previous efforts I.E. MARVEL SUPER HEROES, MARVEL VS CAPCOM OR EVEM XMEN VS STREET FIGHTER (heh, no wonder why i still have my SEGA SATURN as well as my DC)but if the XBOX is your only system then your'e left with only one option buy it, otherwise avoid..btw where's the gamecube version...oh you mean there isn't one for the lamecube??...oops!\n",
      "Personally I think this game isn't as good as it could be, I'd suggest buying Mortal Kombat instead really.g!\n",
      "This game was one of the worst I've ever played.  The graphics are decent, but they just can't match the old Contra from the NES.  The day that they realize this, and stop making stupid games like this one, the better.\n",
      "Graphics don't make a game, they merely add to the enjoyment of the game play and interaction. This game is ridiculous. The volleyball portion it basically a cpu controlled mess that involves more luck than strategy. What's fun about a game in which you have to constantly bribe girls to partner with you in matches you have a better chance of losing that winning? Plus the real rules of volleyball aren't even applied to this game. And what's up with the weird deuce rules when there's a tie score? But honestly, this game isn't really about volleyball. It's digital Barbie dolls for guys. You earn cash to dress up the girls in outfits your girlfriend would never wear on the hottest day of the year in private.The totallity of this game feels more like a collection of bad mini games rather than one cohesive one. The fact that this game is getting 5 stars from consumers saddens me, because it proves that T&A;, cgi or not, is enough to get people to by something, and enjoy it somewhat. I don't mind the digital skin..I'd just need digital substance to go along with it. I'm glad I didn't actually buy this crap.\n",
      "This game is boring .the volleyball is just way too weak to keep your attention for more than a few hours.the girls are beautiful but they all speak japanease(which really gets annoying). its more of a game of dress up the ultra hot dolly than a volleyball game.the most nudity in the game is the thong bikinis that you can make them wear.The casino is also quite boring youve got poker,blackjack and a host of similar slot machines.The consensus between me and everyone i have let use or play this game is that the chicks are hot but how long can you look at a pixelated hottie before you realize the game has no substance.\n",
      "This game is only for hormone-raging 13 year old kids who can't get their hands on actuall pornography so its aimed towards their hormones. The game is actually not a good game. If one of your \"not-as-smart\" friends has the game you might want to try it, but its not worth the money nor time to rent or buy. The ONLY other reason to buy this game is IF you are a DIE HARD Dead or Alive \"collectors\" fan.\n",
      "Dead or Alive Volleyball, is a pretty weak game. It does has beautiful graphics; the women wearing bikinis and sun bathing or playing volleyball. ... The backdrops are beautiful as well, with nice beaches and island spots. I also had a bit of fun with the casino mini games included. When you gamble and win at the casino games, you earn money to buy gifts for your girl/characters- buy them a new swimsuit, candy, flowers. It tries to simulate interaction with a virtual girl, but it is very limited. The volleyball game (which is the whole purpose of the game) lacks responsive controls, and has very bad camera angles. The bad camera angles ruin the whole game because when you are playing volleyball, either your character or ball will leave the play screen and then you end up losing points! Terrible. The music and sound effects are generic but they can be turned down.Pros:+beautiful women+beautiful back drops+casino gamesCons:-junk controls-camera angles sucks-you cannot adjust camera angles-generic music-weak sound effects-not very excitingOverall this game is below average, it tried to implement lots of good ideas, and the casino games was a nice bonus, but the negative points affect it badly.\n",
      "i would have bought this game what the hell up with the big giggle [...]? i am a girl i dont wont to look at that the dude who made this is a perv!\n",
      "First off,I want to say that I loved wild arms 1 and 2;as such I was expecting to love wild arms 3....WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!One extremely annoying new \"feature\" was the random battle encounter gauge.Unlike 2 where you would get a \"!\" above your head so that you could run away from a random battle,WA3 only lets you do this 10 times,then you HAVE to fight.Another bad feature was the fact that everyone uses guns;you can hit with your fists(when your out of ammo)but it does such lame damage that it's not even worth trying.Also the personal skills system was changed for the worse(having to equip an item,fight so many battles and then having the item dissapear after you've learned the skill)The characters and the story were also short of my expectations for the series.While janus & co.(bad guys) were sometimes funny and sometimes despicable,they were nowhere near as great as say liz & ard from part 2.The game also felt like it was TRYING to make a story just to give you a point to do things,whereas the previous two installments had great stories to them which also just happened to be games.The only good thing about this game is the graphics;not the ahh and ooo 3D type,but the fact that all of the characters looked like they were hand painted with water colors,and that was impressive.The only noticable music in the game was the traditonal wild arms opening that's heard during the train scene after you play all four character intros.The very start was sung in voices with a hymn-like effect;very nice.Everything afterward is just hum drum,average run-of-the-mill.All in all Wild Arms 3 is just another video game sequal that bombed!\n",
      "Wild Arms 3 is a terribly mediocre RPG that simply never should have been made.The Good:Relatively nice cel-shaded graphics. Period. Nothing else.The Bad:Incredibly flat characters, predictable and cliched storyline, repetitive and stupid battle system, lack of any good enemies, you can't get any new guns, music is very limited, doesn't sound like the Wild West.Conclusion:Wild Arms 3 could've been a good RPG worth 4 stars with some improvements, unfortunately the developers obviously didn't try very hard. Don't even bother with this game. Not worth your time at all. Try Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X-2, Dark Cloud 2, Suikoden 3, or Grandia 2. They are much better than this game.\n",
      "Well I am very disappointed...very.Here are the bad things.- Horrible graphics- corny storyline- no real voices- same old battle system.what else? Well for one the graphics repeat, the music is very annoying..it just keeps playing over and over the same part, and they don't even explain the complicated menus..you have to figure it out for yourself. The graphics are flat, and more like cartoon characters..obviously the creaters tried to make it look \"cute\" and save some time and $$. There is a reason it's cheaper than the other games..because it is cheap. it isn't worth the rent money either..\n",
      "I love RPGs. The PS2 has produced some really excellent games for the genre including Final Fantasy X, the Shadow Hearts series, and Disgea: Hour of Darkness. Wild Arms 3 is not going to be joining this list of RPG awesomeness any time soon. It's not even going to be joining my list of decent RPGs. This game is terrible, and I just could not finish it! Trust me I tried and there was a period of two weeks when I couldn't bring myself to even turn the game on.I thought a western-themed RPG would be something really unique, but I was wrong. This has got to be one of the most cliched things I've ever seen. It's the third in a series that appears to be rather popular. I did end up hating this game, but strangely I'm not totally put off from playing a Wild Arms game ever again. Maybe since this is the third game, it's just an unfortunate casuality of sequel-itis.The Good:The music's pretty good. It's appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare you'd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tone.Fighting on horseback! This only unique from a visual point of view. The game still plays in exactly the same turn-based Final Fantasy-esque way as if you were on foot, but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepies.Save Anywhere! You can provided you have an item called a Gimel Coin, but luckily those are easy to find.The Bad:Cliched plot. It starts out with promise. Your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this Indian Shaman tribe called the Baskars. Classic Western! Then the adventurers, called Drifters, team up and take an assignment from the Baskar's head Shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet Filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop. It's down hill from there. Suddenly, instead of a Western game, I'm playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystals/dragons/betamax VCRs quest.... but with firearms! Soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts. So they set out, to discover why Filgaia is dying and play follow-the-bad guys. It's almost like playing Final Fantasy VII over again, and I never liked that game much in the first place.Characters that come right out of anime central casting. The characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold. You have Gallows, a ne'er-do-well Shaman, who learns some bland lesson on freedom, heritage, and self-actualization on the journey. Brainy, tough guy Clive, who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail. Jet Enduro, surly anti-social amnesiac, and worst of the bunch Virginia Maxwell. For some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch. She's naive, gulliable, and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps. She's one of those annoyingly perky types and her \"Come on guys! Let's do our best for Justice, Truth, and blah blah\" is more Big Bird than Clint Eastwood. She's also looking for the dead-beat dad she hasn't seen in 10 years. The anime feel is helped along by the video sequences (complete with corny songs) that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play. Trust me. It's frickk'n annoying after you've seen them ten times.Sandcraft battles. During the game you get a sandcraft vehicle. If you run into a monster in this thing, the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback. That's not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes each!The Ugly:Healing Items are hard to find. Healing Items are scarce, so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically. There are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive. It adds challenge, but since I didn't enjoy the game it just it that more annoying.Search system. If you want to find something on the map, you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin, town, or whatever appear. It's time consuming and also makes the game extremely linear.Boring Level Design. You'll send more of you're time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape. In the ruins, you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am I supposed to do here? difficulty. A critic once said level design was key, and Wild Arms 3 makes me see how right he was. All the ruins look exactly the same. I know I'm throwing a switch in the ruin in the North, but I did the exact same thing in the ruin to the South which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the West.  Get my point? It feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not traveling to a Forest of Doom or a Cloud City of Eternal Happiness. It's just ruins and towns, and they all look the same!\n",
      "I was hoping for a western adventure. This game let me down. I was hoping for a unique RPG but boy was I wrong. This game is boring. I'm glad I got it at a clearance price. I reget ever getting this game. I hope I can sell it  very soon.Don't waste your money.\n",
      "This is absolutley terrible, what were they thinking? The graphics alone rank! I shouldn't even refer to them as graphics but rather &quot;cartoon&quot; graphics. The mission and storyline are bogus and lame. I dare anyone who says this is a great game to play EA's Two Tower or Return of the King then play this one.If you don't mind wasting your money, then go for it and buy it, but if you want great games that enhance the LOTR book and movies, go and buy EA's Two Towers and Return of the King.\n",
      "I hate this game. The only reason I have it is because when I bought a Spyro game it was free. I played it probably 8 times before I found out its was boring and impossible to beat. I have never been a fan of Lord of the Ring but i thoght the game would be ok. I was wrong. It was horrible. I have never played it in over 1 year. Even if you are a big fan of Lord of the Rings I think your going to find this game boring and stupid.Please tell me if my reveiw was helpful or not.\n",
      "I made a terrible mistake and bought this game for $49.99 the day it came out. If I waited a month (which I wished I did) I could've bought it for $20. This has to be by far one of the worst games I ever played. Needless to say I played it for about 45 minutes and quit, I never played it again. I thought it was boring, graphics and movement were terrible. Honestly if someone gave me this game for free I wouldn't take it. I love the books, all 3 movies were great, this game shouldn't exist. I wasn't too impressed with the other Lord of the Rings Games either but this one is definately the worst out of all. Try to avoid this one at all cost.\n",
      "Wow, what a let down.  Here's the short version.1.  Horrible control.  Very awkward, especially the camera.  Worst camera I've seen in a game like this in a long long long time.2.  Short/small/linear.  Laughably short.  I beat this game in 5 hours.  No cheats, no hints,....so short, so easy, just.... laughable.Go buy/rent Drakan the Ancients gate.  Uses a similar engine (the good parts done by surreal), but just a much much much better game, in every way imaginable.I certainly wouldn't recommend buying this, and I be hard pressed to even recommend renting it, it's not even worth the 6 bucks it cost to rent....what a let down, avoid at all costs.\n",
      "Common sense to me in making a good video game sequal,would be sticking to what made the previous installment/s great...NOPE! That ain't gonna happen in this age! For some reason game developers are almost sadisticaly compelled to add \"new\" stuff and completely throw away the tried and true elements that veterans of a series have come to know and love.Suikoden 3 is the fourth RPG that I have played for the PS2 which originated on an older system.And like the other three(Wild Arms 3,Legend Of Legia 2 and Final Fantasy X)it [bites] because they change way too much;almost to the point of feeling like an entirely diffrent game instead of a sequal.I hate to say it,but I think the death of good rpgs is upon us.Fun and traditonal gameplay is being replaced with eye candy and foreign concepts.I'd rather play good ol' dragon warrior on the 8bit nintendo than these peices of junk!I STRONGLY advise lovers of the first two installments of suikoden to rent this game before buying it.\n",
      "to sum this up quickly, this is one of the most bland, boring, slow, and inspirationless RPGs i have ever played in my life. the battles reach a new level of monotony and the EXTREMELY stiff animations, bland backgrounds, and a total lack of texture variety contribute to this. the hugely frequent random battles are a huge turn-off, as you'd think RPG designers all realized that random battles are not fun. the story is absolutely ridiculous and in the five or six chapters for all the characters that i trudged through, nothing happened that was at all interesting. nothing. of the three main characters, only Hugo is worth playing, since he's the only one that EVER shows emotion or does ANYTHING worth watching. Chris and that mercenary guy whose name i forget are complete jokes. they're the most pointless character designs i've ever seen. their stories are absolutely NO fun. don't even get me started on the secret chapters that you can unlock. Tom's, for example, is a quest across the same three towns where you recruit people. you don't know who you can recruit, so you have to talk to everyone in every town, and sometimes buy an item for them to convince them to join you. Fun. as for the music and sound, they're just as sub-par. sound effects are SPARSE, and the music is as uninspired as it gets. i actually kept this game thinking it would get better considering the raving reviews (and the awesome intro), but it's absolutely pathetic. a massive tarnish on the suikoden series.\n",
      "Do Not Buy This Game.... not like the original SNES version.  It is also way too hard.  Their is just way too much going on for such a small screen, you cant help but get disoriented.  This game should of never been made for game boy.  On a big screen with a real controller, yeah it would totally be cool.\n",
      "Whatever happened to the Shinobi plotlines in the old Genesis games such as Shadow Dancer, Legend of Shinobi and Shinobi III? What happened to Joe Mushasi and his faithful dog sidekick? What about the evil Union Lizard Corp? None of that is in this. It's just generic hokum and the Ninja dude is the only one to save the day.The graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage. It was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fifty-millionth time it seriously gets on your nerves.There's no variance or long-lasting appeal to this. It makes me long for the old-school Shinobi. Side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as Shadow Dancer are still better than this. It's very dull. It looks good but it plays poorly.\n",
      "Beware!!!! i watch all the reviews and thought it was a good game WROGGGGGGGGGG i played for two stages and that was it for me.lost all interest right away. so BEWARE this is a waste of money.im not going to waste writing more because it doesnt ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzZZZZ sorry i felt sleep, i try to play it again zzzzzZZZZZZZ\n",
      "If your looking for the old Spyro you won't find it here. Vivendi Universal has totally trashed the Spyro legacy.Anything that can be wrong with a game is in this one. Looks like Vivendi Universal released this game before they even tested it because as far as I'm concerned this game is unplayable. Long load times and frame rate problems are just a few of the problems. I played this game for 10 minutes and I could not play it anymore. Don't waste your money. Buy Insomniacs new game Ratchet &amp; Clank. It's 10 bucks cheaper and 1000 times better. FYI - Insomniac was the original developer of Spyro.\n",
      "I mean look, Spyro was good in his early days, but now, he's garbage.  The spyro saga has took a turn for the worst.  I mean this game grows boring reel fast, and I'm glad I rented it.  Spyro was one of my favorite games, now it's one of the best games that can spell G-A-R-B-A-G-E!!  Do not enven spend ur money 2 rent or spend ur time 2 borrow, this is the game that tarnished the shining saga.\n",
      "It's astonishing to see so many positive reviews for this game.  I could only stand it for about 20 minutes before I quit.  Lousy controls, terrible graphics (especially on a big monitor), awful pathfinding (click somewhere and hope it doesn't take you somewhere you didn't expect (like right by a guard).  Pretty boring to boot.Who could possibly give this game FIVE stars?  I'm beginning to lose faith in Amazon's rating system.\n",
      "the game diden't play at allvery disapointedfeel lied to about conditionwaste of money so unhappy with this.\n",
      "Ive been waiting two years for this? This game is a joke.The graphics are nowhere near what the claims are.It waslike steppin' back into the seventies and playing defenderor something along those lines...Only it wasn't that fun!If you want killer graphics get Enclave...Every game shouldlook that good.There is no excuse for grainy or childishgraphics,in this day and age...It's just plain lazy.\n",
      "THIS GAME IS STUPID ITS SO INCREDBALY BORING I PLAYED IT FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES THAN I COULDNT STAND HOW STUPID IT WAS. ONE OF BIGGEST DISSPOINTMENTS OF THE YEAR.MAYBE RENT BUT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT BY BUYING IT.NO WONDER THIS GAME IS BAD ITS ON XBOX\n",
      "Well all the hype on the demo disks made me go out and buy this Xbox live.  It looks like a pretty good product, but when I went to set it up, nope, couldnt connect.  When I visited the Xbox Live website, I was informed that it will not work with AOL Broadband.  I thought since I could use my playstation network adapter that AOL had also allowed Xbox Live.  Guess I assumed incorrectly.  The headset is a little tricky to put together, but everything seems nice.  Playing the demos included with the Xbox Live disk are fun, but they are only demos.  I do wish that for the cost of this, you would have gotten a full version game with it.Unfortunately, I'll be taking this back or selling it, since my pleas to AOL to allow Xbox Live are answered with &quot;We're aware of this situation and are working on solutions to allow this&quot;\n",
      "Please don't buy this game my husband played it twice and both times in different areas the game just locked up. We tried getting another disc and it did the same thing halfway through and in different missions the game once more locked up.  Rent it only that way you are saved from the locking up.  I believe that UBI Soft put alot of bad discs on the market and yet we haven't found one that didn't lock up.  RENT DON'T BUY!!!\n",
      "worst game i have everplayed, wasteoftime and of money.\n",
      "I am thoroughly confused as to how this game rates so highly.I recently saw that it was up for \"Game of the Decade\" at one of my favorite gaming websites, and was utterly flabbergasted.---Story--- ~2/5 StarsFor a GBA game, it's a fine story.  For a Metroid game, it's awful.  There is no sense of isolation, a key factor of the franchise.  Samus is following non-sensical orders from a computer, with zero effort to justify them.  The entire game, the player is told to slowly traverse seven various areas of a large space station, each time allowing your enemies to further infiltrate the station.  And, why?  FOR NO REASON.  A quick boil-down of the premise:  (1)There are parasites on board; they are incredibly dangerous and cannot safely be interacted with.  (2)Go run around with them, reacting to their presence on the ship and helping them spread.  (3)Uh-oh.  Things aren't going well?  Why, how did that happen!?!?!The only reason this story gets a second star out of five is that were one to take the Metroid logo off of it, slap new names on the characters and pretend it's a new franchise, it would be slightly less intolerable.---Gameplay--- ~1/5 StarsThe worst comment for a Metroid-style game: It is unbelievably linear.  The player has zero option as to how to proceed.  Doors are locked or unlocked for you, and you cannot get around them until the very end of the game.  What's worse, you are forced to hold poorly-written, one-way conversations with the computer character between every action.  Enter a new area: Talk to the PC.  Find a power-up: Talk to the PC.  See a boss off in the distance: Talk to the PC.  I found this absolutely inexcusable.Samus is simultaneously over-powered for some enemies and wholely defenseless against others.  The vast majority of enemies, and most bosses, take two shots to kill and don't cause any damage when they hit you.  Several other bosses and a hand-full of general enemies can kill Samus with three or so hits, and require all your missiles to kill.  There seems to be no logic as to enemies' difficulties, and you will often find yourself frustrated by situations where you can only succeed if very lucky.There are so many power-ups as to make it completely unfulfilling to collect them.  Furthermore, while most are lying in plain view and the player walks into them as a matter of course, others are so meticulously hidden and require pain-staking, repeated effort to collect as to be intolerably frustrating and not worth the effort.  The casual gamer will be bored, and the completionist will be frustrated.  It's just awful.---Replay--- ~1/5 StarsIf you can actually bring yourself to pick this game up a second time, you'll find both the linear-ness and the forced conversations with the computer character even more mind-numbing.  There are few things worse than a forced cut-scene, which you cannot skip, slowly explaining something you already know.  There is simply no point in replaying this game.---Overall--- ~1/5 StarsIt's just a bad game.  And it's absolutely awful for a Metroid Game.  I greatly regret this purchase, and, for the life of me, cannot understand how it gets such good reviews.\n",
      "This one I don't get.  The developers of this game took the time to license the actual theme song of the sorely missed TV series, got the actual actors Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly to do the voices for the characters, which lends a great degree of authenticity...and managed to come up with a horrible, horrible game.There's nothing wrong with the look of the game, and the Dark Angel franchise fits the popular genre of stealth/espionage games quite well.But I noticed one thing amiss right off the bat:  Where's the tutorial level?  Every game I've ever played which involves stealth, like Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter and Splinter Cell:  Pandora Tomorrow, gives you a tutorial mission because in a stealth game, not only do you have to know the controls, you have to get familiarized with them within a gradual learning curve so that movement of your character becomes second nature; in a stealth game, no good player ever \"remembers\" the moves -- he feels them.  But Dark Angel has chosen to forego this step, and the result is that the controls, already not hugely responsive, are all but alien to me.  I figured out some things on my own -- the manual is scanty and poorly written -- but nothing can replace the all-important tutorial.There's also no radar, a must in a game of this type, and looking around is laborious and risky.  Most of the time the camera prevents you from seeing what you need to see to sneak through the missions effectively.  No maps, either -- and added to the fiddly mission layouts, I spent so much time running around missions trying to find things that the gameplay just slowed to a crawl.  To slow things down even more, the loading times on this game are incredible.  Even the \"Replay Stage\" command, when you're trying to stop your current mission and start from the top, takes about a minute to load.  Awful.I don't like the proportions of this game -- too much environment and not enough of the character.  It makes moving around seem more sluggish than it should be, and when you're fighting, it really spoils much of the fun factor.  I'd rather have had a character-screen proportion closer to Syphon Filter or Jet Li's Rise to Honor.  And whoever came up with the idea of using a Matrix-style \"bullet time\" while you fight obviously doesn't know how to design fighting games, because it makes fighting a bore.  You can't control when the slow-motion occurs, so you end up having to wait before you can execute the next move.  This feature basically takes your in-game control of your character away from you randomly -- something that should *never* happen in an action game.I am tremendously disappointed, because the TV series, the wonderful character of Max, the setting...everything was just perfect for a video-game translation.  And they had taken the effort to get Alba and Weatherly, put James Cameron's name on the box, and get so many of the stylistic touches right (good one-liners in the dialogue) that it's a shame that the game is mechanically unplayable.  Seems like they spent all their money and time on aesthetics and forgot to test out the mechanics...no wonder this game is now widely available second-hand for less than six dollars, less than a year after I first saw it available.  I will probably sell mine soon.\n",
      "The developers of this game dropped the ball like a ton of bricks.  Don't get me wrong.  The idea was cool: Four characters, each with their own technique and weapons, trying to rid the world of zombies and other possessed creatures.  But, believe me, that's where the excitement ends.From what I hear, playing this with 3 friends is where the fun lies, but if you're going alone, the only reasonable character choice is Duece.  He is the strongest and has the most reach with his axe.  You'll find that he is the ONLY one capable of handling the endless amount of enemies that appear out of nowhere, which is one of the game's biggest problems.The enemies keep respawning.  What's the point of killing tens of monsters, if they're only going to respawn seconds later?  It's repetative and pointless.  There's almost nothing worse than fighting through an area only to find that the same people you killed a moment ago keep coming back.Another HUGE problem with this game is the camera angles.  You have zero control over it.  All this game allows you is a zoom in feature, which only serves to make your experience worse.  Countless times I found myself turning a blind corner and having to actually walk a few seconds before the camera allowed me to see down that path.  That's the kind of thing that gets you needlessly killed.Next, we have the bosses.  Okay, so who's bright idea was it to make bosses so cheasy?  The first boss I fought had a horde of monsters helping him kill me, and none of them were moving slow enough for me to think too hard.  The second one, a Teddy Bear, wouldn't stop chasing me.  I had to literally run around in circles, avoiding killer spirits, while occasionally jumping to avoid Teddy Bear induced earth quakes and vomit, all the while trying to get a shot with my special weapon.  You literally only have seconds to get that one shot off.  By the way, if you run out of ammo for that special weapon, just restart, because you will not defeat that leader with anything else.  Sound like fun?  I didn't think so.The next problem is the cycling of the weapons.  During the game, I found that it takes certain weapons to destroy certain creatures.  For example, the spirits and gargoyles cannot be killed with guns and the spiders and alligators cannot be killed with blunt strikes, unless you want to die, of course.  I've tried and it resulted in either my death or a huge loss of energy.  It's a nice concept, but you'll find yourself running back and forth as you try to cycle from one weapon to another as you attempt to rid yourself of deadly spiders as the spirits are coming at you simultaneously.The final problem is the need to reload your special weapon.  Okay, I understand this concept, but then ammo is not easy to come by.  Why couldn't they just make this like Blood Rayne and give you the chance to reload when you kill someone who has a gun?  Also, why does the chainsaw have such a short limit?  It's not like it does any more damage than your regular weapon.So basically, the game sucks.One more thing.  The guy that does the voice for the mysterious dark creature that tells you why this happened sounds like the Mayor of Grant City in Dead to Rights.  They sound exactly the same, in fact, only this character is overly melodramatic.\n",
      "I played Hunter in Role playing game and is really funny and awesome, but this game sucks, the game don't have a good game-play, the characters looks like a manga cheap kind, the only bottom I use is the gun bottom because is the only thing you can made. The music is cheaper and the story is stupid.\n",
      "A friend purchased this game for me recently to try, since he has been playing it for approximately two months. I played the game for about two weeks, from about May 10th to 26th (2008).Client Stability and Server AvailabilityIn general, the game engine is about as sophisticated as many three to four year old games - regarding graphics, audio, and general complexity. So, it runs very well even on older hardware.The servers are brought down fairly regularly. I didn't play every day, but it seems as though the servers were down every day, sometimes for several hours, sometimes just for one.Audio/VisualThis game looks and feels three or fours years old. It's prosaic and unremarkable in this department. Really nothing worth mentioning.Game PlayEve Online can be summarized as \"the greatest experience for hardcore, long time MMO players\". At the same time, one can easily refer to it as \"the most boring, time sink filled, banal and repetitious computer gaming experience ever fabricated in mind or reality\". Unless you're a masochist this game is not for you. In my humble opinion.Support and ServiceYour petitions for support/assistance are only handled during scheduled outages. Even so, it routinely takes ten or more hours for issues to be addressed, and roughly half the time the issues are not resolved. Once my character became \"locked\", that is, the client would crash whenever I attempted to log into it. I was told two days after submitting my petition that this was due to a bug that required game master intervention, and that they had corrected it. However, all of my resources that I had spent a week collecting were missing. I politely requested assistance acquiring the lost items (a typical and benign problem in all MMOs). I was denied, told that it was not in the EULA (odd that they would refer to the end user license agreement for software for this issue) and - get this - actually told by support that I can feel free to cancel my subscription. Heh. Amazing customer service there. So I did.ConclusionOld technology and graphics, constant outages, poor audio, repetitious game play filled with outdated time sinks, and extremely poor customer support. I recommend avoiding this game.\n",
      "I bought a Nyko Worm Cam a while ago and I am really disappointed. It advertises that it takes great digital pictures but it really doesn't. It is very slow and hard to use and the color is always grainy and dull. If you try to print your pictures they always come out blurry if you print them any bigger than wallet size. It is also hard to aim your picture, it doesn't have any sort of view finder or anything like that. And if you take pictures outside and it's a cloudy day you STILL have to use that small easy to lose sun filter. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this lousy piece of [junk] and I hope you don't either...\n",
      "Years ago I asked for, and got, this Nyko camera for my GBA. Taking pictures with it is fairly easy and it has a bunch of nice features and modes for it. Picture quality is horrible, though. Even in the correct modes, the best quality pics were not easy to even recognize what it was of. The pc uploading software is basic and worthless for two reasons.1.It won't work correctly on newer PCs.2.As bad as the pictures are that it takes, you won't even want to save them. You'd be embarrassed to be seen saving them.Please, for your own sake, if you want a GBA camera, save your money and buy a good one.\n",
      "I expected this game to be a fitting sequel to Dark Cloud which was repetitive but fun overall but it isn't It's just repetitive. The graphics look amazing but that's the only plus. It does use the same dungeon crawler style but the enemies are downright pathetic, you're weilding a wrench as a weapon, not a sword. You pretty much die the moment you get hit. I recently put it back into my ps2 because I'd decided I never really gave it too much of a chance but it was a big mistake. It made me hate myself even more for wasting all that money and time. You'd be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder.  A giant elephant and a big fat clown with dynamite strapped to his half-naked body  (It's not the psychotic kind of clown you see  in horror movies either.) is hardly worth  fighting if at all and the story is utterly ridiculous. By the time max actually saw the outside world I expected the problem and solution to be explained but all we get is \"A bad guy destroyed the world and we don't know why.\" They never even explain where the characters are going and why.The races in the last game (Though underdeveloped as characters) were loads more interesting than anything I ever saw in this  poor excuse for a sequel. I played long enough to encounter the \"firbits\". Rip offs of the seven dwarves from snow white. (They even have you keep an eye out for a woman who appeared in their forest one day, made their lives better and mysteriously disappeared.) NOTHING about this game keeps the player interested. You don't know why Max does anything when the adventure starts Or how Monica supposedly came from the future when the first time we see her she's in a castle  fighting stupid looking monsters and the next time she's a boy  with an oversized shirt on who apparently has a knack for  transmitting telekinetic messages into Max's mind.I got hours in and nothing makes sense. Nothing. I think they  just drew the scenes and characters from a hat and patched them together at random. You'd be better off buying a product called \"Heart -attack in a can.\"  Don't  buy this.\n",

      "Ok the graphics for the game are killer! no doubt about it top notch pretty cool.  heres the bad..... no health meters, you cant punch anybody, (only pistol whip), your charcter is arrested way too easyily.  The controls of this game really suck!  and you cant adjust them to make them the way you want them.i really cant belive they made a game look so cool have such great feautures then make playing the actual game suck!! there are movie sequences that you cant fast forward threw and they take litterly forever!!i wish they had kept working on this game it had so much potential but it fell flat on it's face!

Many of the small failures of this game will make you not want to play it. They took a relativly simple game and made it slow-paced and annoying. I don't see how so many people gave this game a high rating. Clearly they don't know anything about video games! Just like the people who creating this one...\n",

      "The camera angles in this game absolutely stink. They remain fixed and do not follow you around as you move through the game. This method of gameplay worked pretty well in the hit series Resident Evil, but plays out very poorly in this game. It's difficult to maintain fighting sequences with bad guys and to see exactly what you're doing. The fighting sequences are very frustrating and the punch and kick combos look terrible (Batman kicks low, to the shins! now that's low for the dark knight).The tools also stink. The batarangs and smoke bombs are awkward to use, and pretty much unusuable during combat.I do have to give this game some props for the music track and style - both of which are very good. But the gameplay is awkward. This game is difficult, and not in a good way. Huge batman fans, prepare to be disappointed.\n",

      "Is it possible to produce a good game based Batman?  I can't remember ever playing a good one, going all the way back to the old &quot;Batman Returns&quot; on the Sega Genesis.  And this game is even worse than that.  It features the worst camera angles I've ever seen on a game (while moving, the camera suddenly shifts, and you find yourself going in some other unintended direction).  The graphics are sub-par.  The only good thing about this game is the cutscenes - they're first class.  But apparently, the budget for the game was spent on this feature alone, because the gameplay and graphics are awful.This should give you an idea of how bad it is.  I bought it yesterday, and attempted to trade it in today.  The guy at EB was so ashamed of how bad the game was, he refunded me the full price.\n",

      "It's not every day that I advocate video games becoming more derivative, but in the case of \"Jeopardy!\", I'll make an exception.I've played a lot of video-game versions of \"Jeopardy!\", which has gotten easier to adapt as video game technology has improved.  In the early 90's, the Sega Genesis version was a nightmare to play, as you had to spell out answers in their entirety with just a D-pad and three easily-confused buttons (for \"select letter\", \"delete letter\", and \"accept\").  Games took well over an hour to play and punished players who accidentally submitted incomplete responses by pushing the wrong button.  Worse, there was no way for the cartridge to remember which questions had already been used, so you always risked getting repeat questions, which killed the fun and novelty of the game.The CD-i version (of all things!) in 1995 was a breakthrough by substantially solving these problems.  First, it had a list of \"completions\", so after entering a few letters of your response, you could see it matching an alphabetical list of possible answers, and just arrow over and pick the completion.  This dramatically sped up game play.  The other fix was that the game could use the small (8KB?) built-in memory of the CD-i player to log which questions had already been used, effectively eliminating repeat questions.  With the copious CD storage, it was also possible to read the questions aloud -- while not necessary, it was a nice touch.  The only flaw was that the controller 1 had a clear and obvious advantage over controller 2 when ringing in.The PlayStation \"Jeopardy!\"s polished the \"completion\" system of the CD-i version, and saved the question usage stats to the memory card.  In other words, it didn't fix what wasn't broken... it just took \"Jeopardy done right\" to a wide audience than would have seen the CD-i version.And now, the PlayStation 2 version arrives with this history of \"Jeopardy!\" video game evolution behind it... and promptly proceeds to ignore it.  While it uses a sensible completion system for entering answers, it makes the stunningly boneheaded move of NOT saving stats about question usage to the memory card, allowing repeat questions to appear at potentially any time (at least the Genesis version allowed you to reject categories you knew you'd already seen - Atari's PS2 version isn't even that smart).  What the heck were the Atari engineers and producers thinking?  Apparently, they were too focused on features nobody really needs, like having CPU contestants answer with actual audio replies instead of on-screen text (memo to Atari: nobody cares).Increasingly powerful systems should allow \"Jeopardy!\" to become more like the actual game show with each generation -- eventually, the game should be able to use a microphone and speech recognition technology to let players speak their answers aloud.  But more important than the technology is a basic competence and awareness of gameplay issues, of fun, that this game screws up with the single avoidable mistake of not logging question usage to avoid repeat questions.\n",
      "What were they thinking, porting one of the Greatest NES games of all-time Kirby's Adventure to the GBA!!! The music is wrong, the sounds are wrong, The gameplay is wrong, and the difficulty is easier! It coundn't have gotten worse than this. If your gonna make a port atleast leave the game as it was and try to get the name right or it will ruin the game for everyone!!! They shoud have came out with a totally new Kirby game for the GBA and brought this one to the GC in mayby something like a Kirby Collectors addition with games such as: Kirby's Dreamland 1,2,and 3, Kirby's Adventure,Kirby Super Star, Kirb:The crystal Shards, and more!!! Now that is a great idea!\n",
      "This game is one of the shortest games I've played - for those of you who like to play a long game with a lot of worlds - this game is not for you at all. But for those of you who like a really short game - hunting for treasure chests - and some comedy that rolls through out the game - then this is probably for you.\n",
      "This game looks weird without Mario. Besides your doing what wario allways does. Stealing treasure. I bet this will be hard.\n",
      "I love history, and I love RPGs, so it goes without saying I was anticipating &quot;Lionheart&quot; for a long time. The game has an interesting premise, and it uses Fallout's &quot;SPECIAL&quot; system.  I thought that Reflexive and Black Isle could not possibly screw up this great combination.  Boy was I wrong.  &quot;Lionheart&quot; is poor in every category.  This terrible game simply does not have one redeeming quality about it.To start off with, the 2-year outdated graphics are mediocre, creature and character animations stink, and the artwork is nonexistent.  Every screen is covered end-to-end in grey or black and has the visual appeal of an IRS 1040 form or a dirty ash tray.  You can let your imagination run wild with how exotic and cool Medieval Europe could have looked after a great big cosmic magical rift.  I say &quot;you&quot; could, because the designers for this game obviously didn't.  Where are the snow-capped mountains, exotic palaces, beautiful forests, and lakes?  They're in &quot;Divine Divinity&quot;, that's where.  &quot;Lionheart&quot; looks more like Wyoming after a great big forest fire.  &quot;Divine Divinity&quot; is but one game puts &quot;Lionheart&quot; to shame in the graphics department (and everything else as well).  All of the recent Dungeons and Dragons games look better than this, because of their exceptional artwork and creativity.  Even the flop sci-fi &quot;Harbinger&quot; looked better than this.But graphics don't really matter that much do they?  I guess not - I could easily ignore them, but the gameplay is terrible too.  The way that the turn-based SPECIAL system has been butchered in this game is inexcusable.  A real-time game that uses a turn-based system can succeed if you can pause the game to issue orders.  That is why real-time Dungeons and Dragons have been so successful.  However, this game has the mind-bogglingly stupid feature of NOT letting you do this.  You can pause the game, but not to issue attack orders.  There is no autopause feature that stops the game for you when someone rushes onto the screen.  The tactical genius and elegance that made Fallout's combat great is nonexistent.  That leaves you with a real-time, extremely low quality Diablo clone, complete with a red bulb for health, and a blue bulb for mana.  You left-click to attack, you use a hotkey to select your active spell, and then right-click to cast the spell.How groundbreaking.&quot;Diablo clone&quot; would be a compliment for &quot;Lionheart&quot; though, because the combat engine is pitiful otherwise.  Enemies are unoriginal and poorly animated.  You reveal the fog of war by exploring ugly areas and run into ugly, repetitive enemies bit-by-bit.  They simply yell out a &quot;raawwrrr!&quot; and rush at you at light speed, before you can cast more than one spell or fire an arrow from your useless bow.  If you specialize in ranged combat or magic, you literally will not survive the first area of this game, no matter how many times you reload.  This game is more unbalanced towards melee characters than &quot;Arcanum&quot; was.The game's intrusive interface blocks your view of the world by taking up almost a third of the screen, but it somehow still manages to be functionally inadequate.  (A dubious accomplishment).  You only get 7, that's right, 7 hotkeys for spells, and other actions.  Compare that with games like Neverwinter Nights, which made full use of the \"F\" keys for 36 total hotkeys.  Expect to find yourself casting the same few unimpressively-animated spells over and over.Needless to say, I did not finish this game, so I cannot comment about the story from start-to-finish.  However, I can say that the portion of the game that I played through offered no indication that it would be special.  &quot;I am some sort of mysterious chosen one, and some bad men want to kill me because of it&quot; is the basic premise.  A cliche storyline is nothing new, and some games are still great in spite of it, but it's not enough to make you want to toil through a game that is just plain bad.I wanted to love this game, but I can't.  I tried to like it, but I failed.  Reflexive alienated hardcore RPG fans by screwing up the &quot;SPECIAL&quot; system, and then screwed up the mindless action so that &quot;Diablo&quot; fans could hate it too.  I wish that I could say that it's a simple hack-and-slash adventure, but I can&quot;t, because the hack-and-slash aspects of the game stink.  &quot;Lionheart&quot; is by far the worst RPG that I have played since before Baldurs Gate, and I am thinking it might be the worst I have ever played.  A trashpile like this doesn't even deserve the bargain bin.\n",
      "It's low-brow humor at its easiest. Dick jokes, prostitutes, dog sex - it pretty much runs the gamut. If you're fine with that sorta thing, then definitely check BMX XXX out. The game itself is pretty bad, though. Not enjoyably bad, unfortunately. It does a subpar job of ripping off the Tony Hawk games released around the same time, and the graphics look several years out of date even for its release date in the early 2000s.\n",
      "If you took Dave Mirra BMX throw in some srtippers and the game sucked you'd get BMX XXX. This game mearly uses cheap gimmicks as way to make up for the crummy gameplay, most of the goals in the career mode are almost impossible to complete mostly because the game barely gives you enough information to figure out what your actually suppose to do. I admit the game does have its share of funny stuff but its not enough to keep me playing and the game videos aren't even worth the effort, if your only playing for the X-rated content your better of with the internet. How the game manage to warrant M rating still puzzles me.\n",

      "I remember buying this game and thinking, \"this is going to be another cool shooting game, kinda like Max Payne.\"  Well, I was completely wrong on both accounts.  This game is terrible, and it is NOTHING like Max Payne.  The graphics are some of the worst I have ever seen in a video game, even for the time period that this game came out in.  The controls are also some of the worst I have ever encountered.  The worst part of this game, however, is the plot/gameplay.  In short - there is no plot.  This guy just runs around killing things while his stupid pet does dumb tricks that a real dog would never do.This game is a cheap knockoff of Max Payne, and it performs poorly.  I would recommend sticking your head in the toilet over buying this game.  At least you can take a shower afterwards.\n",
      "I cant even describe how bad this game is, compare it to the first one and you have a choclate poopy mud stain in your PS2 collection. gameplay is repititive AND TOO EASY! dante never talks, and i liked him in the first and in the 3rd. if you want to get all devil may cry games do your self a favor and pick only 1 or 3. I have the game guide in may bath room...  but not for reading.\n",
      "What was Capcom thinking when they said THIS would be a GREAT idea!? Everyone must have been having a bad year to have created this monstrosity. We left the world of Dante with high hopes for the next installment of the DMC (Devil May Cry) series. We knew there was going to be another game and we welcomed it with open arms. Until we got it. This game is downright bad. Though the first game had hokey dialogue, just like this one, it made up for it in the level of excitement and badassery that was Dante. Now we got a Dante that has a slightly longer coat, the ability to run on walls like in the Matrix and a nonexistent level of cockiness.Dante, as a playable character, is not alone. We are forced to use a separate disc with this Lucia woman to get the grand scheme of the story. Each disc, individually, can be played through in about four hours (eight total), but the creators of the game expected you to switch back and forth between the two to understand what in the world was going on. I value my PS2 tray too much to be switching between the two like that so I played them separately and stitched together what I didn't know without a great stretch of my imagination. Simply put: the story was awful. Why Dante would even get involved with the young Lucia and the ancient Matier is reduced to the simple fact that demons are running amok. At the very least, in the first game, Dante was interested in participating in Trish's request because of her resemblance to his mother. There is only a promise of a story from Matier. So I have to run around battling demon tanks, buildings, helicopters, monkeys, aquatic tendrils, and a boss fight that is as easy as eating pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving for a story? ...I'd rather waste my time watching paint dry.If you're hellbent on playing it, play the Dante disc and just assume the storyline. There's no other reason to play this game except for a lingering sense of pride in the DMC series.\n",
      "Good lord, Capcom, what were you thinking when you released DMC2? I can't believe how dumb someone could be. Almost everything sucks, Dante isn't very hardcore anymore, the levels are too open(you can use guns to beat the game, seriously), it's too dang easy, and it's too dang stupid for it's own good. Capcom should be tortured for this. Devil May Cry 3 WILL be better than this. Believe me, I'm a big DMC freak.\n",
      "Well, I had beaten LOTR: The Return of the King  which was incredibly fun and had a great set-up.  So I decided to work my way backward through the games, starting with LOTR: The Two Towers.  Wow!  It was horrible, the graphics were much worse the LOTR: The Return of the King, I started and the intro where you learn how to fight was just sad.  It was the same buttons as before but it took forever for it to explain them all, and it was dull, nowhere to go, so you had to just sit there waiting for Orcs.  After what seemed like forever I moved onto the next scene.  The fighting was horrible, I could have taken \"The Nine\" in LOTR: The Return of the King but the combat in this game wasnt any good so the moves that happened so quickly before were slowed down to an agonizing rate!  I finnaly decided that if its going to be that bad now why sit here and deal with the whole game. I thought it would be much better than it was and I advise you to exclude this from your shopping list.\n",
      "this a horrible game. theres more bad stuf in the game than good.first off i did think that being able grab people as hostages was great.i also liked that he was alowed to say [profane words]. but if you ever notice most people face look the same in this game. also if you ever shoot at a window it doesnt break no sound nothing. the graphics are horrible they look like n64 graphics. and in some parts of the game u have to go jumping off edges and stuf com on thisis a shooting game not and adventure. also you cant really explore or go in another direction its just one way. everythings scripted and the peolpe know your here right away. like they know your supposed to go that way. the frame rate in the game is excelent cause the graphics [are bad]. and for a game that has great frame rate they should of atleast put a multiplayer like 007 cause its smoothe like this game. but they didnt. justsave your money its not worth it.\n",
      "Avoid this one...I wondered about this game because I saw it cheap in a lot of shops. It looks like it could be interesting & fun. It's just a bunch of chaos. Pointless, random chaos all around you is not fun. Trust me. Whatever the \"mission\" was at the time, the fact all these mindless \"AI\" (I use the term \"AI\" loosly here) are running wild in seemingly infinite numbers ruins the point of gaming. I got rid of it & the folks at the store I took it back to were like \"I feel you\".\n",
      "I have owned this game for 3 days now and even though I'm told it's a short game, I can't get through it. I keep getting killed and instead of starting over from my own save spot like most other games, in this I have to start the whole chapter over again. This sucks as some of these are long and take a while to get back to where you were killed. This is more then just an annoyance but should be outlawed in game making. This does nothing more then frustrate and make a gamer angry. And if the game is a good one, it's bad enough but this is a lousy game to begin with and just makes me much madder and much more frustated that I ever bought the stupid thing to begin with. The graphics are terrible, the artwork is amateur, the story lame and the sounds, well, terrible!This game is so forgettable and such a huge waste of time that I can only kick myself over and over for being stupid enough to buy it, but I, like many others, was thinking that it would be a decent game like it's predessor.Red Faction, the first, was not a great gane but it was fun and worth playing. It was not even close to being a favorite or even worth playing again but the price was right and I felt like it was a fair deal. This one feels like I got completely ripped off! I was cheated and I have nobody to blame but me for not reading the reviews first. Live and learn. Just because the 1st game is good, don't figure the 2nd one will be as well.You would think the makers of this would have wanted to keep the buying customers happy and make sure the second one was a good one. They blew it! And now they have their new one coming out. The Gorilla and I will be reading alot of reviews before plopping down my money again. Don't buy this one and check the next one real good.\n",
      "I have written and rewritten this review, and this is my final offer. Any would-be buyers of this game, PLEASE take this as a caveat; I really want to convey just how lousy this game is. Any comparison of this game to the rest of the series is ludicrous, but anyway...As I said before, you play the game as the character Ryu, a government grunt. Mankind has been forced to live under the earth due to reasons lost in antiquity, and the citizens are placed into their positions via a rating system (a ratio - the closer the ratio is to 1, the more potential a person has, and thus the greater station this person is allowed to have). Surprisingly, the higher your ratio, the closer to the surface you are allowed to live, despite the conviction that the outside world is poisonous. Anyway, the purpose of the game is to climb out from the bowels of the earth in an attempt to reach the sky. This is the story. If you find it excellent, well, to each his own, but personally,I don't think this tale stands up to the likes of Xenosaga, .hack:infection, Suikoden III, FFX, etc.However, complicating matters is the D-Hunger gauge, against which I have railed in the past. As you progress through the game, this gauge constantly rises (increasing about 1/100 of a percent every 2-3 seconds on its own). SHould your character transform into a dragon (or use other special abilities), the rate of increase rises dramatically. Assuming you never use ANY of these abilities, however, you essentially have 20000-30000 seconds to finish your game (or about 6-8 hours). Failing at this, it is game over. In fact, you have to restart your game from the beginning. There is NO carrying over of statistics; what CAN be carried over are the weapons and armor you have equipped, any items you have stored away, the skills you have learned and \"party experience\", which can be used to boost your characters upon the replay. Furthermore, if you are considering beating the game on your first go around, don't. It is physically impossible (I know, I tried it out). I have a lot of words to describe this atrocious system, but \"realistic\" isn't the first to come to mind.I believe in innovation, when it makes a game more fun. However, this is absurd. You want the trick to beat the game? Simply play through as far as you go twice, remembering to store all of your acquired items and NEVER use party experience. That way, on your third time through, you can buff up your characters so much that they will destroy any enemy they come across (yes, I decided to go back and finish the game). Hence, an 8 hour game becomes a 24 hour game, since every scene is seen three times. The fact that you can't save often is a blessing in disguise - saving doesn't really help you anyway (the D-Hunger gauge isn't going anywhere). Oh, and for a more \"realistic\" gaming experience, notice that you have a \"quit\" command. This command essentially allows you to save at a certain spot, and then use you dragon abilities to try to acquire certain skills and items you might not otherwise be able to acquire. Oh sure, you'll die, but you can start over at the save spot, with all of the abililities now in your repertoire. In fact, the guide (which may be the most useless instruction guide in all of gaming, oftem times confusing me more than instructing me) tells you to use this strategically. The realism is overwhelming. The moral is: if you try to beat the game on one walkthrough, forget it! Instead, the system rewards ineptitude over ingenuity.If you are one of those (sad to say many) people who simply cannot stand the mainstream, and would sooner gouge out their eyes than play a game everyone else is playing, this might be for you. To be sure, the system is innovative, and I am sure it will never rear its ugly head again. However, if you enjoy fun game, or if you simply don't want to waste fifty bucks on a stinker, stay the hell away from this abomination. Play Xenosaga (another innovative game), or .hack, or even Final Fantasy X for the nth time. This game reeks...\n",
      "the only thing good about this game was the staying power of nina and ryu. this game was awful from start to finish.as a HARDCORE &#34;BOF&#34; fan since the first game back in the 90's i can say this is by far the worst they have ever made and its no wonder this game was the ending of the series. they should have kept a good thing going while they had the chance. anyone who plays this game before any of the others will most likely never choose to play another BOF game again\n",
      "I am a huge RPG fan and there aren't many games that I haven't played. I am also a quite a fan of BofF but I was very disappointed. I had to restart from the beginning of the game 3 times because I couldn't find any save token for the last 1/3 of the game.  I had to let the PS2 run for 3 days because I couldn't find any save tokens. It Sucked!!!!! Especially when your girlfriend tripped over a power cord and had to restart again!!!!!!Although Capcom had newer battle tactics and different try out for this game, you were limited with only 3 characters through out the game and you had to finish the game with a charcter who kept dying on every boss you face.If you are a truly huge fan of BofF and have to play this game, it's an interesting game. However, if you just want to try this game, please don't buy it. Just rent it...\n",
      "Despite teasing players with potentially intricate themes, such as political subterfuge, rebellion, and betrayal, the story - lynchpin of any great RPG - of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter never strays too far from its premise. Where plots are generally uninteresting, it is left to the characters to enrich the experience by allowing players to identify with them through the course of their development. Unfortunately, beyond the fact that Ryu actually has a personality in this installment, the characterization is as shallow as a wading pool. Once each of the three characters has established their role (and you guessed it, there are only three), the story drags towards an uninspired conclusion...Players will reach that ending in 15-20 hours, or perhaps twice that amount, depending on their tolerance for repetitive dungeon crawling and agonizing play mechanics. If innovation means taking traditional turn-based combat and throwing most of it out of a window, including all of its good qualities, then Dragon Quarter has accomplished just that.The combat system is very limited. Ryu can only do sword attacks, none of which is anything spectacular; horizontal, vertical, and diagonal slashes, some enhanced by fancy effects, comprise his entire repertoire. Nina can only do magic; the usual arsenal of fire, ice, and lightning spells. Rin can only do gun attacks that with the exception of a few, all look the same, but have a variety of strategic effects.Roaming bland dungeons and engaging in tedious battles comprises the whole of Dragon Quarter's gameplay. Still, there a few details that need to be mentioned. One of the defining elements of the Breath of Fire series is Ryu's ability to transform into a dragon. It is also often the most exciting part. Unfortunately, consistent with the rest of Dragon Quarter, that ability is watered down, unimpressive, and does very little to ease the player's suffering.In terms of visuals, the game's objective seems to be adequacy, but never to venture as far as to be awe-inspiring. The character models are bland and, the animation isn't even noteworthy. The backgrounds are either sterile corridors reminiscent of hospitals, gritty metallic platforms, or at their best, lavish medieval-style halls. This lack of diversity creates a feeling of insufferable redundancy.Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is one of the most boring, trite, unfulfilling gameplay experiences in recent memory. Beware of a game that advertises \"healing potions\" on the back of the box; it may just be that such a trivial element is actually a highlight next to the rest of the features.\n",
      "I bought this game thinking it would bear a slight resemblance to the other games in this series which I loved.  However, I found this game to be frustrating to the extreme.  I couldn't even get past the first mission due to the goofy save system which punished you every time you died.  The only way to save is to use a save token, which apparently appear randomly after defeating enemies. My brother-in-law had also bought it and hated it for this reason, and also because of the dragon meter feature.  Evidently, there is the ability for your main character to transform into a powerful dragon.  The only problem is, every time you do so, it adds to the dragon meter, which, once full changes your character into a dragon permanently, and then GAME OVER!  Why even put that stupid thing in there?  Why do game designers have to make saving such a chore?  I want to be able to save anywhere I please, at any time.  We aren't popping quarters into a machine, so what's the point!?I really wanted to like this game, and I believe it would have been really good if the save system were user friendly, and if they'd left out that ridiculous dragon meter.  I have never in my years of gaming (about 20) been this frustrated with and RPG, and that's my favorite game genre.So, in conclusion, unless you're a serious masochist, steer clear of this game!  Consider yourselves warned.\n",
      "Just hated it not anything more to say about then that .  Why bother to. Make such a bad game I don't know .\n",
      "There was like a million resident evil games and which more are coming out. What's the concept. Go around kill zombies, Takes forever, and don't be goin over your friends house to watch him play this because you'll fall asleep after your tenth heart attack after drinking soda. We were at my friends birthday party and all he did was sit there and play this until we flipped out on him and begged him to do something more social.\n",
      "Ridiculous...you can buy a Playstation for 15 bucks, and a RE2 game for only 7 or 8 bucks at any store. This is a pathetic attempt to capitalize off of idiots. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!You can buy it for N64 for a very cheap price as well, and the graphics are the same. As far as I know they didn't really change anything about this game. I just cannot believe they are chargine so much money for this, RE3, and code veronica-X, unbelievable. This is a great game, if you buy it for PS1/PS2, or N64. I would rather play it on PS1 anyway, it has a more classic, old school feel to it. Anyway, if you are dumb enough to actually dish out 55-200 bucks for this game, be aware you are ripping yourself off.\n",
      "First off: The Gamecube ports of RE2, RE3 and RE Code Veronica are not meant for vets who played them already on Playstation or Dreamcast. These are for newcomers to the series, Gamecube owners who started off with the REmake and RE0. Ignorant vets will be disappointed at the lack of new content.I became an RE fan in the spring of 1996 when the first game in the series was new. I loved it and I couldn't wait for the sequel. When RE2 was finally announced, many fans were disappointed that it had two entirely new characters instead of reusing the characters from the first game. The director explained that every RE game had to have new characters, because the previous characters had already been through their share of horrors and were now hardened by them. I agreed with him 100%. So later when RE3 was announced and Jill from RE1 was the main character, that seeded my disdain for the game. It disappointed me that the creator didn't have the balls to stick to his guns, because he was right. Later I came to accept the rehashing of previous characters in RE games, but this was the first one to do it, and it annoyed me.Eventually the game came out and I bought it. Another irking detail niggled me right out the gate; RE3 has no \"normal\" difficulty setting, which is what I always play my games on when given the choice. In this game, you have to choose between easy or hard. Easy is insultingly easy and hard is harder than I like. However, RE3 does have some great gameplay innovations such as the gunpowder based ammo creation system, and the defensive dodge move, which I really wished they'd put into all following games in the series. There are also several points where you have to choose between two possible actions, and the choice you make does have an effect on what happens next. The puzzles are fairly standard for an RE game.RE3 does nothing to further the storyline. It's a complete sidetrack. I've always personally considered Code Veronica to be the true sequel to RE2, and RE3 to be a 'gaiden' (sidestory). Recently it's come out that this is the official truth, and the only reason Code Veronica wasn't given the title RE3 was because of the business relationship (or perhaps even actual contractual obligations) between Capcom and Sony. In some cases I would argue that if the gameplay itself is good, the story doesn't matter. But the fact is, RE1 set up Umbrella as the ultimate evil jerks who needed to be taken out, and RE2 did precious little to bring us closer to that goal. By the end of RE3, you're in exactly the same place RE2 left you, no closer to taking down the bad guys. Code Veronica, on the other hand, does indeed finally take the fight directly to Umbrella. And while I'm on the subject, I really have to question the wisdom of having RE4 take place in a world where Umbrella has already been taken out completely. That's one pleasure that DEFINITELY should have been given to the player.To sum up: I'm an RE vet of eight years and I don't recommend RE3.\n",
      "Tao Feng is a below average fighting game. It's best feature is the limb damage and nice graphics, but everything else in the game is a miss. the controls are sluggish. You'll notice a slight delay when you press the buttons to the character on screen responding to it a second later. Sound effects are weak and you can barlely hear the smacks. The novelty in this game is that when you block attack too much you can have limb damage in your arms or legs. You'll see the characters limping and do less damage when they attack. But they can repair their injuries when they do combo moves on you, which defeats the whole purpose of \"limb damage\". The fighting techniques are uninspired and lack that extra -oomph-. The character's animation look a bit stiff and lack fluidity which other fighting games have. In addition to the stiffness, the characters are very ugly looking. They look like platic action figures and have a bunch of tattoos on their bodies. There are only a few fighting arenas and they are mostly dark settings. There is only a few unlockables and they are not satifying. There are better fighting games outthere, save your money for those.Pros:+nice graphics+good sound effects+limb damageCons:-ugly character designs-uglier music-unresponsive controls-combos are hard to pull off-difficult to block attacks-short game-weak animation-dark looking arenas-lacks intensity-fighting techniques look generic\n",
      "Ok, I read many reviews and was shocked how much people like this one. I loved Silent Hill and Even More love for Silent Hill 2. So The series was moving ahead full speed then this crap came out. The problem starts with the series changing to a female lead character. If you notice they only did it once and then when back to white males as the role. Female as a lead just didnt work, and an ugly as hell one at that. Now that is for me (which before the sex battle begins I loved resident evil 3 with Jill it just doesnt work for silent hill series), it didnt seem to bother some of the other reviewers. Next Problem is the religious crap they stuff down our mouth. It was present a little in the first but this was like 90 percent in this one.The storyline felt like left over ideas that werent good enough for the first 2. Either way they atleast got back on track with Silent Hill 4. Skip this one.Con-Storyline-Female Lead-Boring-Monsters-Everything that made the first two not in this onePlus-I think THe Goriest In THe Series-Vincent was a nice add character (felt like he was a silent hill character)All in all, I pawned this game. Kept Silent Hill 1,2,4,Origins. Silent hill 5 and Remake arent any good either. But they are another story. High Hopes for Silent Hill Downpour. Hope this helps.\n",
      "Minimum system requirements state QuickTime 6.0 -- but it doesn't tell you that a newer version of QT will make it impossible to play properly. On mine, all the characters displayed as big white boxes. According to Ubisoft support center: \"This problem can occur if you have installed a newer version of Apple's Quicktime software.  Unfortunately, the only way to resolve this issue is to uninstall Quicktime from your system, and then reinstall the version of Quicktime included on the game disk. \"I prefer NOT to downgrade my software just to play a game, so I uninstalled this game. No doubt, the newer versions of this game don't have this flaw (at least, I'd HOPE not!)Barbara\n",
      "\"Will Rock\" came out at roughly the same time as \"Serious Sam\" originally did, and fell into that same general category...  a \"brainless shooter\" where hoards of enemies swarm you and you have to wipe out massive numbers of enemies.  It's not a \"special\" game, but it's quite a bit of fun to play.  The storyline, such as it is, is that you're the \"avatar\" of an Olympian \"god,\" channeling that god's powers to battle against a variety of enemies who are trying to defeat that god.  You become the \"avatar\" during the opening of the game, and while you're in control, you get special powers and abilities which come directly from Mt. Olympus.The enemies and scenarios are appropriate for that period of time.  Unlike \"Serious Sam,\" the game's lead character is reasonably serious, but the enemies do tend to be more than slightly humorous in how they operate (the roman soldier skeletons move in an amusing \"high-step\" for example).All in all, it's a fun game.  Forgettable, but fun and worth playing.The problem is...  about half of the time, even at the date of release, and probably moreso today, the game simply will not run.  It's well-known that this program used the \"Safedisk\" so-called \"copy protection\" scheme (which, of course, never prevented a single \"pirate\" from ever making an illegal copy, but DID prevent many, many legitimate users from being able to run the program).  Safedisk uses a \"blacklist\" as one of its elements, and if you have any example of \"blacklisted\" hardware or software on your machine, the program simply won't run at all.What might be \"blacklisted?\"  Oh, any optical drive capable of burning disks, just for one example.  Or the program \"process explorer\" which allows you to see what's running on your machine at any time (and acquired by Microsoft and provided for free download on their tech website).  Or...  well, the list just goes on and on and on.I have multiple machines, and I've only ever owned one machine on which this program would even run.  None of my contemporary ones will run the program.It's a shame, because the program itself is a lot of fun.  The DEVELOPERS did a fine job.  But they made the mistake of going through the publishing house \"Ubisoft,\" a French company which is widely reknowned for using the most draconian and intrusive \"copy protection\" schemes out there.You'll notice I put \"copy protection\" in quotes.  This is because these schemes have never... not ONCE... actually prevented a \"pirate\" from stealing the application or installing it for free.  However, they HAVE repeatedly prevented legitimate, paying customers from being able to use software paid for...  WHICH IS CRIMINAL ON THE PART OF UBISOFT, since they have never once offered to refund the purchase price of any item which was disabled by their so-called \"copy protection.\"I'd sure like to be able to run this.  The reason I'm writing this review is that I recently did a minor upgrade to my machine, and did a clean OS reinstall as a result.  I'm running XP Pro SP3 (32-bit).  The only way I can get this program to run is to remove my twin BD-burners and replace them with ancient non-writable CD-drives, as well as to remove many, many applications (Nero, for example) which I regularly use.This is not unique for Ubisoft.  They used an even worse \"copy protection\" scheme for the later \"Assassin's Creed\" games which prevented legitimate purchasers from using their legally-bought-and-paid-for software, and Ubisoft has steadfastly refused to make good on their LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE WORKING PRODUCT OR TO IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE A REFUND IN FULL.Ubisoft is, simply stated, CRIMINAL.  They are scum, they are filth, they don't deserve to remain in business, and frankly, their senior leadership ought to be prosecuted.  And I'm not saying that out of emotion... it's actually a reasoned, calmly stated opinion.In the case of \"Will Rock,\" they disabled a perfectly good, low-end but \"fun\" game.  The game is good... and worth playing.  But I STRONGLY recommend you avoid buying it, for the reasons stated above... and I strongly recommend you avoid buying ANYTHING from Ubisoft for that same reason.In general...  \"Ubisoft\" means \"will prove to be a hassle to run and will, sooner or later, become impossible to run, even if you manage to get it working at first.\"Every item I currently have which has a \"Ubisoft\" label on the software, today, I have to run using a \"cracked\" version.  I'm no pirate.  But I've had no choice, because EVERY Ubisoft item I own causes such severe problems that the only way to reliably run them is to strip out the publishers \"added on\" so-called \"copy protection\" and run the game as the original developer provided it to them.Remember...  the developers write the software.  The publishers package it and distribute it.  Ubisoft is not a developer, they are a publisher.  They took \"Will Rock\" (a program and associated media content), encrypted the EXE with a copy-protection system (not provided by the developers), put it onto a disk, put that into a box, and shipped it to stores.Thus, Ubisoft has hurt BOTH the end-users (ie, you and me) and the people who did the actual work (the developers).I would recommend this game if it could be run.  But the odds of you getting it to run are slim to none if you have a modern machine, unless you're willing to do a LOT of work to strip out every fragment of \"copy protection\" in the game (and there are several tiers of that, mind you!)In short... if you buy this, think of it like a \"quick-play lottery ticket.\"  The odds are, you won't get a prize, but if you're fortunate, you may win something fairly inconsequential but still enjoyable enough.\n",
      "People here have compared Will Rock with the Serious Sam games. All I have to say is Will Rock has got nothin' Serious Sam.While the spectacular kill fest in SS nail you to you seat, WS has you yawning after an hour of tedious gameplay.Why. The games are similar in some respects, but SS has that certain je n'ais c'est quis that WS sorely lacks.\n",

      "Stay away from this game. It is poorly coded, patches are worthless and the price tag is [too much].  It's a perfect example of what EA Games does.

The game has continous serious errors which occur randomly and that is the worst experience I've ever had with any games. Just that this one is a lot worse.\n",
      "This is 2003, and I for one have completely had it with Westwood's ridiculously bad AI.  We took this kind of unit stupidity in 1992 with Dune 2 when the RTS genre was new, but when is Westwood finally going to wake up, smell the coffee, and realize that they can't just keep putting new graphics on the same game, give a minor gameplay tweak here and there, ignore the AI and corresponding strategy elements, and expect us to dutifully keep swallowing it and shelling out the bucks?What was the original C&amp;C's gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Until someone edges out a win because they clicked slightly faster, or the tiberium is done and a victory is squeaked in via attrition.  Now fast forward to 2003 and C&amp;C: Generals.  What's the gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Etc ad nauseum.This isn't strategy.  In fact the so-called &quot;Real-Time Strategy&quot; has never been about strategy at all...it's just a marketing term to give a very rote, very brain-numbing kind of gameplay more of a cerebral spin.  Well a lot of us tolerated that lack of strategy and AI, with the hope that as the genre matured, Westwood would have enough vision (if not common sense) to finally put in a worthy AI and make these games a truly fun, strategic challenge to play.  Well they never did, and with what we're seeing, it doesn't look like they ever will...all they do is spend all of their resources - ALL of them - on graphics.  The computer &quot;opponents&quot; and units are all as stupid as ever, and once you learn the units and the rote action, gameplay is also just as coma-inducing.  :PSave your money and your time.  You haven't just seen this before, it's practically all you've seen if you've followed Westwood games, and anyone expecting this game to finally start using the immense amount of potential computer intelligence available to us with modern PCs, will be very disappointed indeed.  &quot;C&amp;C: Generals&quot;?  More like Mindless Clickfest 2003.  Pass.\n",
      "First I'd like to say that Bioware is a great company that has released a lot of good stuff, and this problem is not their fault. The only thing they did wrong is to pick Atari as their publisher.You see Atari put copy protection on the CD by Securom, that pretty much either 1) locks up your computer after 5 min of play everytime, or 2)won't allow you to install the game. (Just go to nwn's forums to see how many complaints there are about this - nwn.bioware.com) I don't even understand why this is even on the cd since NWN is mainly an online game, it already verifies your game keys when you go online. Furthermore any pirate can bypass this with stuff like Alcohol Software. The only people this hurts are people like me who were stupid enough to buy this game. All the good reviews in the world won't help this game if you can't play it - all you'll do is hurt your wallet.Bottomline: unless you want to play russian roulette with your time and money (for some cdrom drives - it does work fine), buy any other game at Amazon - like Warcraft III's expansion instead; their copy protection doesn't lock up your computer. Trust me, you don't want to pay money to be an unpaid tester of alpha quality software.\n",
      "After the game installed it wanted me to register it.  At that point Windows Defender popped up and said it was known to be harmful so I closed the registration box.  I was able to open the game and proceeded to play the tutorial.  It seemed like a pretty fun game.  After getting through it I closed the game only to find another window had popped up.  This time it was my firewall saying it had blocked a transmission and did I want it to continue blocking.  I did.  At that point I just restored my computer to before the installation.I hate it when you buy a game and then find out that it installs spyware or malware onto your computer.  I don't have enough tech knowledge to know what sort of program is embedded with the game.  If anyone has more info I'd certainly like to know about it.\n",
      "A huge production budget couldn't save this abomination.  For one thing, the game feels cheap and there are very very few variations in gameplay.  for all it's vaunted separate campaign paths, it's still linear and moreover... BORING.Get Deus Ex or Max Payne.\n",
      "Warning! Even though you're a matrix fan, and want more matrix action,just watch the movies,don't get this game.It's a total rip!The action is soooooooooooo boring, and the car driving parts of the game is just lame,very lame.But there's a bright side to this game,and it's the movie clips.\n",
      "Should you get this game? The best answer is yes and no. For a Matrix fan this is a no brainer ~ your going to force yourself to put up with all of the game's faults. Not a die hard Matrix fan? Then your not going to miss much here.Some things to consider...1. This is a bad version of Max Payne.I had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the gun fights, the movement and aiming felt very jerky and unprecise.(You also have to run everywhere for some reason) This is quite the opposite of Max Payne, it only took me a few minutes to become quite good with the gun fighting.2. The hand to hand fighting is done quite well, but hard to incorporate into large battles.(Like when mobs of guards are in your way)3. The game can be played from the point of view of both characters, Ghost and Niobe.(just don't expect a huge difference, its just the same level from a different angle)4. The driving sequences are, well, not my favorite. Some people may find some joy to them, but I found them rather boring and poorly done.Overall the action was put together pretty well, I'm playing through the game since I'm a big Matrix fan, but I dont' think i'll do it a second time.Ok after finishing the game I'm going to give all you action fans a little advice out there - save your money.  The videos are nice, but not incorporated very well and they are..well the only reason I would see anyone forcing themselves to play this game.  Every department needs help in a major way.  Graphics have bluring and see through polygon problems, the sound is not very well done in EAX, even with the new patch.  I found myself driving and make huge turns at just the slightest movement, taking huge jumps off small bumps and landing smack into a wall-aggrivating.  And this was supposed to be directed by the brothers?  There is no real \"umph\" to the story, you just run around and shoot guards most of the time watching parts of the movie you could have guessed happened if you had just watched it in the theatre and the animatrix already.To sum it up, I've already uninstalled it and and reinstalled Max Payne so I could remember how a real game is made.\n",
      "The gameplay is the worst I have ever experienced. That is what totally ruins the game. I had to use the gamepad since there is no mouse control. And the reason why I purchased the game for the PC instead of the Playstation was to use the mouse. Anyway the control is terrible with the gamepad. The character does not point in the direction of the joystick movement, making it a pain to navigate. I made the mistake of purchasing this game based on reviews. I played this game for about 20 minutes before calling it quits.\n",
      "This game has GOT to be the dullest bore I've ever encountered.  And believe me, I've played a few.  And this is supposed to be the premier, the apex of the \"survival/horror\" genre?  Oh my God!!! I was too busy yawning to be even the slightest scared.  I FINALLY got to and wandered around the prison for a while trying to find stuff and finally said, \"Enough is enough\" and deleted this lame piece of tedium from my computer.  Look, if you're into traipsing around some town and it's various structures in the fog and dark, endlessly looking around for doors and hard to see items to add to your inventory and solving puzzles, which I hate doing, than this is the game for you.  The dialogue is awful, the story is pathetic, the combat is lame and I get more scared opening the door to kiddies on Halloween night for crying out loud.  I was getting so weary with this thing I finally downloaded a walkthrough just to end my agony and I still said to heck with this.  Life is too short.  I never felt so good freeing up space on my hard drive. After reading all the reviews about how scary this game is and after playing Doom 3, FEAR and Dead Space, which were scary, I was really disappointed with this game.  In fairness I must say I played the game on easy, easy on puzzles and easy on combat.  Maybe it's scarier on hard but I'm not going to hang around to find out.\n",

      "Purchasing Gladius, I was under the impression I'd be getting an RPG based on Ancient Rome, dealing with building a Gladiator school and the likes.First off, despite being called \"Gladius\" and dealing with Gladiators, it was completely ahistorical, with the brilliantly named \"Empire of Imperia\" apparently taking the place of Rome, and some generically \"Naundark\" or whatever named Barbarian kingdom perhaps taking the place of some Germanic tribes.Aside from a ridiculously stupid storyline which takes liberally from every random generic magical fantasy story having to do with constellations of the bear's womb, the magic of the Gods, enchanted items and broad sweeping remarks by old people about \"prophecies\" and \"destiny\" and all that boring noise, the sentiments of Ursula's (one of the main character) brother mirrors much of the players' sentiments as well: \"More talk... when are we going to get to some action?\"If you like Pokemon games for Gameboy, you'd likely love the battle system here.  It consists of taking very slow-to-pass turns walking on paths which render the field into a grid with big squares and limited movement.  Attacks consist of selecting the enemy, hitting \"Strike\", then playing a mini variant of something like \"Mario Golf\" with trying to hit a little bar right when it lands on red for a critical strike, or settling for the far larger part of the bar marked yellow.  This goes back and forth until someone wins.This makes up the action combat of the game, while the background economics are a complex sort of deal that is difficult to keep track of in itself.  I had no idea I had only hired a gladiator for one battle, and couldn't even check on her until I started a battle to select my fighters.This was a debacle of a game, and absolutely no fun at all unless you're willing to pay for a 3D highly stylized version of Pokemon...\n",
      "Basically, I think this game is really boring. Yeah it has good graphics, WOOPIDEEDOO! That still doesn't make up for the flaws. The gameplay is ok, but kind of confusing to learn at first. Once you learn the controls you can beat up goofy looking robots, OH BOY! If you like that, guess what, you get to do it the whole first half of the game! Then, you can fight more goofy-looking robots, because that's pretty much all you do. So if you like beating up lots and lots of robots, then this game is right for you, otherwise, I suggest you get as far away from this game as possible.\n",

      "For starters, this is my brother's game, but I tried it out for like, fifteen minutes, before I got so bored I turned it off. This game is a pointless shoot 'em up where all you do is run around shooting this or sawing that. It's entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the hands(or blades) of Ash's chainsaw. But it's only a matter of time before the gameplay becomes so redundant you have no will to continue playing because all you do is chop stuff up(and what's with the strip clubs everywhere?!).There ARE spells that attempt to add some depth to the game, but when the day is over, you're left with the same shoot and slash garbage you started with when you turned the game on. Anyone into these kind of games should check out the Hunter games instead. They have better variation in weapons, and you can play with a friend. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE unless they're a die hard fan of the Evil Dead series.\n",
      "I'm not an expert of Homeworld series, I've never played any of the games other than this one, and I know nothing about the storyline.  The intro video for Homeworld 2 really told me nothing more than these people called Hiigarans have found these things called \"Cores\", which an evil man wants for himself, and so he attacks and destroys many colonies of the Hiigarans because they won't give them up.  I wish I could tell more, but that is literally all that the intro movie tells you.Leaving it to more Homeworld-literate and informed reviewers to point out the flaws more in-depth, I'll simply tell from my point of view.The User Interface is an utter mess of details and menus and submenus and obscurely shaped objects without labels that you have to figure out what they do by clicking them.  It's incredibly difficult to deal with, and you have to figure out what the wire-frames of each individual ship is, otherwise you'll never figure out what ships you've selected in space, because they aren't labeled unless you hover your mouse over them.The gameplay is terribly uninvolving.  Due to the clunky controls, sight is a luxury not well spent on your own forces.  Scrolling tends to go either too far in or too far away.  You're either watching the ships too closely, or so far away you can't tell what they're doing.  Another irritating feature is in cases of emergency, when you have to rush your ships over to enemies, is that you must click for them to attack the enemy as they zip past, because if you miss, your cursor will get stuck in a two-dimensional movement circle which essentially forces you to move the ship somewhere on its same plane in only two dimensions.  Pressing escape resolves this, but it's still a severe deterrent in emergency situations.The tutorial goes from baby-easy, to completely batnuts insanely difficult, as you go from one mission where you fight off a few enemy bombers pestering your Mothership, to fending off meager attacks on your transports, to suddenly encountering a fleet of several frigates, dozens and dozens and dozens of fighters and bombers, and only seconds after you're supposed to destroy the enemy half the map away in a resource field.As the final sampling, the voice acting.  Aside from the female voice of the Hiigaran leader, it seems they only hired one man to do the voices for all the ships and characters.  And he does all of them in the exact same voice, lazy and monotone, even when his characters are about to die, sacrificing themselves to save you.All in all, I couldn't believe how intolerably flawed this game was.  It's just plain... bad.  I've never played any of the other Homeworld games, but I hope the first is better than this one.\n",
      "The graphics are improved, the engine is improved, the game play sucks.  No longer are you thinking about what to build, how to maneuver your formations and where to have them focus.  This is bigger picture, and I honestly think it takes most of the fun away from the old one.  If they only improved the originals graphics and added a few more ships and another great story.  This story is terrible, and almost non existent.  No book breaking down everything for you like the original had, no feeling of discovery, and none of the personal attachment or feeling of control you felt in the first one.  Formations have been replaced with types of doctrinalish tasks like Frigate Screen.  Instead of building your own formations out of whatever you liked and moving it how and where you liked, now you build fleets you have little control over.  Not gratifying.  You don't build individual units like you did in the first one, except on the frigate and above level.  Now you build little wings of 3 or so that do your bidding.  The worst thing they screwed up was the research.  No longer do you research for you fleet in general, now every ship must have a research facility installed on its actual superstructure (read: money invested in worthless technology you already own on another vessel to move on to the next stage...).  Lots of money spent on the R&D.  Nothing was simple about this game, and Sierra let us all down.  Great ideas like upgrades and disabling specific portions of enemy capital ships sound great in theory, but fail to turn into fun once the gaming starts.  If you never played the first one, maybe this will be satisfying, but I have my doubts.  Look elsewhere.  If you enjoyed the first one, don't bother with this one, look elsewhere.  Or stick with the original.  Think of it like the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies that you wish never existed.\n",
      "I was happy to see LORII was being made when it was first announced way back in 2001.  As soon as I heard the developers were going to defect to the RTS craze, I knew it was a lost cause.  There has been more RTS crap churned out than ever before..RTS SUCKS because you don't have time to strategize.  It's the same old boring repetitive crap.  Yet developers keep making the same garbage.LORIII was supposed to be realized in christmas of 2002, then spring 2003, then winter 2003, ugg, I can't remember how many times it was delayed.  You can tell the project must have been in total chaos.Word to the game developers...try making a game that actually requires thought and strategy.\n",
      "I bought this game one month ago, together with &quot;American Conquest Fight Back&quot;, if I liked the last one as top of the bunch, LOTR III is bottom.I'll try to sell my copy, and desperately look for an used copy of the first version.\n",
      "This is unbelievable. All the great things about the Lords of the Realm II have been removed and nothing good has been added.  Gone is the management of the territory resources, instead you simply assign a vassal to an area and they produce just one type of resources.  To make matters worse, you armies are produced automatically so you dont even get to choose your army types.  The battles start automatically but you are not even taken to the battlefield automatically so you can ened up missing the battle if you dont go there right away.  I read the other reviews but I thought the sencond one was such fun I should give this one a try.  Big mistake  save your money.\n",
      "I've been with this series since the beginning. The first one rocked, the lands were huge you got to do so much stuff. The second one blew, you played on itty bitty lands and it blew. So I figured that the 3rd would be a return to the first, man was I wrong it was like the 2nd but more land, but as a price taking care of your towns was gone, you just threw servant down on a land and boom your done, what the hell, then to top it off when you attack ajacent lands you can basically destroy the crap out of it but you can't take control of it, that's not cool.The only reason why I give it a star is because I like the graphics in the battle screens, but other than that this game belongs in a bargain bin, and the places that have it should pay you to pick it up.\n",
      "It's a trick, get an axe!  I just bought it.  Save yourself the heart-ache.  Sierra is obviously having some problems, and this is not pretty.  Just say, \"No.\"  Don't make me say I told you so.  Buy StarCraft by the same company.  Buy Lords of the Realm I, II, or the Siege Pack.  Try HomeWorld.  They didn't finish this game and released it anyway.  It is so bad, you'll just about cry.  Hint: If it was 1987, I'd give it a 4.  And, I'm not just writing for fans of first person shooters.  Oh, those people will climb the walls.  RTS people won't like this either.\n",
      "After a LONG wait and much excitment, Lords of the Realm III did NOT live up to the hype.  It has none of the personality that II did, and is a shabby game over all.  It certainly doesn't compare to Medieval Total War.  Skip it completely, save your money, and buy a copy of Medieval instead.  MUCH better game.\n",
      "As reflected in other reviews here, Sierra took out all the best parts of this series: managing the economy, delicate balancing of army, and even basic interaction with your cities.  They took out the castle choices and the cool little videos.  Even though the battle graphics were pretty basic in the prior games, it was unquestionably more engaging than the 3-D graphics but dull and incomprehensible battles in this game.  In addition to the inability to control individual troops, I have had fighters attacking the air and other clipping issues.This game is simply not fun, and made me want to fire up Lords II to remember what this series used to be about.Get Stronghold or Lords II for a much better game.\n",
      "LOTR2 was a classic game. LOTR3 should have expanded on the things that made LOTR2 good, but strangely removes all the interesting bits in managing your lands, and leaves you with kind of a weaker version of a &quot;Total War&quot; title.Everything happens in real time, which means armies *crawl* across the global map far to slowly. This would have been better handled as a turn based element. Not fun.Individual parcels of land don't seem to be anymore valuable than any other parecls of land. You don't seem to get invovled into that &quot;damn I really need that mine/deposit/wood&quot;. No choke points on the maps either. Not fun.Actual battles are frenzied, quick, and extremely hard to control. Calvary types can get arcoss the battle maps faster than I can even select my troops and get them into some sort of logical order. Not fun.There are many possible formations and stances for individual troops, but no logical formations for groupings of more than one troop type. I.e. if you select a troop of archers and a troop of pikemen for instance and tell them to march to a location, they march off as if the others didn't exist.  That means the faster moving archers arrive first and get wasted by melee types, then the pikes arrive, who engage the enemy melee types, but get mowed down by the enemy archers. Lightly armored ranged troops should fall in behind melee troops. Other games have been doing this for years now. Whats the problem? Not fun.Not too much point trying flanking with calvary either. The lighter faster troops arrive first, so you may as well just plough straight into them. My battle tactics have simply been to pause the game, select all troops, and direct them all to attack en mass at the center of the enemies ranks. Mindless. Not fun.Attacking castles is painful. You can't seige them as in LOTR2, you just attack with your current troops straight away. Troops scale the walls etc, but this combat seems buggy and confusing. Units appear to get get trapped up on the walls, and no quick capture the flag to end battles. LOTR2 is *much* better in this aspect.No skirmish mode. Yep. NO SKIRMISH MODE. Not fun.I'd suggest looking around for &quot;Kohan Immortal Sovereigns&quot;, or a &quot;Total War&quot; game over this one.\n",
      "Ok, I can say a little more.  A lot more actually.  Where to start?  I still consider LOTR2 to be one of the best games I've ever played.  The AI was dumb but it was a super fun game - 5 stars all the way.  I've patched and played this one now and would like to point out the following to anyone thinking this is going to be like LOTR2:1) No documentation!  The manual isn't even close to sufficient and online/on cd adds nothing.  This will be a recurring theme in my review.2) Heavy hardware required.  I'm running an AMD 2200+ (clock rate ~1800MHz), 512 DDR400, and a Radeon 9700 Pro with latest drivers.  I can watch the arrows move frame by frame during sieges with only 2 of their units fighting 3-5 of mine.  \"Recommended\" hardware is 1500MHz and a Radeon 8500.  Liars.3) To upgrade your castle you save money.  My money keeps getting stolen after saving for 30 real-world minutes.  They take almost all of it and I have no idea how or how to stop them (DOCUMENTATION!!!).4) You can accidentally downgrade your castle since they present inferior designs as upgrade options, yet still charging you money to do it.  There are no descriptions in the game or in the manual describing what different castles are capable of.  DOCUMENTATION!!!5) Hiring mercenaries is a guessing game since the in-game description simply tells you there title, like siege engineer, and says he \"does not serve you\".  No help in manual...getting tired of typing DOCUMENTATION.6) I accidentally clicked on an ally's territory with my army and was immediately at war, despite being 2 territories away and changing back immediately.  Stupid.7) You can't zoom in or out during battle, which means it's *very* hard to tell which troops you are facing.  The graphics are not that good despite being so hardware intensive.8) During a siege I decided to go around to the castle's back wall since the defenders were all ammassed on the front walls.  The defenders did not re-position themselves to meet me.  Even worse, Once I climbed the walls my guys just kind of milled about, ocassionally doing something I ordered them to...kinda.  Even worser (new word), once I was finally inside the courtyard, I could not target the defenders!  So I just sat there gaping while my guys stood right next to the defenders who had about 3 archers and killed all my guys.  I tried this a few times with the same results.9) You can't conquer outlying territories and annex them anymore.  You can devastate them, but you have to conquer the main castle, at which time you get all of the territories.  This took a huge element of the game away for me.10) As previous reviewers noted, all micro-management is gone.  You drop a merchant on to a piece of land and never come back.  Same with a peasant for food.  No control, no fun.  Maybe there are more options but there is no DOCUMENTATION!!!11) Attacking an army on the field is lame. If you set up two units to attack one unit from different angles, both your units just bee-line right for the center of the enemy unit anyway. Not anything like the cool tricks you could play with the Total War series. No usage of terrain or weather or anything.I work at a telco, I understand what tough times mean to a company but this is ridiculous.  Sierra has fleeced me and I'm angry.\n",
      "I pre-ordered this game the day it was posted based on how much fun Lords Of The Realm 2 was.  Unfortunately, everything that made LOTR2 fun wasn't in here.  The territory values, the farming, the battle sounds...all gone.  The siege system is laughable, and the AI for both your own unit movements and the enemy movements are terrible.Now I know why the price was $19.99...not worth it.\n",
      "If I could have give it negative stars I would have. Expecting an upgrade to Lords of the Realm II, what I/we got was a totally different game. IT's an RTS POS. Gone is all the fun of turn based micromanaging and playstyle. All that is left is what the Siege Pak of LOTR II gave us, battle battle battle, boring. There's lots better RTS games out there, heck you can get EMIRES DAWN of the MODERN WORLD for less than $20 on ebay now and it's 1000x better than this game. No demo, and I surely can see why, nobody would have bought it, except a few clicky babies maybe. I'm glad I had a seven day return policy, I only needed ONE though! This isn't even worth bargain bin $5 to me. I have too many GREAT RTS games than to play this. Heck MTW (Medieval Total War) is better. It's $20 or less also on ebay and probably here at Amazon.com also. This one's a dud. It's so much of a dud they won't let you say anything bad about it over at the official website forums. If you think I'm kidding go try. ;)\n",
      "I was looking forward to this game.  I absolutely loved Lords of the Realm 2.  I can pick it up and even play it today and enjoy it greatly.  Part 3 however is awful.  All of the fun parts of 2 are gone.  The battles are boring, and the graphics are really dated.  The game is full of bugs and is just not fun to play.  Playing the game once feels repetative.  This game has no replay value at all.\n",
      "I don't know why but I've gotten 2 of these things now (both used) and neither had the ability to hold onto a save file after the first 5 seconds of gameplay. I'm going to half to save my money and get a new copy for over $100 if I ever want to play it.\n",
      "Enough with the Pokemon stuff already.  It's a fad that died out a few years ago, yet Nintendo's making a sequel with some of the most dated graphics I've ever seen.  The series hopes to get young kids into the RPG genre, which is fine, but for them to keep at it this long is abseloutely pathetic.  They should have scrapped this project and focused on the new Golden Sun game, an RPG series that's actualy GOOD and requires DEEP THOUGHT.  I doubt anyone over 10 is playing pokemon anymore.  But those who are should try to expand their intrests.  Maybe try a \"T\" rated RPG and see how much more comlex and interesting it can be.\n",
      "When Ocarina of Time for N64 came out, people were blown away.So naturally, when gamecube was released, people expected another great Zelda with realistic 3D graphics, and to everyone's shock (and to some's horror) Nintendo's next big Zelda was announced to use cell-shading technique, which provides cartoonish graphics for video games.I too was surprised to find this change, but nonetheless bought a copy at full price because, hey, it's Zelda. Soon my doubts cleared and I had a blast playing this masterpiece.To people that played Ocarina, this game will bring back the memories as it features many of the same sounds, music, and controls that were used in the N64 version. And although the cell-shaded graphics wasn't what people expected, it fits perfectly well into the atmosphere of the game, and once you get used to it you'll love it so much.When Wind Waker first came out, there were some critics that called this game childish and said it was a bad installment for the whole franchise. But time proved them wrong. The only childish thing about this game, if at all, is the difficulty which has been tuned down a lot compared to the N64 Zelda. Wind Waker is such a good game that it has even become my new favorite Zelda of all time, and that's saying a lot since most of the Zelda games are of grade A++.However, everything will soon change, at least I hope. The now-being-developed game of Twilight Princess has apparently made quite an impact on people that played it in E3, and now even the Cell-Shading hater can't say nothing to Zelda because it is gonna be as real as anything, like the code name for the project indicates, REAL ZELDA. Yes Link's body is gonna be proportional again in the next installment, yay?!Nintendo is really taking their time on Twilight Princess(years!! It was supposed to come out in 2005 but they decided to postpone it to make it even greater????) so it will undoubtfully be another masterpiece. If it's as good as Wind Waker you know I'll buy it. But I have a feeling that I will again be surprised =]Phhhh I try to keep my expectations at sane level but it's getting harder\n",
      "I had loved the Zelda series, but was dismayed when I saw Wind Waker. The cartoonish graphics look childish and amateurish. I nonetheless decided to rent the game and give it a shot. However, I gave up after a half hour or so. It just wasn't fun and wasn't worth my time.\n",
      "I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly bored. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again.  Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a &quot;puzzle&quot; game. I call it a BORING game. I suggest you buy a Mario game, which cleverly combines puzzle with action.\n",
      "Ugh, that is the most dumbest game! I loved Zelda: Ocarina of Tim and Majora's Mask. They looked great for the N64. But I was also baffled by the myster pick they showed in magazines. When this cartoon load ...came out, I screamed and hid under my bed. Link (the real one) was supposed to be in it. Not some bobble head little thing. The graphics where good, but I wanted Resident Evil looking Link and Ganondorf. Oh, Ganondork looks like he is 6000 years old, not hip and 30 like the older ones. The King of Red Dragons mouth was dubbed badly it looked dumb. STILL NO VOICE TALENT! I could understand why on the N64 they couldn't talk. But on the GCN, look at the other games! They talk! Why can't Link?! Oh and don't forget that bobble-head can't say a sentence. ...\n",
      "What happened to Zelda?  Where did it go?  What am I babbling about?  Well, I'd love to explain to you all the problems I had with this game, but unfortunately, I can only use a certain number of words for this review, so I'll cover all the main problems I had with it.First and most important is the ending.  The ending was depressing for anyone who's ever played a Zelda title.  Changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about 5 times better.  I won't tell you what it was, only that it was TERRIBLE.Secondly, the Gameplay barely existed.  I found that half the game was spent doing NOTHING.  I just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination.  The other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy, no five-year-old would fail at them.Storyline-wise, this game is a flop.  It contains only one realistically-behaving character; Ganon.  The rest of the characters are the product of plot holes, and are moved along BY the story, not the other way around.  Big problem in any game these days.The graphics annoyed me, but only because the character models were very ugly.  And as for the music, it just seemed incongrous very often.Plus, none of the characters talk!  On the GCN!  That's laziness to the umteenth power from a game-design perspective.Still, although I thought this game was a piece of garbage, there are those who found it fun, so I would be being unfair to say it is IMPOSSIBLE to like this game, despite all the huge, gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases.  To make everyone happy, I reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not you'll like it.  Don't make the mistake of buying it right off the bat like I did.\n",
      "I don't mean to crash anyones party but this game sucked... Its nothing like the other Zelda games.... I LOVED the origenal Zelda the best... And I liked all the others because they where based on the origanal, but this one is a totally diffrent story... it shouldn't have the opertunity to be have \"Zelda\" in its title. If they would change the green outfit (the only thing linking it to any of the other Zelda games) No one would even know it was sapposed to be a Zelda game.\n",
      "Let's see; bad graphics: Check! Music I'm not into: Check! Too long and frustrating: Check! Good luck trying to beat this kid's game in the same week you get it, because this is much harder than the first. 0/999 quadrillion\n",
      "Zelda is the most over rated game series ever made. And Wind Waker is the worst Zelda game made. First of all i will just start talking about how bad the graphics are. What we are looking at here are 2D Pixel Shaded Graphics. I can possibly understand these graphics for a racing game, or possibly a fighting game. BUT NOT AN ADVENTURE GAME. Yes Ocarina of time was OK, but not good enough to save this series. Wind Waker completly destroyed it. Link looks and talks like a complete loser. But you may say graphics arent everything. I can agree with that SOMETIMES, but when they are as horrific as these, i cant even play the game. Now the story and gameplay. Can u hit Z and press the A button multiple times? Well then you can beat Zelda Wind Waker. The game is meant for kids, no doubt about that. There is a talking Ship FFS. What is going on here nintendo?!?! I think you get my point on why windwaker sucks. The main things are that the graphics suck, and the game is easy, boring, and just plain stupid.\n",
      "i am pimp daddy king of all that's good and nasty!this game sucked i barely see the point of this game. o u rescue your sister  whoop de freaken do. i would'nt rescue my own sister[i'm just kidding about that i think] the graphics are awful like construction paper. DO NOT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TRY THIS GAME.\n",
      "Freelancer can't seem to figure out what kind of game it is.The marketing says it is a game directed by the way you play. In practice, it has a very linear plot that you are railroaded into following.If you want to play as a trader or miner, the marketing says it will support you. In practice, combat is thrust upon you so freqeuntly that you have little choice but to get a ship built for war.The marketing says it has role-playing elements. In reality, it is an action game with cut-scenes showing the plot.It is too simple to be a great space combat sim, but the combat is too hard for it to be an RPG. The choices are few and usually binary. I wanted Morrowind in space. I got frustration and disappointment.\n",
      "This was listed as a new product, however I received it and it was not in factory packaging.  It should have been listed as USED and not NEW.  I didn't want a &#34;like new&#34; product, I wanted a factory sealed copy.\n",
      "Kung-Fu Chaos has you fighting in arenas where you can ring out, or use objects like tables, chairs and even people to toss at your opponent. Up to four people can play simultaneously or you can play by yourself one-on-one. You can also team up with BOTS to fight against the cpu. The game has very cartoonish looking graphics, the sound effects and dialog are corny like an old Kung-Fu movie. In fact, you are playing inside a kung-fu movie. You'll hear the director telling you what to do and making snide remarks when you make a mistake. The whole game is silly and feels very childish. Not my cup of tea! I'm shocked that it got lots of good reviews here.Pros:+funny+instant replay+up to four players+play with BOTS+okay for kidsCons:-unresponsive controls-cheap sound effects-thinks it's funny-BOTS are stupid-nobody ever dies-limited attack moves-gets old fast-stupid music-retarded and pointless gameplay-small fighting spaceI feel sorry for the people that bought this gamefor themselves and lost money.

      "Its just a useles game disc but a nice frisbee. The game needs an xbox live gamer tag to play, plus this game wont work on the 360 and if your aware there is no way to make a gamer tag on the original xbox so this game is obsolete. But you can get the gamecube version which is alive and strong. DONT buy this from any seller. I found this out the hard way and its my own fault.\n",
      "I wanted to like this game in a bad way. However, the lack of checkpoints, in-game saves and having no clue how to get out of the first level turned this game into a total headache.\n",
      "Oh, where to begin. This game is rotten to the core. Everything that can possibly, literally go wrong with a game is crammed into this mess.It's nothing to do with RoboCop. Nothing. This game seems like an abandoned Wolfenstein or Duke Nukem game from 1995 (the dated horrible graphics indicate this right away) that has had a tiny, tiny bit of RoboCop pasted into it order to repackage it and get it out there are soon as possible.It should never have been allowed to get out there in the first place. The game is absolutely RIDDLED with bugs. There are dozens of things that RoboCop needs to do but the programming won't accommodate. Such as getting stuck in a location or walking up stairs or opening doors. The bad guys have no AI at all and end up firing at walls most of the time. They all look the same (guy in shirt with gun) and are really boring to shoot.RoboCop's gunfire sounds like a Commodore 64 sound effect. And since when did Robo say 'Oh yeah!' or 'Bullseye' when killing someone? And why oh why is a giant mutated rat in a supposed RoboCop game?The gameplay is terrible. The targeting system is rubbish (Robo will automatically target energy/ammo pick-ups and bad guys at the same time. Which is which? It happens too quick and it is useless too). I would have preferred the targeting system Robo has in the movies but here we get rectangles highlighting the bad guys. It looks stupid.The music is trash too. I would play with the volume turned down. Or not play it at all. This game should never have been allowed out. Shame on Titus and Virgin Interactive for producing such a travesty.\n",
      "Never got a chance to play it. I have been playing some xbox games on the xbox 360 but this one unfortunately did not want to play so I don't know if it's a good game or not.\n",
      "I just don't get it. GameBoy is just trying to make a quick buck. I bet you that within the next year there's going to be a GameBoy Advance SP Turbo or something. How long is it going to take for them to quit putting out new models that have all the same capabilities except for a light or the shape or something dumb like that, and really sit down and take some time to try and put out a decent model with decent graphics. The sound is useless because you mostly just hear music, which is the same 30 second tune played over and over. I have to admit, the quality of the graphics have improved since GameBoy Color, but barely improved since GameBoy Advance. There are nowhere near the amount of levels that you can play on PS2 or Xbox or even GameCube. Mostly not even half. In conclusion, GameBoy is not all it's cracked up to be. I'm sorry if you don't agree but that's my honest opinion. So, save a quick buck and buy a video game console instead. (PS2 is the best, then Xbox, then GameCube) So in a nutshell, if you have regular GameBoy Advance, there's really no need to get GameBoy Advance SP Platinum.\n",
      "I just bought a GBA a month ago. I figured when I bought it that I would be able to SEE the game I was playing. Silly me. Now I hear GBA SP is coming out and it has a light. I can't return the GBA I just got back to the store so I'm stuck with an inferior product...\n",
      "I wanted a nice looking one in spite of it being used. I accidently ordered one that was acceptable rather than like new. recommend to someone who doesnt care how it looks just so it works.\n",
      "I admit, I'm not really all that interested in first person shooter, so I don't play Medal of Honor or any of those games, but I was a huge fan of the original Wolfenstein games that came out centuries ago, and I am also a big fan of Duke Nukem games, even Golden Eye on 64 etc... so don't let my lack of interest in many first person shooters make you think I am just being nostalgic.This game didn't make me feel like I was returning to Wolfenstein at all. Sure, the original was a bunch of pixels and mazes with nazi's to kill and dogs coming at you, but the feel of this game doesn't feel the same at all. I felt more like I was in some movie starring Jason Stathman as he is sent in to kill nazi's and protect India Jones as he looks for ancient treasure. The first thing I noticed the moment I started playing was the computer AI is horribly programmed. The first nazi I come by ran right up to me, past me, then ran behind me somewhere, like he was looking for a good place to sit down to take aim, and before he could, he was shot dead. Then I noticed things around the place that is there for no reason. I come across some motorbikes, they make noises... do they do anything? No, can you ride them? No. Can you blow them up? No. Why are they there? At least in Duke Nukem games if a useless object is there, say when I found the Delorean from Back To The Future, in Time To Kill (or Land of the babes? one of the two) Duke quote's Biff Tannen and says, \"Hello, McFly, Anyone home?\", it's pointless, but none the less humorous. Where Activision trying to copy that by just adding random things trying to be funny? Or did someone just say, \"euhh, there's too much wall, put a bike in-front of it.\"The second thing I really don't like about this game is the controls. They work OK for what they are, but what they lack is any control over aiming where you want to shoot. A lock onto enemy button would have been nice, or at least auto aim or something, because I don't know how tired I got of coming down stairs and someone is shooting me, and I have to look down in order to shoot them... it sounds like something you could get used to, but it feels like you are armed with a sling shot, while a mouse is running frantically between your legs in circles as you try to look down and maneuver around in circles yourself trying to get a lock on them. That's another thing... you only need to hit an enemy close enough to kill them, don't worry about aiming for bodies or head shots, just fart in their general direction and they will eventually smell it.In the original Wolfenstien there was a tonne of great array you could choose from. In this one, there is barely a decent weapon to be found. Most of them are hand guns, sniper rifles and single shot pistols. There is only a couple of machine guns, most of which are semi-automatics, and from what I can tell, only one decent rapid firing machine gun. However, there is no big cool gun... the original version of this game you had a cool mini-gun, why wouldn't that be included in the sequel? Maybe they wanted to go a bit more realistic, as it is supposed to be set in the 1940's or so, but hey, they had bazookas, hand grenades, molotov cocktails and what not back then too... couldn't those have been integrated with the artillery of this game? God, anything to just blow up a bunch of people at once would have been nice. Maybe that's just Duke's thing, I dunno, but this game needed more, MUCH more.The levels all seem too alike. Do you really need 10 levels per episode or the same damn thing over and over and over again? Your mission, find something, get out. Don't get killed. Next mission, find something, get out, don't get killed. And so on, and so on, and so on, and so on... YAWNNNNNNNNNNNN.What else surprises me about this game is there is no cheats. None without a action replay device or something. Now, before you say something about real gamers don't need cheats, let me remind you, Wolfenstein was pretty much the inventor of God Mode. Remember that name? Whether you would use it or not, why would you make a sequel like this and not include what made the original so damn popular in the first place? Come on, how many of you played the original and never once used God Mode??? Or the All Weapons cheat, or even the All Keys cheat??? Come on, raise your hand. How could they forgot to include these things in this version?I only got through about 20 levels of this game before I packed it in out of boredom or having to do the same thing over and over and over again. I really don't care how the game ends. Obviously Statham and Indy beat the bad guys, the proof lies in history, because the Nazi's where all taken out when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star II.The last thing is the sound, or should I say sounds. The sound of weapons and everything is fine, but the sounds of the Nazi's is what puts me off. They all speak perfect English! One of the coolest things of the original game was the sounds of the Nazi's saying things you had no idea what, unless you spoke German, but come on, why do they all speak English and say, \"There he is, get him\"... not even in a German accent???One last thing, it's not a biggie... but remember the cute pitbulls in the original? I would have liked to see them return and come running after me for a bullet to the forehead... unless they are somewhere later in the game, they don't make a return. Damn FCC and PETA. Cruelty to animals in the real world is wrong, but in video games it should be OK. It's not like anyone who played Mario Bros went out and stomped on a turtle and kicked his shell into a sewer pipe.____Overall____Gameplay  : 3/5Story  : 2/5Grahpics  : 2/5Controls  : 3/5Sound  : 2/5Replay V  : 0/5Extras  : 0/5________________Total  | 1.7\n",
      "This game is terrible.  I rushed out and bought it on release day.  If only I had a time machine....I only played about 15 minutes of this game and turned it off.  I got rid of it as fast as possible.  The graphics are lame and the gameplay is not much better.  The controls were confusing to say the least.  What bothered me the most, however, was the glitches.  I repeatedly witnessed enemies getting \"hung up\" on things in the game, thus allowing me to wail on them while they could not chase me or attack.Overall = TerribleThe PC version of this game is much, much, much better and I highly recommend it, especially compared to this pathetic attempt at gaming.\n",
      "The game was a complete disappointment. Maybe I had my expectations set a bit too high. All the landscapes seem similar and like one of the other reviewers correctly pointed out, the controls make your head spin. Very difficult to figure out where you are on the map and where your partner is (if you play the co-op mode)and the colors downright suck\n",
      "After trying to play this game I now know why noone in the cast wanted to take part in the game eather through a likeness or voice.The game is garbbage,do not waste your time or money on it it is not worth it\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, this game is great.  But the game could have used MUCH more tech support before release.  It wasn't THAT important for it to come out the same day as Reloaded, was it?You can't even beat the XBOX version, as a bug freezes the game right as you go through a vital door.  The PS2 version freezes during loading, and the GCN chase sequence at the end?  I hope you don't run into the walls, as you'll get stuck in them...  I guess the Architect crashed the Matrix, cause this is UBERREALISTIC to some of the stuff Neo and crew go through in the movies...\n",
      "Ok that was wrong to say... Crackheads are too smart to buy this game. Steal it if you want it but I bet you'll be selling it on eBay a couple days later... This game is so stupid, just another way for the brothers to make a few extra bucks. Buy a modchip and download it on KaZaA or something.\n",
      "I played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and I did see cut sequences, but nothing cool. I felt bad that I had paid $ to view an ad for Matrix 3. I felt that the gameplay was not only weak but also boring. It was exceptionally easy.The only good thing about the game was that the CGI in the game matched the terrible CGI in the movie, so I felt like I was actually playing the movie.If you have to play this game to see what was not in the movie. Don't waste your time or money if you're interested in gameplay.\n",
      "...The first thing that I found annoying about this game were the controls.  Most games I play have the A and X buttons for punching and kicking.  This had B and Y. Also, you must press the right joystick in any direction to toggle between first person mode.  Isn't it a waste of a joystick to use it as a toggle button.  To look around in first person mode, you must go back to the left joystick.  Also, you cannot move your character in first person mode.  I needed to move slightly sideways to get someone in the crosshairs, but I had to go out of first person mode, move, then go back into first person mode.I also thought the \"Fire\" button was not very intuitive.  Additionally, when you are playing Ghost in the driving mode, you only have to worry about three controls.  That being the case, they still decided to change what you use as the \"Fire\" button.  Why not keep it consistent with what was used in the non-driving modes?I like games that help you escape into the world of the game.  I don't like to feel like I am playing a monotonous arcade game.  With \"Enter the Matrix\", I felt like I was playing an arcade game.  At one point, you couldn't drive through the wooden gate arms at a toll booth.  Instead, the game told you to survive for 2 minutes, then the gates would open.  Oh yeah, I could see that happening in the movie.  Yeah, right.I did like the \"Focus\" feature which allowed you to go into \"Bullet time.\"...\n",
      "This game is the worst game I have played since Land of the Dead: Road To Fiddlers Green. To start, how can this game get a decent grade for controls!? Its TERRIBLE and BROKEN!!!!!!! To aim down-sight you must press the LEFT STICK!!! WTF!!? And not only that, but you have to effin hold the thing!!!!!!! And since the control sensitivity is a default ULTRA LIGHT SPEED FAST, it is IMPOSSIBLE to aim. Jumping is left trigger... yeah, wtf!? Additionally, to switch weapons you must hold the RIGHT stick in and open an inventory screen in which you freeze your character in place and leave him open to be attacked and most likely killed.... on top of THAT your guns are atrocious in aiming... you will literally, I mean L-I-T-E-R-A-L-L-Y shoot circles around the soviet soldiers. ON THE SUBJECT of Soviet soldiers... these motha flippins take SOOOOO many shots that not even the marvel super hero Hulk could survive... gotta calm down.. back to the controls. Eventually you get to lead your rebellious New York soldiers, so \"Y\" tells them to go to one spot (if you hold down Y then the entire team goes to the spot while just tapping it sends ones soldier), pressing \"B\" tells them to defend one spot, and \"X\" tells them to regroup.. sounds easy right? well its NOT!!! I guarentee you will find yourself pressing X to reload, but wind up calling your men back... what IS the reload button you ask? HAHAHAH! There is none, you actually reload if you don't shoot for a handful of seconds. Very awkward if there is a break in an intense fire fight yanno? Its like... *RATATATATATATATA...reload automatically while enemy is standing there shooting you*Lets talk about the AI and the bugs plauging this lackluster game. Theres a SERIOUS chopping issue within Freedom Fighters, where enemies can shoot through and run walls, appear out of thin air, or just never stop coming. Ontop of that you can stand in front of an enemy for about 5 minutes (yes I did time this) before they go \"Holy **** thats an American soldier!\" and shoot at you with 100% accuracy. Then comes your partner AI.... when it comes to shooting enemies they are okay, but they DO NOT LISTEN TO YOU!!!!! Numerous times have I told a soldier to stand in one spot only to see him run off and get slaughtered. OH YES I FORGOT TO MENTION: a LOT of the time, your soldiers will run towards fences that are suppose to basically be a barrier for the end of the level or a barrier to make you find another way around and actually run right through it.. I swear to Buddha.I think the story and how they pieced together the missions were probably the only good part of this title. Basically, the Russians beat the United States in building the first atom bomb, nuked Japan and forced its way into Europe seizing control of the continent. From there they moved into Cuba and then one day attacked Manhatten, NY. Moving on, each mission affects another one. For instance in one mission labeled \"The Bridge\" you must use TNT to blow up a bridge, but you must clear the stage, then go back to the stage \"The Hotel\", pick up the TNT while heading back to \"The Bridge\" and then use the TNT on the bridge which will help the people from the \"Firehouse\" stage to sweep through. I thought that was kind of cool... but thats it.A combination of horrendous controls, disgusting music, glitches, bugs, atrocious AI, and punishing difficulty make Freedom Fighters one of the worst original X-Box titles I have ever played. How in the name of Zeus did this game get a 9.3? I honestly do not see it.\n",
      "I'm flabbergasted for two reasons:First, how did Activision manage to make a PS2 sequel to a PS1 game that's actually WORSE than the original??  It defies logic! This game has the absolute WORST CAMERA ANGLES OF ALL-TIME!!!  To top it off, the character movement and combat is \"wooden\" at best.  I have better games on my friggin cell phone.Second, how in the LL Cool J did so many Amazon users give this a good review??  Argh!You'd be better off playing PS1 'Tenchu: Stealth Assassin' again than wasting your time on this stinker.  Seriously.ADDED:Playing Wrath of Heaven is like playing the unfinished test-version of Stealth Assasin.\n",
      "When i first played the sims it was on the computer and i couldn't get enough of it! Then the sims 2 came out and it was 10 times better. When i went back to play the 1st one it totally sucked compared to the 2nd one. Then a i came upon the first sims for the gamecube and im like sure what the hell i will give it a shot! BIG MISTAKE!!!!!It was so annoying! It took forever to fill up there needs! They were super slow! The graphics were bad. The story mode was the worst because the tasks were stupidly hard.Don't waste your money on this terrible game! But the sims 2 or the sims 2 pets for the gamecube so much better!\n",

      "i got what i order the way they said would come. no complaints will purchase from them again and recommend to others. keep up good work.product description kinda over hypes game but was worth the money i spent\n",
      "I dont know how the game was because i never got it and nobody did anything about it, market seller's rules DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Save your money, (even if it goes on sale) this is the worst game I have ever played. If you want to play a fun game play Longest Journey or Syberia or Dark Fall, Post Mortem is the most boring game ever and the music was lousy, interaction was awful, and the characters have no personality. The puzzles are almost non-existant. Sorry, but I wasted my money so save yours.\n",
      "Okay I just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this. I couldn't play it. It took like 5 minutes for him to close the door. Why do they move so slowly? I couldn't stand it. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. If the game is slow like this demo I will not buy this.\n",
      "This is the second product I have purchased made my MICROIDS.  The first product has and install problem from the 2nd disk.  I tried on two different systems and both failed.  Contacted customer support and they told me to take it back to the store where I purchased it.  DUH!  Bought it new online a few months back and I didn't get around to playing it.  So, I was SCREWED on that game.  (Product was Still Life).  I researched the problem 'cyclic redundancy error' and many message boards reported it is a flaw with Microid's product.Tried installing this game.  On one computer I was disappointed in the video which ran so SLOW.  Frame by frame animation!  Blah.  Tried it on my other computer and the animation was okay but the audio was terrible.  Lip sink was way off and bad problem with voice over.  Every time one character talked the second one talked at the same time before the first was complete.  Again, I purchased this new and didn't get around to it till now. It's doubtful that I'll play this game either as the voice over is too distracting.Customer service.  Won't waste my time.  I am screwed AGAIN by this poor quality company.NOTE:  My system met and exceeded all the requirements, all drivers are up to date.  It's just poor programing from an inferior company.I WILL \"NEVER\" BUY A PRODUCT MADE BY MICROIDS AGAIN!!!!\n",
      "All I have to say is don't waste your time and money to buy this game. This add on is horrible. The company tried to hard to make this game and they really need to fix this game up. These add ons are just plain boring.If you want to try to make a better innovation pc game for the community, then I suggest you to fix up this game now. Stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Wacky Worlds Expansion Pack!\n",
      "If you've read my review over Marvel vs. Capcom 2 then you know I have given it the title if Possibly The Best, After playing this game I decided I had to review it that way I would have both ends of the fighting games world. Amazon Reviewers love this game so my ranking is going to take a hit but, so be it someone has to state the obvious about this game. As said in the last sentence Amazon reviewers just love this game reason is, they're Inuyasha fans. Don't get me wrong I love Inuyasha and own a collection of the DVD's; I'm just not a blind leader of the hanyou I guess. For some reason the plot gets a lot of praise, I for one have no idea why. Shippou and Kagome fight because... Kagome runs out of snacks, yes folks, the people at Bandai really put their heads together for this plot. Yeah you're collecting shards and yes they have a little explanation before you start fighting, does that really count? That's all from the show, and as soon as the little explanation to you collecting shards is over and you actually start fighting the plot disappears, the story does not unfold at all. This is a fighting game however so bad plot is extremely forgivable. Then there are the controls... which are way too simple. People may list simple controls under the heading of good things about the game but me, not if they're this simple. I've played RPG's with more complex controls. Characters seemed limited with a low number of moves and special moves that are way below spectacular, extremely below. The difficulty of this game is just amazing; buy this game and less than 15 minutes later it's possible to already have beaten the game with at least one character, maybe less than that. Characters look horrible, why wasn't there an Inuyasha game for the PS2 to be brought to our shores? Is this just a game to try and squeeze the PSX for all it's worth? The game does look thrown together. Couldn't they have at least translated? The only good thing I can think of about this game is Dream Fairy Tale and the fact that yes its Inuyasha.\n",
      "This game is like the worst game ever made. I'm a really huge fan of stealth games, and other games that have a similar feel to this one. However, this game did horrible.This is the sort of game where they tell you it all depends on stealth, but in the end, you can tell that: level &quot;A&quot; requires stealth tactics to reach a goal, but level &quot;B&quot; requires outright mayhem. Often if you make a small mistake, you're practically dead. Sure you regenerate some health, but it is painstakingly slow, and in at least one level you have to do without.The stealth is also very clunky. You enter a sort of cutscene when you implement the move, and whereas this looks cool, the lack of control and longevity more often than not cause you to be seen by his buddy.The actual &quot;outright mayhem&quot; part of the game is EXTREMELY poor. Though they try to implement a system of &quot;special moves&quot;, the timing is hard to master and the chances to use them so few and far between that you often forgot the buttons you need to push (i.e. the controls are pretty crappy). Not to mention the lack of a tutorial really hurt the game, as it took me like 20 minutes to get out of the first room (I died twice before i figured out how to kill the first goons, and then it took another 10 minutes to figure out how to open the door).Everything in the game is a bit choppy--but that doesn't mean that it isn't addictive. The game actually somehow still comes across as fun. I think you could actually overlook most of the faults, if you had the ability to save anywhere. Doing the same level over and over isn't my idea of a good game.My recommendation is to rent it--don't buy it, not for any price above a rental price anyway.\n",
      "Bought this product on 11/18/04 from Walmart and for the first week it worked great.  It had over a hundred games preloaded in, and I was able to add new codes to the game.  Unfortunately I assumed too much, and assumed that it would work flawless, so I threw away my receipt and the box and only kept the manual and game.However just today I loaded this unit, and all my codes were ERASED!!  I did not do anything, the machine just erased all my codes!  What a piece of junk!\n",
      "I have to give this a one star rating in hopes that people will read this.  I have a wii system and although this is advertised wii compatible, IT IS NOT WII COMPATIBLE.  You might be okay if you have one of the first wiis that were produced and have never taken it online and have not played any new wii game.  The updates for the system make it so you cannot use any cheat devices.  It wont even work for playing gamecube games.  If you want to cheat on a gamecube game, use a gamecube.\n",
      "I don't even have this product, but I have SD Media Launcher for NGC and I know that the disc is a relabeled AR disc, but it actually comes w/ an adapter and has some homebrew support unlike the new AR (a list of AR codes appear on a background w/ the \"Action Replay\" logo using SD Media Launcher, if an SD card isn't inserted).If you're getting this new product for cheats go ahead (you can cheat on homebrew and/or the AR disc included w/ SD Media Launcher anyway... it makes this product less than pointless...), but keep in mind that only SD media launcher can boot homebrew (like dol files, some used for legal back-ups, and even bootable dol files for earlier versions of AR which aren't avaliable/discontinued!!) unlike this. I have SDLOAD, GCoS 1.5, AR 1.08, etc all in DOL files (homebrew) and it's all thanks to SD Media Launcher, so either get SD Media Launcher and/or AR 1.08 (real disc, however, it's discontinued..) + SD Gecko for booting homebrew on your NGC console!\n",
      "It was broken when I got it the disk wouldnt read. I am going to have to send it in to the company.\n",
      "My high expectations for this game were shattered after I played it.  This game does not boast any positive aspects that I can think of, therefore I will mention the cons.  First off, the car physics are atrocious.  Or better yet I should deduce that there are no car physics.  It seems like the developers spent no time trying to make this feel realistic.  Taking corners doesn't have a solid or natural feel.  The car usually turns too sharply.  The fighting is equally lack luster and repetitive.  When I say repetive, people that are reading this and have played the game are nodding their heads in agreement, because repetitive is the perfect word to describe the fighting.  You'll press a couple buttons, maybe you'll have a gun at times, but it never induces a feeling of fun.  I found myself randomly pressing buttons just waiting for the adversaries to die.  When you want the game to end after a half hour of playing, it means it's time to hand the control to some unsuspecting victim and get away while you can.  Luckily I played this game at my friend's house.  And he was borrowing it from another friend, so neither of us had any money deficits to complain about.  Dropping $50 on a game like this would be unfortunate.  I truthfully cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I would not even recommend it to my worst enemies because playing this game is too harsh of a punishment.  If you want to see how bad it is you are free to rent it, just be aware of how much fun you are not going to have.\n",
      "THIS GAME BLOWS!!! BUY &quot;XIII&quot; IT ROCKS!!!I DION'T EVEN WANT TO GET INTO IT BUT ITS THE SHORTEST GAME I HAVE EVR PLAYED AND ON TOP OF THAT THE GAME PLAY IS DULL?\n",
      "On the X-Box or PS2 I could see where this game could be bearable. The PC version is quite a different story. There is no support for a game pad or joystick, so the only options are keyboard and mouse. The huge map, large assortment of cars and plot mean nothing if you can't control the character or his vehicle.I have never seen controls in a game this lethargic. If you derive some kind of joy from knocking over trees, street lights, sign posts, newspaper stands and parking meters, this is the game for you. Not to worry, on a straightaway the sensitivity returns ensuring your course is as predictable as the lottery. The camera angles seem specifically design to ignore the subject of importance. Sometimes while apprehending a suspect for no apparent reason, the camera will relocate on the other side of a building. During the timed martial arts progression tests, half the time is spent scrolling the lazy (at full sensitivity) camera to look at the target and align the character. It's not a contest of skill, but a struggle with technical ineptness.As for any bugs I have had multiple crashes, from menus locking up to sound loops. My system is fully of capable of playing Doom3, Far Cry and Star Wars Galaxies, so I can assure you it falls well within the basic hardware requirements as well as the latest drivers and direct-x. It's a shame, the game looks good, has a bit of freedom to do side missions etc. If it was playable, I'd be playing it. To sum it all up, it's a good game idea, wrapped in technically flawed garbage.\n",
      "this game sounded awesome 2 hours after playing it and beating it I thanked God that it was my Stepdad's Christmas present and not mine. The figting system is the worst ever, the driving is like driving in a crappy arcade game, and the shooting is way to easy. Like I said if you can't beat this game in 2 hours you are an idiot. I haven't played many games worse then this one save your money and like everyone else is saying buy a different game. Go with the Getaway if you want a better game like this that isn't GTA at least the Getaways story and gameplay where good\n",
      "This has got to be the worst game ever made!!!!  The missions are easy as hell!!! There are stupid multiple endings wich are not that important to me.  Kungfu|!!!!! WOW!  At least gta had an actual criminal who can do s**t.  Big deal,rap music!GTA3 had true gangster music wich was scarface!  True crimes blew big time.  I rented it and beat it in 2 days wich wasnt that much time for me to do.  Over all it sucks.IF you want a true gaming masterpiece get Grand Theft Auto3or vice cityTHIS GAME SUCKS, there are no helicopters no motorcyles ectjust plain stealling cars.  Hey miday Why dont you come up with something Original!I GIVE IT -1000000000\n",

      "got this because we (two family members, two friends and myself) wanted a 6 player risk game without setting up all those freakin' pieces on a board. the PS1 version only lets 4 human players and 2 computer players in on a game but we LOVE IT even though when were all together, someone has to sit out. THIS VERSION OF THE GAME IS AWFUL THOUGH! i spent a half hour trying to save all players names and colors only to finally say to myself &#34;ok the games a bit faulty as far as saving goes. thats a shame&#34;. it wouldnt just simply save any more than three names in a six player game. it would just replace one with a new name once a fourth was entered and 'saved'. it even tends to say a player is 'already in this game' when it is clearly not and wont let you put really anything in the player slot after this screw up. but it doesnt end there... its confusing, slow and downright LAME. the only thing that saves it (in some way) is pressing Select for help to figure out what button to press to do what. also, in the ps1 version, it will ask you if you are sure when you press a button/make a decision. this doesnt! you set your battalions and press the O button, SORRY your turn is over.. understood that when it becomes second nature you wont make those mistakes but what if a finger slips or a button is accidentally pressed when passing the controller? another thing that just sucks is the fact that you NEED a second controller when any more than one player is in the game. WHY though? the first controller does EVERYTHING besides one thing.. DEFEND... ok, so that means one controller is being passed to set battalions, attack, check cards, free move, ect.. but you have to pass ANOTHER controller to the person youre attacking just so they can press X to pretty much say &#34;ok you can attack me&#34;. REALLY?? its not like the defender can say &#34;no i dont feel like being attacked&#34;. the only thing exclusive to the second controller you can do is choose the number of dice to defend with and NOTHING ELSE.. awful... maybe the second controller plays a different role in the other modes but by this time ive already decided not to play this unless the group wants to give it a whirl.. five minutes in, theyll change their minds. i guarantee it.. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n",

      "It's a fun game. Wee, woohoo, yippee! You learn to fly the planes with the greatest of ease, and zip through the storyline. The graphics are great! Sometimes you have to replay a part 2 or 3 times to get past it. It's challenging! But then, you get to a part in the story called Soloho's Challenges (go on, google it). That is where the game ends for most people. Because suddenly, your are required to have a skill level that is totally out of line with the rest of the game - sorta like \"catch this peanut, catch this peanut, STOP THESE BULLETS WITH YOUR TEETH!\". After 40, 50, 60 tries, you take the disk out of the xbox, and throw it away. It'll make you angry. You will never finish it. Or if you do finish it, you'll never get that  40 hours of your life back...  It's explain why such a highly rated game ended up in the $5 and under bin.I loved it right up to the moment I hated it. And then I hated it enough to pitch out. I'm not sadistic enough to trade this piece of junk in... If you must play it, try to borrow it. Most people who own it will say \"keep it\".\n",
      "I've played RPG Maker 1 for the PS1, and I thought it was pretty good, especially for a first entry in a franchise.  But when I bought RPG Maker 2, I was extremely disappointed.  Yes, the game is now in 3D, there are now actual in-battle animations, and the music and sound effects have drastically improved, but none of this matters.  Why?  Because the interface is so clunky and user-UNfriendly that it's impossible for a layman like me to even start creating something.  Tasks that you could accomplish in one screen in RPG Maker 1 now requires two, three, even four separate steps to accomplish, requiring that you save your work, leave to the main menu, then open another screen each time.  The instruction manual is useless because it's practically in another language, and even buying the strategy guide didn't help.  This is definitely NOT a pick up-and-play game.\n",
      "I had in mind that this game was overly complex before I had bought it but I wanted to see for myself since I am little more patient (I thought) than the average person. I found out very quickly that I had made a mistake purchasing this game since it requires that you give up any sembalance of an actual life in order to devote time to it! I finally got frustrated and simply tossed it in my closet of no return where it will remain with a couple of failed novels and various other attempts at creativity. IN SIMPLE WORDS. THIS GAME BITES!!!!\n",
      "I don't even know why I got this game in the first place.  I mean, come on, Funamation knew this was a horrible attempt at a fighter video game.  There's a good selection of characters, but the game is easy to win (simply stand far away and blast away with special energy attacks).  Also, music and sounds are horrible.  There was literally no voice translations, only title translations.  For DBZ fans out there, go buy a PS2 and get Budokai 3.  You'll be spending about $180 more than if you've bought UB22, but you'll surely be happy.\n",
      "It not fair for me because I don't have an Xbox and when my pc version plays it restarts my computer. Come on Atari make Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 for 5 systems. PC, XBOX, Gamecube, PS2, and I'll even settle for GBA if I'm that desperate. I only want this because my computer doesn't like me and never lets me play my games.\n",
      "Stay away from this game. I loved RCT when it came out for the PC, and was looking forward for the Xbox version. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PORT! The graphics are a joke, three generations behind -- approaching Atari 2600. Playing the game with a thumbstick is also very difficult.This is a shame . . . an awful shame . . .\n",
      "So dissappointed!!!I cannot believe that this version of THIS game would actually be worse than the Xbox Version! The graphics are absolutely horrible, worse than Dead Or Alive, worse than the other Soul Caliburs, worse than the Tekkens, worse than the Virtua Fighters, and worse than the Bloody Roar!Gameplay is terrible. The characters have to move so slow in this version.Namco did make a good choice for the special guest star, Link, and that is why this game is worth the one star. It dies not deserve anymore stars.\n",
      "I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but at first i thought this game was fun.with multiplayer simply mashing buttons faster, rather that any form of actual technique, will always guarantee a win.The other issue is simply that there is no AI. At the beginning of the single player arcade style games, the computer opponents just sit there until you knock them out which is about as exciting as staring at the wall. After beating a few dozen rounds the computer opponent improves a little, but then immediately after a few improved rounds, the computer opponents suddenly can move faster than you or anyone else can ever mash a button.You can actually watch legs, weapons, and entire bodies of your player model passing through the computer opponents as you strike(no damage is caused of course, the same is not true of the computer opponent passing through the players character), the computer opponent can block at all times even while striking (the player can only strike or block, not both and there is a transition time between them), and the computer opponent can charge up all weapons in roughly one half the time the player can, and surprise! the computer opponent does between 10x-20x the damage the player can even with the computer doing the lamest misfiring hits. It appears they favored static scripts with very simply conditions to make the computer opponent succeed or fail, including outright cheating. Sad. So unless you're playing other people you're wasting your time and money.Oh and i forgot to mention, the single player 'weaponmaster' mode (called so because it's certainly not story mode) is so boring and contrived that i honestly can not believe it's there. Par for the course...Fortunately I don't have to worry about accidentally buying another product from the company that made soul caliber, they don't make anything else...\n",
      "Soul Calibur II is an excellent game, but the Xbox Version, I daresay, is terrible. The special guest, Spawn, is a horrible fighter. Namco could have done better to pick a better guest star for the Xbox.The graphics is way better then that off the Virtua Fighters, the Tekkens, and the Bloody Roar Series, but that is the only good part, and thats why it is worth one star.\n",
      "This game is fine....Except for it sucks!! It takes no skill whatsoever. A no skill no talent moron could play this game and pretend their good at it. Whoever plays this game and enjoys it is an absolute idiot. This game is nothing compared to hardcore fighters like tekken, street fighter and even king of fighters. When it comes to any aspect of this game it sucks. I must admit the idea of weapons is alright but to make that the key aspect of the game you would think it would be a bit more complicated then just pressing buttons randomly. I swear anyone could win in that game by pressing random buttons. Again a no talent no skill game. Just another example of how much Soul Calibur sucks!!\n",
      "Unless you want some fun for only a week, avoid this disappointing sequel to the truly great game: Halo.Microsoft has done it again: create a great product and follow it up with no substance. There are 1,000 reasons that this game now stinks and you can find them all over the Internet.If you are good with Halo, Halo 2 will be sure to disappoint you. If you have never played before, either one will do, but better players are migrating back to the original.\n",
      "the first time I played it when it was called Turok.  I will never understand the obsession with First Person shooters.  They are all the same and Halo is no different.  Ohhh, you get to drive in a vehicle, been there done that in the 80's and 90's.  Just like Eminem, it's tired folks, move on.\n",
      "HALO 2. Yep. The game EVERYONE said would be the best. The game EVERYONE said would revolutionize gaming. It revolutionized it all right. It made FPS's everywhere feel ashamed that ONE game could be so dull. It is NO, and I mean NO different from the first HALO (which also sucked). It has no point WHAT-SO-EVER. Point A to B (like someone on here had said). Oh yeah, FPS's are supposed to be shooting fun, i know, but they need a point to them, BUT NOT THIS GAME!!!! Shoot, reload, shoot some more. Vehicles give it no touch at all. You want a first person shooter, get STARSIEGE TRIBES for PC. If your PC was mad in 1999 or later, your PC can take a game 10 times better the HALO.\n",
      "Halo 2 is even worse than Halo 1. Halo 2 is more unrealistic than the first. The vehicles are mainly the same and the guns are a little different. If you didnt like the firt Halo dont buy this because it is even stupider. They should have changed the name because it sounds like a game for girls. The grafics havent gotten better. If you like realistic shooting games get Conflict Veitnam. It is very realistic and theres 14 missions and over 40 weapons.\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of the first Halo which I bought over a year ago for my computer and I STILL play online on a weekly basis. Sure, the story and structure of the campaign itself are lifted from the original Half Life, but as Picasso once said, \"Good artists borrow, great artists steal.\" And while Halo's Campaign was great, the Multiplayer was even better.So when Halo 2 came out, I willingly fell into Microsoft's monopoly trap and bought an Xbox figuring the year it would take for it to come out on my computer would be unbearable. Boy what a disappointment. Here's why...REASON #1: THE CURSE OF THE VAPID SEQUELHalo 2 campaign offers nothing new in terms of plot. Just a rehash of the same battles with the Covenant Aliens and some Flood zombies who seem a bit superfluous to the convoluted story-line. Sure you can now hold two weapons instead of just one, and you spend half the game as a covenant alien. But these are really superficial gimmicks. There was nothing substantially different or new to this game.REASON # 2: MICRO$HAFTFirst off, I had no idea Microsoft would actually have the nerve to charge me 10 dollars a month in order to play online. There isn't one PC game that charges me to play online. Why? Because I already pay my cable company for that! So why would Microsoft charge me for a service they don't even provide? Have you read the papers? That's what Microsoft is best at. Charging you for whatever they want because if you don't like it, and want to go somewhere else, you can't. Because they have so much capitol from previous monopolies, they can buy out an entire company for just one single game and only release that game for their own consoles. Which leads to my third disappointment with Halo 2...Reason #3: MICROSOFT MEDIOCRITYBungie designed the interface of the first Halo and it's simple and intuitive. Wanna play online? Hit MULTIPLAYER and then hit SEARCH. Boom! A list of games going on all over the world appear on your screen, listed by server name, game map, game type (capture the flag, slayer, etc), number of players allowed, number of player slots available and server ping speed.In Halo 2, designed by the counter-intuitive geniuses at Microsoft this time rather than Bungie, you can't choose your map, you can't choose your server, or even your specific game type. They choose for you. Sound familiar?And the final reason I am disappointed by Halo 2, it's trite, but I'm passionate about it. Whether I have a head set or not, I am forced to listen to all the stupid, racist, sexist, childish, moronic comments the rest of the world decides to blurt from their ADD-inflicted mouths through my speaker system.At least in Halo 1, all the neo-nazi crap came in the form of text messaging which was easy to ignore as it was fast flying in the corner of your screen. But you can't block out voices without losing all your sound.Sorry guys, some of you might love this new version of Halo, but I'm going back to play Half Life 2 again, a sequel equal to the original. Let's just hope Microsoft doesn't buy out Sierra anytime soon.\n",

      "Maybe I just don't enjoy FPS's like I used to. Maybe I expected too much. Perhaps games of yesterday that I grew up on (Diablo 2, MGS, and Rainbow Six even) spoiled me. Or perhaps I'm the only brave soul to offer a counterpoint to the masses' blinded eyes.I really dislike Halo 2.Come on, admit it. If there was no media hype, no one to talk with it about, and you played it by yourself with an open mind, you would wonder after an hour what you're doing too. If you played good games like the old ones I mentioned or Burnout 3, MK Deception, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein even (reinventing an old school classic, feller) maybe you'd see the light. Halo is nothing more than another Quake 2, another Half-Life 1. Games that supposedly reinvented Doom 1's formula, and made games mass market items. HA. I laugh at all you for wasting your money on these games, and ask you to pity me wasting fifty bucks on what was supposed to be \"the best game ever\". Never will I succumb to blinded critics again. Never! You all probably watched Titanic ten times too, and drool over Desperate Housewives and Extreme Makeover Home Edition. Not me, buddy. I judge things how I see em, not how the mass voice of media does.So for all you like me, straight seers, I recommend rethinking what games you buy. I realize this review will be assaulted by Halo lovers, but I only wish to offer a different view. My view.Peace out.\n",
      "I am no pancake guru, but I can make some really good pancakes from a mix. However, with Batter Blaster's vague and inacurate instructions, you too can attempt 4 times to make a pancake and hilariously burn them every time. The instructions tell you just turn the can upside-down, shake and aim the nossel downward and make a pancake any size you want. The instructions tell you to set your heat to mid-high at 325 degrees. That seems to instantly burn pancakes within a minute of cooking one side. There is no instruction to use any kind of cooking oil or PAM on the pan. With or without, seems to give the same burnt result. So the next time I adjusted to a mid-low temperature like the normal pancakes I've made and that seems to help, but I still manage to burn the pancakes quickly when cooking pancakes from a mix I've never burnt one. Once I finally made an edible pancake there were plenty of air pockets inside of it. It was pretty synthetic tasting. Beware of your results. The instructions also don't say to flip the pancake... so maybe you're not supposed to?After making a few pancakes, I'm just left with a lot of questions and no answers. Perhaps I am too dumb to make something this simple?\n",
      "Great game and I really enjoyed it when it first released, BUT the graphics on the PC have aged terribly and I even have a brand new graphics card and drivers and it still looked pathetic, Vice City just doesn't do it for me anymore when there are better games out now that have move features and better graphics.\n",
      "GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY is one of the greatest games of all time! But don't make the mistake I did. I've already owned the game on the PS2, so I made a dumb decision by buying it on the PC, where I thought the game would have better graphics and controls. I WAS DEAD WRONG! Don't buy this game on the PC unless you have a good computer! I have a Windows XP, so I won't recommend you playing games on this computer! The graphics are even worse then in the PS2 version, and the controls are terrible. What a waste of [money]! Don't be a moron like me, and don't buy this game if you have a [bad] computer!\n",
      "Midnight Club 2 has decent graphics if you have the hardware, but it's a complete failure as a racing game.  All of your computer opponents fly past you even on straight stretches with the throttle maxed.  The damage to your car and others is completely unrealistic, and there's no difference in the way any of these cars drive and handle.  I was disappointed with the driving physics in EA's NFS Hot Pursuit, but this game makes it look like a racing simulation in comparison.  It's not even good enough to be considered an arcade racer as the keyboard controls are overly sensitive and there's no way to adjust the settings.The PS2 version got a lot of positive reviews, but something was lost in the translation to the PC.  If you're looking for a racing game with good graphics and driving physics, NFS Porsche Unleashed is the one to beat.  This game doesn't come close.\n",
      "Prio to buying I contacted Rockstar through their website and customer service, both told me this game would work for Vista... it wont. The disk wont even become recognized by Vista. I am a computer programmer and very use to getting games to work with Vista, but this one just wont do it.Unless you have XP or a little earlier, dont bother buying the game. It will just become a paper weight.Other than that, I have read other reviews that at this day in age, this game isnt worth your time or money anyways.\n",

      "This game was produced by a Japanese company, which may tell you something about the style of graphics (i.e., anime style). The graphics themselves are mediocre.This is a console game, which was ported to the PC...and it really shows. The controls are awkward; they can be reconfigured, but they are still awkward.The first 5 minutes of the game was credits.The next 5 minutes was talk and video.The game is difficult to see; the colors are a dull/dark green.The \"start\" button is the tab button, in case you get frustrated trying to figure-out what button is \"start\".After spending 20 minutes with the game and experiencing the controls and interface, I knew it wouldn't be fun to play.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections\n",
      "I had heard nothing but great things about the High Heat series and though I read that the interface was poor, I thought it wouldn't matter since I had never played before.  Well, I was wrong.  I played probably 4 games and gave up.  This game is absolutely terrible and if 3DO doesn't fix things for next year, they're going to be in a mess of trouble.  This is just sad.\n",
      "This game is the most disappointing game that I've ever played! I have bought this game since 2000, always refering it to the best baseball simulation game out there. But, now I will refer to it as the worst baseball game ever! They have completely changed the game from how it was! For starters you can NOT and I will repeat NOT able to use a mouse to navagate throughout the game instead you use the arrow keys along with the ins,del,home,pg up/dn,end, and esc keys. After playing for 30 sec the only key you will want to hit is the delete key to deinstall it from your computer! I graphics are horrid for it being a 2004 game! Drafting takes hours! Navigation and gme play makes you want to scream and in the end you just want to use the disc as a fisbee in the time that your not playing the 2003 version! Please dont buy this game, I wouldnt ask my worst enemy to even touch the game! Keep your 2003 version, or buy it instead. This is the worst game ever! Watching my dog drool is more entertaining. If I could I would give it a negative rating. I'm sure other feel the same way I do about this sad sad game. If I had my way I would recall every 2004 version of this game and then have a frisbee contest with them. Do NOT buy this game!!! If your looking to buy a baseball game buy the 2003 version of this game, you will NOT regret buying that version, trust me. Just one more time all say it and then I'll be done...DO NOT BUY HIGH HEAT 2004, I highlight 2004, \"4\", \"4\". Thank you for allowing me to vent my frustration from this game. Have a nice day!!!\n",
      "Poor Design. The World map play is dumb. If you attack (and win) the capitol you get all territories of that country (no matter how big). The battles are the similar to the `Age of Empires' with a few new twists.I was not impressed.\n",
      "Okay, so I'm supposed to build buildings and units.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to walk around and discover rarities that merchants can harvest.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to accumulate wood, food, &amp; gold.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to study in the library AND (and this is the part that bugs me most) in every other building.  AND. I'm also supposed to build an army/navy and deploy them in a micromanaging way.  This game has some great parts - I am not denying that.  However, it is a horribly flawed nightmare.  I loved to micromanage in turn-based strategies.  It is next to impossible to accomplish this in a RTS.  I feel torn between wanting to research, build, gather, and explore.  I defy anyone finding an enjoyable balance.  Rise of Nations would be far supperior if it were turn-based.  As it is, I constantly feel as though I'm neglecting one of my four desires.  Also, it is ridiculous to be required to research advancements in multiple buildings.  It sounds organized at first but it becomes a nightmare when trying to stay on top of technology advances.  Developers should make ONE research interface!  Second, units should not build buildings!  Cities should build buildings!  Do not make me responsible for creating a citizen.  This makes no sense.  Buildings a military unit makes tons of sense, but not normal citizens!!!  I am begging the developers to redesign the city interface to encompass these changes!  These minor changes would make this game fanastic.\n",
      "Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run properly on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them \"limited\" accounts (a recommended \"best practice\" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to \"user-level\" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game.Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Rise of Nations is an excellent game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation.More information on this issue is available. ...\n",
      "Rise of the nations does not suck nor it is a superhit.Starting's ok but then,BORING.It's just one of those stragety games which have gone bum after a few days.The controller is pretty sluggish.The countries are almost the same.There is not even one part in the game where 'oh!It's so exiting' comes to your mind.Warcraft is much better.Beleive me\n",
      "The Nintendo DS says that all GBA games play with the DS. This game will not it only plays on the top screen which of course leaves you no way to play the game.

      "Don't believe the crap that they try to sell you here.The reason that its getting so many stars is because they're trying to sell it back and get rid of it, and I'll tell you why.First off, the graphics are nothing special. The camera angle is just flat out piss pore. You have to fight the camera every step of the way, throughout the game. (You'll know what I mean if you go and play it.)The options menu doesn't help ether, when you go to change the controls on your controller it just makes it harder if anything.The level settings are also a complete failure, you'll die at least 30 times just to get to the second level, while the setting is on easy. You can take my word on that.Throughout the game your in a constant state of fighting an uphill battle, your constantly out numbered, your usually almost dead at the end of every battle.You will say to yourself at times; \"How can anyone play this game on a hard level and actually win?\"The level that I made it to was a boss on a horse that constantly had men showing up, is just impossible to beet. After that I just quit the game.In a nutshell:The the fighting engine is awful.The camera angles are a never ending struggle.Option menu is useless.And the pressure just continues as you go on. The harder it gets, the less you want to play it.Unless if you get joy out of yelling at your TV all the time. Do NOT buy or even rent this game. This game is increasingly stressful and you will find NO rest or fun in this game at all.\n",
      "I was not pleased with this game. Although I am a major fan of the both the original and remade Battlestar Galactica this game was very difficult to control and track the cylons right from mission 1.  Unless you are already an ace at working the controllers and have every button's location memorized like your hand, you'll spend most of your time trying to even find a cylon (even though they are all over you and the Galactica).  Part two of mission 1 is almost impossible to beat and you have to start the game over from the very start every time.  Stick with just the TV shows.\n",

      "Ok..I have to admit, for awhile I was addicted to the sims-- I mean totally addicted. I had all sorts of crazy dyfunctional families living in the most bizarre houses and wearing the most bizarre clothes I could possibly find. All of my sims were at the top of their career ladders with tons of friends and lots of money. But then I realized... something was definitely missing. The games just werent fun anymore. I even bought Unleashed, Vacation, and Living Large to add something..that missing ingredient. But I still haven't found it. And The Sims now sits on the shelf all alone..and I dont think I ever want to play it again. The little objects are &quot;amusing&quot; for awhile, but then everything becomes too repitive. A game is supposed to take you far and away into a whole different world, but the Sims is almost exactly like normal day life with a few strange objects, perfect weather, and never-aging people. No matter how many new junk Maxis piles into the expansion packs, the game will never have a point. And please, if you already got a lot of Sims products, you really need to stop buying these games. They become a large expense, take up a ton of computer memory, and get pretty boring in a short period of time.\n",
      "This is a polygonal beat-em-up game along the lines of Fighting Force and Hidden Invasion. And like those two, it's a horrible game.The camera is sloppy. Not as bad as Hidden Invasion, but it can sometimes get stuck at inappropriate places (I ain't talkin' in a good way either!), and you have no control over it.The gameplay is monotonous. You knock thugs around and then follow an arrow to where you beat more people up. At some point in the stage, you press the A button to activate a switch or call another Angel.The controls are awkward. Once again, the analog shoulder buttons are used at full disadvantage: you have to press them all the way in until they click. On the default control set-up, you jump with B, punch with Y, kick with X, pick stuff up with A, focus on an enemy with R, switch targets with Z, and temporarily power-up with L. This setting can be frustrating when trying to perform an arial attack. You can also switch the actions of B and X, but that doesn't really make things easier. If you have to know, the Start button pauses the game and brings up a menu, the control stick moves the Angel, and the cross-pad and yellow C-stick do nothing as far as I remember.The music is so-so, with various techno-tunes and a louzy digital song at the Start Menu.You can access bonus features, such as a Teaser, photos, and...uh, I can't remember what else, by collecting CDs and memory sticks scattered around the areas. You can also watch each computer-generated Full-Motion Video piece as many times as you want after you get to that part in the game.The character models might pass for okay on an earlier console, but on today's systems, I expect more polygons and better textures. The outfits aren't too bad though.I don't recommend buying this game or even playing it. If you have to satisfy your curiosity like I did, try a rental.\n",
      "This game is average to slightly hard level. Spyro's moves are ice breath, super ice breath, fire breath, fire ball, wind, super wind-electric breath, glide, and charge. His objective is to collect items and gems and trade them for hearts needed to complete the game. The game is relatively boring, especially whenever your constantly going back and forth between two worlds to open chest or return items you you've found. There is almost no storyline, as with most Spyro games.\n",
      "Yeah, you heard me right. Before you go ballistic on me, though, let me say WHY this game has infuriated me.Essentially, this game is the exact same as Infection. You still run around computer generated dungeons, trying to forward the story (which does get a bit more interesting, but not NEARLY enough to save this game). You still data drain and gate hack and fight big bosses with your ever-growing party (all of the new characters, incidentally, have the most annoying voices and inane dialogue imaginable) until you duke it out with a super boss at the end, and save your data to load into the next game.Of course, this isn't enough to warrant 1 star; indeed I played the first game and liked it, despite being too easy and a bit short (only 20-25 hours to beat the last boss). No, where this game fails is the following: You are actually PENALIZED for purchasing and playing the first game! By playing Infection, you essentially remove half of the levels in Mutation! That's right; BANDAI, in its infinite wisdom, decided that they would put amny of the levels from Infection into Mutation, I guess so that they could bring in some new saps. Of course, that means that they've given the shaft to fans of the game, figuring that we're so stupidly addicted to their product that we will purchase the sequels, no matter WHAT they do. So, there are no benefits to playing the first game, except that you can keep you old emails and character name (whoopee). I finished Mutation in 9 hours. NINE!!!!I've already been burned, but I hope I can give YOU an option. If you want to play 9 hours for fifty bucks, buy the game. Otherwise, I suggest you wait for Xenosaga, episode 2; those folks know how to TREAT fans!\n",
      "Okay I was a beta tester for this game and over the course of the beta i liked it a bit at FIRST. What an Unfortunate occurence that they took what could have been a great game in it's early stages and every single new patch that came out just kept ruining the game more and more. A new patch would come out and i'd have hopes they'd undo some of the lame changes they made and wouldn't you know it, they only made the changes worse.I would say the only positive elements to this game were being able to \"cue\" your upgrades(hence the 1 star) and making the Undead a much better race. All in all your still limted to FOUR races while a RTS called Rise of Nations has 18 RACES ! YES my friends 18 races to choose from all with their own UNIQUE UNITS. Best of all your never limited to a specific build order and you have things like Attrition damage and National Boundaries. Things like Forts and Towers actually do damage and don't fall instantly to fire.After playing some other games like Rise of Nations i realized that Blizzard is making this more for thier youngest CORE gamers and players and well them youngins can have it. I'd say it aimed more for the 12-18 range than anything else. So you Blizzard Fanboys can have your Frozen Throne i'll just keep playing Rise of Nations and have a blast.Older more mature gamers who want a little more thought and a little less repetition should get Rise of Nations.It's Blizzard. so of course I did buy it just for the new World Editor, so i can UNDO Blizzard's changes and actually have a LITTLE fun with it. Guess i'll be stuck playing custom games.That is not a sign of a great game. A sign of a great game is being able to play any style, multiplayer, against the AI, random people on battle.net or your friends. It's just not worth it to only be able to play custom games...I'd like to mention this game got a 4 out of 5 rating while Rise of Nations got a 5 out of 5. Guess who got Real Time Strategy right ? NOT Blizzard ! I hope some from blizzard reads this review and maybe just maybe they'll take a look at Rise of Nations and figure out what to do right next time.  They turned Warcraft into Rushcraft which is the element of change i didn't like.\n",
      "[Boot-Crash,Boot-Crash...] Its the Painkiller Polka!That's what happened after I installed this mess. I knew that I was in trouble when the package contained 3 CDs and there was a message on the box stating: \"Whoops, we messed up, use CD #3 to start the game, not #1...Duh.\" Uh-Oh!!And of course, after installing this game, then downloading the patch (ALREADY, the developers have a patch? Why does'nt Dreamcatcher just finish testing the game before they start selling it??) the darned thing still does'nt work.Worse yet, its an exception that is not handled since there is no error message: Just \"Boot\" then \"Crash\"!I know what you are thinking: \"Well, you must have a bad system, it works fine on my machine.\" First, I have over 300 games loaded on my PC - from Microsoft Pinball to Dead Man's Hand - and they all work. I have the latest version of DirectX loaded and my video card is an 128 MB ATI 9000 series, my sound card is an Audigy 2 and my computer has a Gig of RAM and it is a P4 2.5 Ghz.But that really is'nt the point. I expect a complete game when I plunk down some serious $$ for one; not some patched-up mess. I should'nt have to rebuild my entire PC to run this game when over 300 others (including games released in the same month as \"Painkiller\") work perfectly.This is just a sloppily slapped-together piece of code. Don't waste your time on it until they fix ALL the bugs.\n",
      "You gotta be kidding me... This is why I threw my DOOM game away! All this game is about mindless shooting! No plot to the game at all, just run around and kill things! Hey! I LOVE FPS but this is ridiculous! This is the first game I've bought in a LONG time that isn't worth the money. Oh sure, the graphics are ok, even a bit spooky, but geez, gimme a break! It must've been designed for mindless gamers without any other purpose other than to shoot things... What a waste! You go from one level to the next, mindlessly shooting creatures. Over and over and over again... Don't waste your money! Buy Far Cry. It's by far the best game out so far...\n",
      "ok. Most of us expect some cliches when playing a FPS. It's part of the genre, fair enough, but there is no excuse for unispired level design, creatures, lame enemy A.I. and boring game play. Do the graphics look nice? Sure. Is the sound decent? It's ok. It won't scare the wits out of you like System Shock 2 or Doom, but it'll do. Is it fun? Absloutely not. Most of the attacks can be avoided by side stepping (strafing). The enemy is far from engaging and the levels have a rehashed \"boring been there done that\" feel to them ...\n",
      "I thought it'd be fun to play an ultra-violent game for a change.  It was fun, for the first 5 minutes.  After that, the game gets a little old and makes you a little cranky.  Especially when you sit and wait for the next scenario to load.  I think the developers did that on purpose to tick-off the gamer even more, and make him even more violent.The graphics started out nice enough, but I guess the guy doing the building interiors had the week off when they put this game together.As far as a fulfilling experience, the only thing this game teaches is how to get mad.  Most of us have figured that out, already.For all you Gary Coleman fans, this game is a must!!!For everyone else, you can find better use of your time.\n",
      "Obviously intended to be irreverent, super-violent, and disturbing, rating Postal 2 on a politically correct, moral, or ethical basis would be ridiculous. So let's just rate it on quality of programming and enjoyment of gameplay, shall we?The graphics: Not bad, but certainly not on par with games like No One Lives Forever 2 and Mafia. The game does utilize the Unreal engine and has some nice textures here and there, but the town has a very artificial and claustrophobic feel to it. The NPC textures are o.k., as well, but nowhere near those in Return to Castle Wolfenstein.The sounds: Very so-so. I found the weapon sounds in particular to be very unrealistic - especially the AR15. (It sounds like an airgun.) In a game where gunplay is an essential part of the fun, this is a glaring flaw.A.I. - Not nearly good enough to be satisfying in the way the game claims to aspire to. To truly descend into the cellar of bad taste, the NPC's would have to behave in a believable manner, with a certain complexity of interaction available. As it stands, the NPC's have a very limited range of behaviors. This, combined with the so-so graphics makes for a very artificial environment.Gameplay: Obviously, the creators did not have the funding nor programming talent to make Postal 2 into a game with cutting-edge graphics and groundbreaking gameplay. Even with these limitations, however, the developers could have made the game far more fun with just a little thought into what makes all of us want to go \"postal\". Getting stuck in traffic, having to wait in long lines, getting diss'd by a rude employee - with a little creativity, the programmers could have inserted these scenarios into the game to add fuel to our virtual postal tendencies. As it stands, apart from the postal dude's general psychosis, your player has no real motivation to go wacky - and the A.I. just isn't good enough to make it fun when you do. Without these assets, any open-ended environment - no matter how big - won't keep you coming back for more...System Specs: P4 1.9ghz, 512mb rambus, Geforce4 Ti4600 128mb, Soundblaster Xgamer. Game ran fine on highest resolution with only a few stutters here and there, but I found loading times to be a bit excessive - especially considering the lesser graphic quality.\n",
      "Developer Running With Scissors was obviously trying to cash in on the popularity of Rockstar's &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, and they failed miserably.  The game is boring and pointless.The plot is simple: the player assumes the role of &quot;The Postal Dude&quot; and, each day, sets off to complete a list of boring tasks, like going to the store for milk.  Invariably each mundane task ends in disaster as various nutty groups in the game burst in and start shooting.The game plays up the &quot;choice&quot; the player has, whether to be passive or to &quot;go postal&quot; with various weapons.  There's no reason to play passive, and the novelty of the over-the-top violence gets old fast.  Characters spout inane dialog, and the only high point of the game is when Gary Coleman (yes, Gary Coleman) makes an appearance at a mall which, of course, ends in a gun battle.Although powered by the Unreal engine, Postal 2 looks drab.  Out of the box, the game has some serious bugs, including ridiculously long load times between levels.  This gets frustrating fast as there are so many level changes to get from point A to point B.  A recent patch has fixed this issue, but the game remains a pointless exercise in futility.Sometimes the saving grace for a bad single-player game can be the multiplayer option.  &quot;Postal 2&quot; does not have multiplayer.  Instead, you have to actually purchase the multiplayer add-on for $9.95.  Running With Scissors might have scored an extra star had it released the multiplayer part for free, as was the case with the &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; multiplayer expansion, &quot;Enemy Territory,&quot; which started life as an expansion to RTCW and ended up being a free stand-alone product.You're better off spending the $20 on the vastly superior &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; or, for ten bucks more, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.&quot;  Either choice is a better one than the terminally boring &quot;Postal 2.&quot;\n",
      "This game is a lame excuse for attention.  The missions are meaningless and stupid.  You go to the store to buy a gallon of milk, there's one mission.  The game says \"only as violent as you are\" but is intentionaly made for you to be as violent as possible, or the missions wouldn't be so linear and stupid. Cutting a young girl's head off with a shovel, blowing a police officers head off with a shotgun and kicking it around as a soccer ball, pouring gasoline on someone and lighting them on fire, and harming/brutaly murdering helpless animals are some examples of the terrible and discusting violence included.  Obviously the people that make this need to be sent to an insane asylum because it is not funny at all.  It's the grossest game on the market and totaly uncalled for.  If you're gonna make a game as graphicly violent as you can, the least you could do is include some bad guys.  But there are none at all, except for yourself.  The graphics aren't good, and everything else about the game \"is bad\" to an unbelievably high extent.  I'm not one to complain about a violent video game but this is just sick.  Go buy GTA3 or Vice City if you want to go on a rampage because this game is sofa king dumb.  Avoid at any and all costs.  If you find it on a shelf for 99 cents on clearence, it's still not worth it because it's such a bad game.\n",
      "Back in the day games were difficult and these are no exception. Without some sort of guide to walk you through it, you could spend hours racking your head against the wall because the game is so vague about things that you don't know where to go or what to do. Not the best story, either.\n",
      "Okay, let me start by saying I'm the biggest FF fan in the world. No question.  But this game was like all old and {edited} and stuff. Nothing near the greatness that is FINAL FANTASY 7. The graphics are all terrible, nothing like FF7's. Did they think us super fans wouldn't notice how terrible this was if they just put two terrible games in the package? Shame on you Square. I don't know how I'm ever going to forgive you...\n",
      "This game is pathetic.  The gameplay is like any cut-and-paste first-person shooter, and is therefore boring.  The GHOUL-2 engine is a good idea, but the way it was executed was pathetic.  Okay, so you're telling me in real life if you take a slash at someone's face with a pocket knife, you will abruptly take out a 2-inch by 2-inch chunk of flesh and bone from their forehead for no apparent reason?  And that if you fire at a guy's chest with any weapon all you get is a 2-dimensional hole, with absolutely no 3D effect on it, unlike the head and limbs, and only if you shoot it perhaps five or six times with a shotgun it will be blown into a big red slab of what looks like meat, that will disappear in six seconds?  That you can shoot off a guy's leg at the hip with a Micro-Uzi?  That if you do blow a guy's arm or leg off at the shoulder or hip the severed limb mysteriously disappears?  Please.  Other games didn't have this type of gore effect, but that's what makes them superior to this; at least they don't try and fail miserably.  That's what is truly sad: the developer striving to be revolutionary but just ending up with something that pisses you off at the unprofessionalism of it.Not only that, but the aiming device sucks.  It's a poor attempt at mimicking the Tom Clancy game dot and sight iccon that increase in diameter signifying the innacurateness of your weapon.  But in this one, it's always crosshairs, and if you stand still and shoot one round with your Micro-Uzi, you can hit an enemy precisely in the head at any range if you aim for them.  How frickin' dumb.  And also, a highly-trained mercenary with experience like a Green beret goes all John Woo-style and uses two handguns at once, or two Micro-Uzis at once.  Okay, the military DOESN'T TEACH ITS TROOPS TO DO THAT CRAP!!!  Realism my arse.It's a very long game, but is very, VERY boring.  All the missons are the same: go down a linear path, getting more weapons, shoot people, blast them to pieces.  Even if there is a random scenario engine to create missions for you to do in different enviroments, it's still all the same, only the maps change.The voice acting is terrible, the poor and stereotypical plot twists were easily perceptible from miles away, the plot itself was terrible, everything about this game was downright retarded.  Now, normally, I don't care about graphics in the videogame, but the gameplay and plot was so terrible I have the right to complain about them for once.  Simply put, they're horrible.  The character models are blocky and generally lame to look at (which makes you wonder why the heck it has such high system requirements), the enviroments are completely bare and unrealitic, the GHOUL-2 engine was poorly executed (whoever designed that must have been on drugs, so was whoever described it as being ultra-realistic).  There is nothing good about this game.  Nothing at all.  It wasn't fun, it didn't impress me in the slightest, it was the exact opposite of what they advertised it to be, it isn't worth any amount of money greater than $1.00.  Now, if you have very, very low standards, go ahead and buy it, and have fun blowing people's heads off with a shotgun (how original), or blowing their limbs off, or cutting their head, arms, and legs with a combat knife with a few weak swipes and try to mutilate their torso before it blinks into nonexistence, but it gets old real fast, and it makes you wonder why the developer ever gave permission to pass this off for being \"ultra-realistic\".And, for yet another attempt at creating a halfway-decent game, the developers decided to put a little stealth meter so you can get the impression that you can sneak around and use some type of strategy.  However, if you crouch and sneak up on someone, they'll hear you because of their super-sensitive ears, turn around, and shoot at you, but if you crawl on your stomach, you can get right up to them, bump into their legs, stand up, and slash the back of their heads, without anyone noticing, even if one of your enemies is standing three feet away with his back to you.  What the heck is with this game and a lack of realism?Man, I am so mad I paid $50.00 for this piece of crap.  Don't bother, save your money, and go buy a good FPS, like Red Faction, Unreal Tournament, even Postal 2 (as sad as it may be).  A general rule: if a game is going to have a crappy excuse for a plot, then just exclude the plot altogether.  That's what makes Postal 2 superior to this, even though it is a second-string game.\n",
      "Let me start off by saying what everyone else is generally saying about this game: the graphics [are bad]. The graphics are about as good as the old playstation 1. The characters and environments look blocky and lack any detail. The graphics are so bad they even make the game difficult - it's hard to tell which direction you're going because everything starts to look the same.The gameplay is mediocre. Running seems slow and awkward, rather than speedy and fluid. The gunfire is interesting - the weapons really kick, so aiming is more realistic. Otherwise SOF plays just about like any other first person shooter.This game is touted for its \"realistic\" weapons damage. Hitting different parts of enemies' bodies results in different body parts being blown off. Call me crazy, but I don't think sadistic violence can make up for a poorly designed and executed game. At any rate, you have to be really close to even notice, so it's not a big deal. Overall, this game is so bad, I regret spending the five bucks just to rent it!\n",
      "This game is an absolute insult to the gaming capabilities of the xbox.Graphics - on par with a second grade PS One game.Ambience - Repetitive sounds and lack of sound control (crouching produces as much foot-noise as walking) destroy any hopes of creating any element of suspense.AI - rather read as AS for Artificial Stupidity.Controls - they work well (hence the single star).Overall, I recommend that if you are looking for a FPS, save your money and wait for the releases of Ghost Recon (Island Thunder) or Medal of Honor (Rising Sun).\n",
      "This is another PC ported game that is a complete miss. Like some PC ports that end up on the XBOX,they are better than the PC version but not with Soldier Of Fortune 2. This game looks bad graphically and plays terrible with lousy AI. There is no excuse the XBOX is far capilable of more and this is unexcusable game,I thought the PC verison Soldier Of Fortune 2 was bad but this port is worse. However the ported game does get rid of the annoying fog issue like the stupid PC title,so that is one positive. BOTTOM LINE:NOT EVEN WORTH A RENTAL,BUT AS FAR AS BUYING SAVE UP FOR QUALITY GAMES[HALO,DOA3,NINJA GAIDEN,SOUL CALIBUR 2,HALO 2(MID 2004),DOA 4(TBA)]\n",
      "I'll tell anyone with an ear what I think about this game... or 2 eyes to read my review. It is absolutely awful. Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!For those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!Plot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.Characters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. \"Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs.\"Gameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a \"singer\" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.Music: *gag*Overall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one. If you buy it, I very much hope you are only buying it to melt it into unrecognizable plastic so it can be recycled. Otherwise you are encouraging this scatter-brained drivel to be reproduced in the future.\n",
      "Im going to make this simple, if your a traditional Final Fantasy fan who enjoyed Cecil, Bartz, Cloud, Zidane and all those great guys then skip on this game, its titled Final Fantasy but it completely strays from the path, the only positive is the graphics but the story and game play are awful\n",
      "Wow, i thought that final fantasy series would be the best series ever, well i was wrong, i've played ff from 1 to 10, except for the 3 that never reached the states, well, this games simply sucks, it looks great, great sound, the interesting clothes changing in the middle of the battle, the excelent battle system, wow at first you look at the game as the thing that you've been expecting for so long, but then you see the reality, chapters, one chance to do some things, and the incredibly torturing percentage system. To speak more clearly, there are some things that you can do only once, if you fail on doing it, you have to reset and retry it, there are people that you can speak with to advance in the percentage and there are people that you should avoid to advance in the percentage, if you speak to somebody you shouldn't in the chapter you'll miss the percentage needed to see what you came looking in this game, then if you miss something you cannot do it again if you're in a different chapter.It's confusing the fact that you cannot do everything when you see the people or get the mission, because you've to do some thing in the 3 chapter to get +3% but you can do the same thing in chapter 1 but you'll get 1%.To really \"enjoy\" the game, you need a gameguide, TO BE READING ALL THE GAME ALONG (the official one won't serve you by the way), you need something done to get all the percentage, the game has five endings but only one ending that you wan't to see, the 100% ending because the others just suck.In conclusion, the traditional talking to people and nice walking around the world is jeopardized by the fact that you're going to screw it talking to somebody you shouldn't until chapter 4 or 3, causing it to give you less percentage or not giving you percentage at all. Those people you saw with bad eyes because they constantly use game guides to beat the games, well you'll become one of them with this game.True FF fans avoid it at all costs, this game sucks big time, just stick to the story of the X and you will remain happy with Yuna and his friends.People of Square, Hironobu Sakaguchi... what where you thinking when you created the percentage system? i can see now why namco is gaining ground on the rpg games.\n",
      "I was skeptical of this game from the start, but I bought it anyway because games with female lead character's amuse me. Let's see what was good about this game.........................................................................................................................................NOTHING!!!! A game where all you do is run around and play dress up. WOW!!! That will appeal to masses ( If your a 12 year old girl ). Any rpg fanatic like me has nothing but respect for Squaresoft and the Final Fantasy series, but my respect level has gone down a few points. I'm sure Squaresoft will be more careful in the future after the horrible reviews this game has received ( I was surprised to see there were actually some high reviews on this game here at amazon ). But no one who knows what good rpg's are all about will give this game a good review. Talking about this game makes me lose my temper so I'm going to quit now.\n",
      "Where to start?  Sigh, just thinking about this game gets my blood boiling.  I can't for the life of me understand why some people are giving this 5 stars.  Well, first off, just let me say that I am female.  It should be glaringly obvious that this game is targeted towards a female audience (or so Square-Enix may believe).  Unfortuneately, I was sickened by this game.  Well, let's start with something good.Graphics (10/10): Not bad at all.  I'm not too picky about graphics and I can honestly say that these are pretty good.  Bright, shiny, nice for a PS2 game.Music (4/10): Honestly, this is a matter of opinion, but I didn't like the mix of jazz, techno and pop that made up this soundtrack.  The final fantasy series is known for its beautiful classical-style music, and this game is a huge departure from that.  The airship music made me want to turn off the sound and put a previous game's soundtrack into my cd player.  The only song I really liked was \"A Thousand Words\".Characters (0/10): This section may even deserve a negative rating.  It's like Square-Enix decided to make a game just for the women out there-except they chose the top 10% of the female populous that were the most stupid, shallow, and air-headed people they could find for advice on what to put in this game.  This game gives real women a bad image.  Yuna, a mature, intelligent character I love from FF10, has been kidnapped and replaced with a body double who has the intellect of a card-board box covered in glitter.  I mourned the loss of the real Yuna.  FF10 Yuna grappled with such deep and complex issues as self-sacrifice and questioning her faith, FF10-2 Yuna likes playing dress-up and uses words like \"dissasteriffic\".  Honestly, the other two characters are no better; they are just as shallow and stupid.  I was actually excited about the all-female cast, I was expecting the intelligence-level of the female characters from FF10--not to be found here.Story (1/10): Wow.  This story is vapid. It starts out promisingly enough-Yuna views a sphere of someone who looks like Tidus, and sets out to find out if the impossible task of ressurecting him can be accomplished. The rest of the story falls apart from there. The vast majority of this \"story\" is made up of mini-games and side-quests.  Now, I like sidquests and mini-games as much as the next person, but there's a reason they have the words \"side\" and \"mini\" in them.  They are supposed to take a back-burner to the main story.  In this game, it's the other way around: the main game is composed of one dull, uninteresting sidequest/mini-game after another, while the main storyline takes forever to emerge/develop.  By the time the main story finally got around to being focused on, I no longer cared.Battle System (6/10): I had no real qualms with the actual battle mechanic. The system is a variation of turn based that is rather fast -- battles move quickly and your characters move around the field, helping you break out of the \"let's all line up and attack\" feel of previous games (which I actually didn't mind at all).  I must say that the Dress-sphere system itself is actually a rehashed version of the Job system from FFV.  Except in FFV it felt serious and mature-here it feels like you're playing Barbie dress-up.  Also, unlike FFV, you usually need to switch outfits in mid-battle, which slows battle down in an irritating fashion.  Another complaint that brings down the score in this section is the irritating phrases of your characters in battle.  Just listening to Rikku sqeal out another irritating inane phrase makes me cringe.Gameplay (0/10): If the rest of my review isn't enough for you, here's the final nail in the coffin. I was excited when I heard this game would be non-linear.  I thought it would be like Chrono Cross, where there was a story that you moved through, but certain key decisions (i.e. choose to rescue a character vs. not doing so) made along the way would affect future plot points.  Not so here, it is a mission based system with almost no direction.  The only real effect skipping half the inane crap does is to keep you from getting the perfect ending.  Things as small and pointless as forgetting to talk to one random NPC in chapter 2 could make you miss 1/2 a point which would prevent you from getting that perfect ending.  The effect of this is that you must follow a guide to the nearest letter, thus ruining any feeling of \"non-linearity\".  Oh, and all those \"fun\" sidequests you'll be doing aren't fun at all.Overall score (1/10)- *NOTE that this is not an average, it's my subjective feel of what this game deserves.  As for whether you should rent or buy this, I suggest neither.  In fact, if you're a fan of the original FF10, I suggest you forget this game ever happened.\n",
      "Every jappanese game I have played has nerdy, [*], irritateting dialog. It is so bad that they realy need to add an option on these games that let you skip all story line and dialog and just play the game. Since the dialog in the first final fantasy was so annoying, you would have to be a NERD to shell out money for the the second edition.\n",
      "I think most RPG gamers expected something decent out of this game. Beinga hardcore gamer myself, and someone who loved its prequel FF 10, I was jumping to buy 10-2.First off, let me say that this is the only Final Fantasy game I EVER RETURNED! Thats right, i keep all my games, even the average ones. This one however I had to return due to its \"piece of junk-ness\".FF 10-2 revolves around a trio of girls, 2 of which were characters in the previous FF 10 game. They go off on their adventures doing this, doing that, and in general, you don't really know quite what they are doing. Unlike regular Rpg's where you have a story, and a plot, this game sorta starts with you in your little flying ship able to go everywhere. Its like gigantic minigame. The places you go to don't really have any story, you just land at place A, fight monsters, get some item, and your done. Saying this, there are some awesome mini-games in FF 10-2, which was surprising since most recent Final Fantasy games have failed with minigames.Now, onto the irritating part. You get to play 3 girls as characters. 3 annoying, teenie-bop girls. Girls who are what, late teens? Except they act like they are 9. They run about saying \"oh poo\" and other similiar phrases. Plus they take baths in skimpy underwear, and massage other girls, and walk about in thongs and skin tight outfits. MMM as a 40 year old gamer, I immensely enjoyed it (NOT!). The game looks like it programmed by experienced Japanese gamers, but created by their 9 year old daughters, and designed by their 11 year old horny sons. To gain abilities and powers you have to change into outfits. Thats right, you change your girl's clothes to gain abilities. And each outfit is tighter and more revealing than the last.The game looks beautiful, definitely as great or better graphics as FF 10. But thats all the game excel's at, graphics. No plot, no story, very very bad dialogue and character development (unless you count bra's and thongs as development). There are some very good minigames, and of course the grapics look stunning (did i say that already?). But if you aren't a 11 year old kid, you will hate this game. I couldn't even push my way through the dumb parts, I got disgusted with the game half way through and had to return it for something decent.\n",
      "What is this game? I have no idea. Final Fantasy X was very good. This is supposed to be it's sequel??? This is hardly a sequel if even a Squaresoft game at all. What were they thinking? I feel ashamed that it has inherited the Final Fantasy name and I think it was somewhat disgraced it. Let's look at some of the &quot;new&quot; things. First off, people complained that FFX was too movie like and there wasn't enough choice in the sequence of events til the very end. So what they have decided to do is take out all boundaries what-so-ever and give you almost total free reign on the world. Instead of guided free reign such as most Final Fantasys, you can go pretty much wherever you want and could beat the game without having really even skimed the surface of the other playable features. From the moment you start, you are given access to a flying ship. It seems as if they didn't write enough story for the game so they simply used the worlds they had already created for FFX for you to roam around in with new minigames. Next, what's with the changing of the victory theme?? The famous victory theme from almost the beginning of Final Fantasys has been changed for the sake of THIS game? How could Nobuo Uematsu let them do that? You can really tell who this game was aimed at. I mean, no secret characters, and you change your abilities by changing clothes. Final Fantasy fans, please raise your hand if this appeals to you? I can't say it wasn't entertaining somewhat (thus the one star) but mostly that was from laughing AT it. When you look at how other Final Fantasies evolve story wise, there are always major events that happen that change your story or plot is a big way towards the middle of the game. Not here. The only big things that happen are at the end. The old lesson with movies applies here as well. Sequels aren't usually as good as the originals. Here it is so to a much greater degree. FFX kicks the pants of this game, no contest. For those who liked FFX, this isn't FFX and doesn't compare at all.\n",
      "Let me sum this up quickly: This game sucked, and it sucked hard... and I'm only talking about the twenty-five hours I could bear playing it.  I am absolutely STUPIFIED at how multiple videogame magazines put out nearly perfect reviews on this game!  Square must have paid them off or something, because this game was not imaginative, fun, or even have a storyline worth thinking about.Storywise, it's so non linear you just want to cry.  Most moments are spent wondering &quot;where do I go now?  No, really, WHERE do I go?  I because no one seems to be saying anything useful about where I should go.&quot;  Sure we like non-linear stories for the purpose of making the individual gaming experience unique for every player, but did you have to go as far as &quot;okay, no hints, just bumble along!&quot;  It's so non-linear, you can actually miss nearly HALF the game (actually, I finished chapter 1 with I think 25 percent complete. *_*)  It's so non-linear, even having the strategy guide won't help you make sense of the game.Gameplay: Exploration is a pain, since you're not sure if you're even on the right part of the planet most of the time.  The battles are even worse, since you have to spend half the time switching outfits to get the status bounuses on each dress map thing.Characters: I know Yuna deserves to have some fun after saving the world, but I mourned for Yuna, because she seems to have died and was replaced by some ditz I want to hit with a blitzball.  I want to know what Square was on when the thought of the Lenne thing, because I don't get it, and I don't think I want to get it.The premise was sooo promising, and... to steal/paraphrase part of a line from Red Dwarf, &quot;A word has yet to be invented to describle how this game is, but you can be sure this game is utterly and totally so.&quot;  It's not a flattering word, indeed.\n",
      "This game was so disappointing. I mean Yuna was a smart, all together character in FFX, and in this game they make her into a ditsy, gun toating, diva. Not to mention the fact that there are no weapons to equip, and i won't even get started on the silly dresspheres.  Like other reviews have stated, i agree i have no idea who this game was supposed to appeal to and it makes me worry about the upcoming Final Fantasy games.\n",
      "I read a lot of reviews on FF X-2, and though I love FF games, well lets say X-2 sucked and bad, and I am a female, and I though this game is not interesting. I gave the game back to game stop. FF X is a great game, but I don't know what happened in FF X-2.There are a lot of stupid side quest, which I could not stand. It drove me nuts.The game characters looked really weird in my opinion.I didn't think the graphics were all the great, ok I guess, and the story line sucked. I did not enjoy the battle system.I would highly recommend renting FF X-2, before you buy this game.\n",
      "this isnt a proper final fantasy this is final fantasy with crappy dance sequences. ok this game starts of with a dance sequence with someone {if youve played ffx} who was up tight and a selfless hero in this she's one of the spice girls literally its like three spice girls pain=scary spice {buch and acts like a man only shes white}rikku=baby{bloody irratating the worst game character ever}and yuna=ginger{she doesnt no her place) and the new yuna in this game detracts as much as sofia coppola does in godfather part three the fighting style gets put down by dress spheres look i love final fantasy every single one except this this game belongs in hell with hitler\n",
      "Imagine if they made Romeo and Juliet 2, and they had Romeo and Juliet come back to life and live happily ever after.  Now you know what Final Fantasy X-2 is all about.Now that I know how FFX-2 turns out, I don't have need to keep my original FFX copy that I always thought of as a classic treasure.  FFX had a definite ending, and realistically it was about one thing, a tragic romance.  When FFX-2 was announced, I think it was obvious how it would turn out, and it does turn out that way.  I was a bit surprised that the developers of the game where this predictable.  I kept telling myself, something else has to happen, it can't turn out like a Disney fairytale, but deep down inside I think I knew it.Anyway, as far as I'm concerned I just needed confirmation that this was true, so that I wouldn't waste my time playing the game.  I don't think I'll ever play another Final Fantasy game again.  The Final Fantasy train stops here.\n",
      "I mean i've seen bad games but this is a new low for what was a great RPG.  Leave it as is, plus its much more frustrating.\n",
      "As the title says this is the worst game of the year. There are some major flaws in the game that give it the 1/5. First of all the gameplay. Terrible, absolutely terrible. You run around using difficult controls, bad camera angles and even worse fighting sequences. Come on, if your gonna battle then battle. You have to stand there and get hit (just like all of the other FF's), then when you finally choose the attack you want to do you've already lost alot of life. Next, the voice acting. The worst I've ever seen (well, besides Sonic Adventure 2 Battle that is). And whats with the Charlie's Angel's theme? Three girls battling evil. Uh, Square Enix, thats already taken, but nice try. Trust me do not go for this title. It is a waste of your money. Instead of meaninglessly spending money on this title purchase Kingdom Hearts. Its less expensive and alot better.\n",
      "yeah thats what isaid back in '99 when it first came out. now when i bought it again hoping for a nice little trip down memory lane I was like &quot;HOW MUCH DID I PAY FOR THIS!!!?!?!?!&quot; yeah not good. there isn't even a multiplayer mode on it. and the chao system isn't even half as advanced as the one in SA2Battle. the framerate is worse than it was back on dreamcast. i gave it a 1 but i wish i could have gone lower. its outdated poo. but hey if you actually want to play through all the boring challenges and stuff you can unlock....drum roll please. GAME GEAR GAMES!!!! oh yeah and they are really aweful as well. so yeah the only thing that I think this game has going for it is its pretty box art. other than that...stay away please. if you wanna spend $40 on a sonic game, pick up the Mega Collection. those games a fun.\n",
      "This game could have been a great game had bethesda finished it. I am sure that they were pressed for time but to release a defective product there is no excuse! they should have recalled the game. insted ,all they did was issue an e-mail to stores to expect returns. and even if you follow the step by step instructions from the bethesda site on how to keep the game from freezing or reseting it does not work, believe me I tried many times! the game is rather fun when it's not malfunctioning however it becomes quiet irritating when you have been at sea for an hour sinking ships only to see your game freeze!!! arggghhh!!! so i could not take it any more and returned the game back to the store for a full refund.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ALL OF THEM ARE DEFECTIVE!!!!  SHAME ON YOU BETHESDA SOFTWORKS!!!\n",
      "NBA Baller for the XBOX is such a poorly executed game. It has excellent graphics, fluid animation, good music and lots of player customization. You can create name your character, the way he looks and what clothes he wears. Then you can set his attribute skills, like how well he dribbles the ball, shoots, slam dunks, speed and so forth. The main problem with NBA Baller is that the game cheats! You dribble the ball away from the cpu player, go near the basket, shoot the ball and score points. Then you have to play defense and try to prevent the cpu player from scoring, but you will see the A.I. always catch-up and surpass your score. It is so fake! Another problem with this game is that it is played 1 one 1 basketball, there are no teams, very few rules and no strategy in the game. This results in a boring experience. There are so many better basketball games out there that you shouldn't bother with this junk.Pros:+excellent graphics+excellent controls+good music+character customization+set character attributesCons:-CPU catches up-CPU cheats-super long load times-half court gameplay-no teams or team mates-one on one gameplay-gets old really fast-needs more game modes-no adjustable camera\n",
      "Really, do they really expect us to pay $50 for a game thats not worth $10?!? Its one on one for god sakes! WHo wants to pay the maximum amount of money for a game for a basketball game, when you cant even play real basketball. And who in the name of anyone came up with the idea to ball for cars and items!??! thats totally lame! Sure, it would be cool if it was real basketball with the extra one on one FEATURE. But when its just one on one without the real basketball feature, ouch, this isn't going to do very well:(\n",
      "Ok to start out this review I will try to be nice by saying that the idea for this game was really excellent-start as an average baller in the streets and work your way up to be the best balla ever. along with fame comes money, friends, cribs, cars, bling, and new moves. Excellent idea for a game, right? Well the only problem about this is that this game SUCKS BAD. just the first competition is extremely hard and the controls are beyond me-they have the weirdest moves in the weirdest places. plus, right when you start it just jumps you right into a tournament with no prior training, expirience, or well any basic knowledge of the game.  What I thought would help me here was stat building, right? WRONG. You see I made it so that my 3 pointer gage was as high as you can make it in the game, yet i made 1 out of the 27 3 pointers i shot in the dang tournament. Thanks for tricking me into thinking stats actually effesct how good you are. plus the create-a-player is REALLY sucky. trust me, this is NOT the game you want to be buying, it deserves the fireplace and nowhere else(except maybe the sewer) PLEASE listen to me and dont waste your money and time as I did mine. Trust me the further you stay from this game, the better off you will be.\n",
      "Disappointing game. Saw this in a video store once and ever since then was searching for it. Amazon just happened to have a copy so I purchased it. Played it and the characters are quite amateurish - when they talk mouths do not move, movement is quite cumbersome, etc. You drive an 18-wheeler semi through the contryside in an attempt to gain favor with your mother who owns the trucking business. You can crash into buildings, cars, cop cars, motorcycle gangs. You do battle with these elements as well. Vehicle upgrades are available but the money that it takes to upgrade is incredible - the money you make on a delivery is soon gone just to buy gas. You can borrow money from a loan shark but the interest they want is also incredible so anything/everything you earn is quickly gone. Anyway, Amazon was the only place that had this game and I gave it a try. Disappointing game.\n",
      "What a joke! This is just as bad as The Fellowship of the Ring game. I really don't see how this game is rated above 1 star. If you want to play a real LOTR game, get EA's Two Towers and Return of the King. Vivendi just doesn't know when to stop. Another useless game that will find its way into the discount bins.Hey it's your money, I just like buying games that are worth the money I spent. Fair warning: rent the fellowship of the ring and the hobbit first before buying!!!\n",
      "I really don't know how hard it is to make a battling engine fun. The creators installed bad camera angles. They also made the fighting bland. These 2 things combine to make the game a less-than-average expierience. The camera can affect you during platform jumps. If you want a platform game get &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;. If you want a fighting game get Tekken 2. If you want a great game simply avoid &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.\n",
      "YOU NEED TO BE A MAGICIAN OR A COMPUTER GEEK JUST TO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME INTO YOUR COMPUTER. I BOUGHT THIS GAME  TWO MONTHS AGO AND HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA ON HOW TO GET IT TO RUN AND I HAVE A TOP OF THE LINE COMPUTER WITH LOTS OF POWER.\n",
      "The first warning I got that perhaps Rhem was not going to set any records for standards was on installation. &quot;You will need QuickTime 4!&quot; it informed me. &quot;Here is the website to get it!&quot; A quick search confirmed it: they require QuickTime (an older version at that) but don't supply it. You have to go to the Apple website and download it yourself. Is that impossibly hard, does it mean the game is useless and mean? No, but it's a flashing red light all the same: the game is not going to be helpful. You want a shortcut, something on the Start menu, access to the game in any fashion? Go get it yourself.Rhem feels and plays like a 1992 attempt to be Myst, with the bad graphics, cheap memory-stingy movement, and dull storyline that we've come to associate with the era. The scenery is machines, machines, machines. I lost patience with it in record time and hope I never get bored enough to go back to it.If you played the original Myst and haven't used your computer for anything but spreadsheets since then, you might find Rhem mildly diverting. Otherwise don't bother.\n",
      "DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this game for your PC.  It is marked down for a reason.  This game is causing all kinds of problems on many systems; go to UBISOFT.COM and read the PC forums.  You will find many people are in the same boat.  If you have a CDRW drive the game will not even install properly.  Even when I did get it to work (it was beautiful by the way) it froze my entire system and my computer is not even a year old.  I have a GEFORCE 4 card with updated drivers and it still crashed.  Save yourself the headache and get it for a gaming platform like XBOX; you spend a few extra bucks but it is worth it.  I couldn't return my copy so I sold it to some kid.  You have been warned!\n",
      "Ubisoft incorporated the copy protection software knows as Tages into XIII. This is singlehandedly the worst copy protection known to man. It's so bad that if you have a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive in your computer, the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game won't run. If you have CD or DVD burning software, or anything even related, or any virtual drives, the same will most likely happen; defective installation. The game's &quot;Minimum Requirements&quot; are a lie since they're so low, and you need brand-new, up-to-date drivers for all your hardware. Not only all that, but the game straight out doesn't like some CD/DVD-ROM drives and thus won't install properly, or even at all. Ubisoft support does nothing.After all this, you'd think they were protecting a really nice game. But, no. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug/crash help. The game also spans 4 CDs (for no apparent reason - the game is very short) that seemingly randomly need to be changed (more copy protection). This leads to scratched discs you can't duplicate, thus you must buy the entire game again.The game is beautiful and mildly entertaining, albeit short, buggy, and contains terrible voice acting and a horrid saving scheme. That's if you can even get it to install! What a waste of money.Beware!\n",
      "My computer freezes when I try and play this game which is completely and totally amazing to me.I just got done playing Doom 3 which is far more of a resource hog.  So, I can only guess how good this game is.  I even went online and got the update.  So, my advice is don't waste your money.  It is a dog.Update:  OK, I did some research, which I should have done first... there is pretty much no way to play this if you have a CD burner... the game thinks that if you have the software to burn cd's you'll try and make illegal copies of the disk!  Instead of burning copies, I think I'll just burn the original.  Or perhaps drive over it with my car.  And then burn it.  Or perhaps.... stupid Ubisoft!\n",
      "Game is a total joke and a waste of money. Storyline just jumps from one topic to another, its hard to keep up with whats going on. The save system really ruins the game with is making you start at the beginning of level or two levels in a cheap attempt to make the game seem longer. AI is worthless and almost comical at times as they get stuck in between walls and fail to sound alarms when they spot you.\n",
      "For all those reviewers who couldn't make this game work with their video cards, don't feel bad about it; just get your refund and thank your lucky stars that you didn't try to play the wretched thing.I'd really like to have a word with the idiot who designed the user interface. There are several ad-hoc standards for interaction and motion, and URU uses none of them. The involuntary switch between first and third-person viewpoints is clunky and confusing. (Try Schizm II for a good example of how to do it, lads).There is no conventional save and restore mechanism: the game 'remembers' your latest position and restores you to the start of that level when you restart the game. Infuriating.Although several of the puzzles involve moving objects, the only way the system allows you to do this is by nudging them with your feet. What was the designer thinking about!Now that I've got further into the game, my initial impression of the graphics has improved: although much of the interiors are that muddy grey/brown typified by games like Morrowind, there are a few nicely-rendered scenes. Backgound music is sparse, and the samples are too short - after the third or fourth iteration, even a pleasant tune becomes irritating.Quite frankly, the game looks like an attempt to capitalize on the Myst branding by a bunch of money-grubbing hacks who wouldn't recognize a playable adventure game if one jumped out from behind a bush and bit their leg off.Biggest disappointment of the 2003 gaming season, I'd say....\n",
      "Running with AMD Athlon XP 2500+, Radeon 9600, and a gig of RAM, so no technical or performance problems.The game itself is the problem. The user interface is terrible. Character movement is clumsy and imprecise.The game itself seems pointless, an aglomeration of nothing in particular for no discernible reason. As many have remarked, probably the base URU was originally intended as a small set of training levels for online play, which at the present does not look like it is ever going to happen.Running around the desert at the beginning for no reason at all with nothing much to do or see was the most fun I had with the game; and that was not much fun. It was all downhill from there. There is no coherence to the game experience that I could discern. The puzzles are just stuck in, they do not feel like part of the story. Indeed the \"story,\" is really just a shell of a building without an interior; again the story itself was something that would be expected to develop in the online play.Overall, I found the atmosphere, the music, the ambience, and the art to be rather depressing. I would like to say that there are some good moments that make up for it all, but if there are I never encountered them.Reviews tend to be either love it or hate it when it comes to URU. I would highly recommend trying the demo first before buying the game.\n",
      "Despite the rave reviews by UbiSoft employees posing as customers, Athena Sword, like Raven Shield, is substandard and buggy.UbiSoft has a tendency to buy companies with hit titles, and then have their own development teams produce lower quality sequels, hoping to make sales on the strength of the original games' reputations. Ever since UbiSoft bought Red Storm Entertainment and started producing the Rainbow Six games themselves the gameplay has changed for the worse, the story lines have become increasingly contrived and obviously written with more concern for political correctness than realism, and the bugs have been out of control.There have been over a dozen patches released for Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield since it's release, and Athena Sword has even more bugs. I have never owned a game which required so many patches.The online play is nowhere near as good as Rogue Spear (although better than Counter Strike, if you prefer realistic tactical shooters to the run-and-gun arcade style games) and the single player campaigns aren't challenging enough to provide more than a few hours of entertainment.If you've already bought Raven Shield and are considering buying Athena Sword, my suggestion would be to wait until the price drops, which is closer to it's actual worth. In the meanwhile, there are plenty of better designed user-made levels for single player and multiplayer play available for free download all over the internet if you're looking for more content for Raven Shield.Here are a couple of the problems and bugs found so far:While prone with the M240G Heavy Machine Gun, there is no animation of the belt being fed through the receiverWhile using an Athena Sword weapon the hand and arm models in first person view have holes in the geometryThe SM4 CQB Machine Gun points around a 15 angle upAll of the Athena Sword weapons have the same firing sound with small tweeking, and not the awesome new sounds Ubi promisedThe G3A3 and the G3KA4 appear to be identical to the player except for colorThere are areas where textures which are supposed to be Flagged as false backdrop are not, and the skybox does not show through like it is supposed to\n",

      "I buy most every game that comes out. I have a 1900+ rating in AoC and hovered just below 2k in AoM when I played. I also play most of the other MMORPGS with the exception of DAOC, just not my speed.I have never, ever seen a game that has this many catastrophic flaws and bugs. The server has been down at one point or another nearly every single day since it opened, and that is nothing....A multitude of people have had everything they owned deleted out of the blue, most people have had some significant items deleted at one time or another. It is very hard to move to any new area of town without someone mentioning out loud that they just signed in and 'such-and-such' is now gone.Creatures magically disappear when you fight them, usually just before they die so you get no credit for fighting them. They also teleport in clear view on top of you because the servers are apparently VIC28s.There were a plethora of exploits known in the beta that they chose to ignore and let the people paying to support the game (which is still much less reliable than eves beta was, or EEs beta for that matter, which actually was buggy) use to advance to endgame levels that now have been made unapproachable for months to most. They embraced the \"exploit early, exploit often\" principle, mostly because a number of them play the game online....and also post on the website trashing anyone who has a problem with anything they do (under their player names, which doesn't denote that they are monetarily connected the game to anyone who hasn't happened to get to know them ingame), and delete totally legitimate posts (I have never had one deleted, but many of the ones that get deleted are just being deleted to promote a fraudulent image of the state of the game, which is terrible).Worst of all, there are untold numbers of bugs that were known in the beta that made the game completely unplayable, but they chose to ignore so that they could release the game and force the fans of star wars to pay to support it for them (please keep in mind, I play most MMORPGS, this is so far out of the realm of the minute amount other games have done that it makes Shaq-Fu look like viable product).There was 30 days playing time promised on the box. Out of the 30 days, there was a grand total of 1 that I was able to play without having a fatal error on their end make it unplayable.  Having their faulty code damage stats as if armor was on 2 or 3 times over when no armor was on (making some stats negative :P) and insuring anything that touched you would kill you in 1 hit until the next day (or longer sometimes) when they would finally shake it off your character. Crashing for no reason and killing your character in the process, world comes back up an hour (or day, or 2) later and your character has huge wounds that force you to sit around in a hospitol for up to an hour...WHEEEEE. Deleting all your equipment and your money so you run around with starter gear trying to get money is real fun then. Having havesters dissapear with a weeks worth of gathering in them. Having entire suits of top grade armor regularly disappear when they are bought. All these things and thousands more were known before release and are acceptable to them (call their reps online and ask about the 30 days the box promises, they openely say could care less about any promises made and they will make no attempt to make ammends for charging you to play while their servers are completely unavailable. They released it anyway to make star wars fans (figuring they are loyal and could thus be exploited) pay for what is supposed to be pre-release troubleshooting and quality control.It is a shame and I am frankly stunned that Sony would allow this travesty to be enacted under their name :(-true__ibnFrey(Please save yourselves the frustration, lost time and effort. Eve online runs fantastically and is so well taken care of that it may well be the next long-term MMORPG to make it truly huge, AC2 has finally begun to listen to the gaming community and has been quietly building up a hard-earned fan base, a couple my buds play, Blizzard always comes through and there are other MMORPGS on the horizon (I can't wait for City Of Heroes ^^).)**edit** for the fanboys trying to blame the systems of people who are playing this game and honestly trying to warn other people from getting robbed, here are my specs: hyperthreaded 2.8, 1G RAM, 160Gb hard drive with nothing but 3 games on it, GeForce fx 5200. This game does NOT work...on any system. Every person who has any experience with MMORPGs knows the truth that is the most poorly supported and designed game ever released, it is a total disgrace (eve and ac2 get back to you within small hours, often within 1, average time on tickets is about 3-4 days (long time to go without playing and still being expected to pay for it), and that is on tickets they don't accidentally delete, which has been right about half of them in my experience (which means queing up another 3-4 days wait of not playing).\n",
      "There was a hint of brillence in the first ape escape that you could really admire.  The game tested you in many catagories, and in the end, you were a better gamer than before.  But that was five years ago, and it seems that gamming standards have fallen greatly.I think the biggest creative mistake the developers made was waiting so long to create a true sequal to the debute title.  I mean think about it. The first game was made almost 5 years ago now, meaning the audience it was aimed for at the time is older now.  If they had raised the E rating to T, it would have given the game a lot more potential for a more exciting and creative plot.  It's safe to say that the 'original' fans of ape escape were pretty shocked when they played this game.  You can really tell which of the reviewers on the cite played the first game and which ones didn't.  This game pretty much alienates it's former fans with childlish dialog and way too easy gameplay.As for the characters, you can't really be satified with any of them.  With stereotypes of your everday after-school anime shows, this game really disapoints you.  And no matter what some reviewers say, this &quot;jimmy&quot; is Ash from pokemon.  Whoever said it wasn't, is beeing mistaken by the replacement voice over that the pokemon series used in later seasons. But that aside, it's really annoying, and I liked the original characters more.Even with all the flaws that this game so readily displays, there is one fact that you cannot ignore.  The graphics have without a doubt gotten much better.  But obviously that wasn't enough to cancel out the rest of this games problems.Even tho stories don't really matter in games like this, this story pretty much annoys you to the core.  Sure it was sorta cute at first to see specter in the opening scene, but if it werent for that, the story would be flat out lame.Well as you can tell, from my point of view, this game wash incredibly dissapointing.  I don't think I'll ever think about ape escape the same again.  It went from the coolest game ever, to the coolest game ever with the stupidest sequal.  It's just amazing how many flaws this game had, campared to how awesome the first game was.  After you beat the first game, you truly feel like you've accomplished something by beating such a difficult game.  But when you beat the sequal, you feel as if you've finally completed some tedious never-ending chore.Yes, many things went terribly wrong in the creation of this sequal, but you can never destroy the classics and that is a relief!  But if you won't take my word, and the word of all the other 'original' fans, play this game and wittness the horror yourself.\n",
      "I only got this game becasse it was so cheap.  I was munibulated by its cheapness.  Don't get this game if you are like me\n",
      "Just why video-game designers love amnesiac main characters, I have no idea.  Maybe they can never dream up more creative ways of generating suspense and mystery other than the ol' \"Who am I?\"  XIII's main character is so devoid of colour, so boringly voiced and humourless, that even if the game itself were fun, the very fact that you have to play as an utter nerd for a main character just cripples the experience.But this game isn't fun, either.  Half of this game is an example of just how horribly wrong a stealth game can be when the elements aren't right.As a shooter this game fares somewhat better, but not much more.  Enemies strafe even faster than you and reloading takes forever, and their shots are so accurate that taking cover doesn't really help.  This game is also extremely stingy about giving you ammo (an average enemy drops maybe two shotgun shells and 10-20 bullets).  Frustrating, but at least there's action.  The stealth part, on the other hand, is plain garbage for a couple of reasons:- Who came up with the idea of helmets?  I can't remember another single stealth game where a headshot doesn't kill an enemy.  In fact, the very concept of stealth games is impossible without headshot kills -- unless you have alternate methods of distracting or killing the enemy (Metal Gear Solid's choke/neck-break and noise distractions, for example).- I don't know where main character \"Number XIII\" learned how to shoot, because even un-helmeted enemies seldom die with a headshot.  I've tested this by activating an invincibility cheat code, walking straight up to an enemy, and blasting him in the face.  Nope, still alive and kicking.- No radar.  The \"sixth sense\" in this game which is supposed to replace this basic function is useless, because it tells you where enemies are by means of the \"tap, tap\" of approaching footsteps.  Which means you won't be able to spot an enemy who's a foot to your right, just offscreen.- When special events occur, they use a \"window-in-window\" technique which is interesting visually (a comic-book device), but unhelpful to the player.  You don't know where these events take place in relation to your current location.  And sometimes, you hear an important conversation that's somewhere in your vicinity, but the game doesn't tell you where it's coming from.Give me No One Lives Forever anyday, if first-person stealth/action shooters are your thing.  Cate Archer can kick \"Number XIII\"'s butt any day, and say more interesting things along the way.  I bought XIII from the bargain bin and wish I'd gotten myself a nice dinner instead.  Worth maybe five dollars, no more, and even then, I'd sell it the minute I finish it.\n",
      "I used Atom Man as an example because if you have no idea who this guy is you realize he added nothing to the comic book world.  The game XIII adds nothing to the video game world. The concept of comic book style with a video game is interesting though not a first.  I'm sure I'm not the only one that wonders to myself,&quot;Hey I bought an XBox to play ultra realistic, high graphic powered games.  What's up with cell shades?&quot;  Well my friend, I have the answer... David Duchovny!  They needed to pay this &quot;high talent&quot; actor so much money to make this game that they ran out of funds to produce a graphic masterpiece.  And let us also ponder, how much talking does good ole Dave actually do?  It makes you wonder how much they paid Eve or Mary J Blige or Missy Elliot or whoever plays the girl, who is no Jennifer Lopez when it comes to acting.  That's not a compliment to either.  Anyway, the concept of cell shading was different, but not great, and yes, I know that it fits with the comic book style.  The story was terrible and I found myself just wanting to get to the end just to bring it back to the video store.  I'm done with this one.  Rent it if you can.\n",
      "4 short games, 50 dollars each. Now, 2 games would have been fine. 4 games is a joke. The creators are obviously trying to mooch all the money they can. The first game got repetitive. They have taken it to a whole new level.You still do the exact same things. If you find a great sword you can't use it, but you can give it to the person who wants it. If you get to the bottom theres a boss and a cutscene. Later you go into another dungeon that looks EXACTLY the same as the last one.The game fails to prove it's own worth. Now, if they only made 2 long games, as I have said, that would have been fine. Get a new engine guys, or a new concept. It doesn't work 4 times in a row.\n",
      "...not with a bang, but with a whimper. That's exactly how I felt after finishing this final chapter of .hack. A series that began full of promise has done little except disappoint me.You all know about the series, so I'll forego the plot summary. A lot of people have played apologist for this series, answering the valid complaint of, \"Why are ALL the games the same?\" with a variety of sophistries, but the fact is, this game has little invention in it.I was disappointed in part two because of the ridiculous length of the game (it took me about nine hours). Part three answered this problem, and also had some nice bonuses (such as searching for ghosts of the series characters and finding items for trading), and I was eagerly anticipating part four.So what's the problem here? Not length; this game may be the longest of the bunch (although, it still only clocked in at about 23 hours; I like a little more meat on my RPG's). The gameplay is the same, but hey, that's what we've come to expect. No, the problem here is story, in that this game has little. Most of the questions you might have asked, most of the theories you might have postulated concerning The World won't be answered here. The end of the game (which, though I thought about it, I will not spoil here) is quite unsatisfactory  (ho-hum is the best word I can use to describe it), and in the end, this whole series (which, if you purchased new, will run you around two hundred bucks) left me feeling like I was cheated out of one hundred and fifty dollars. Yeah, I confess; there is enough material here for one game, maybe one and a half, but Bandai has cheated us out of a lot of money, in my honest opinion. Still, I can look forward to Xenosaga 2.\n",
      "This is the exact same game as the other games. There's a few new items, but nothing to celebrate. Sure it's a conclusion, but you just spent 200 bucks on 4 games that are all 12 hours(maximum) long. Way to go!\n",
      "Well I was so excited when I heard that Buffy was getting yet another chance to kick some demon butt in the famous Sunnydale lot, and to my surprise FAITH my favorite Slayer of all time was to be in it.  So I of course got the game like the first day it was out and I played it and well here are the Pro/Cons to the game and trust me there is more Con's then Pro's right now.Con's1. The camera is HORRIBLE.  Very jerky and dizzy at times.  It doesn't go around 360 like the other one.2. The controls are tricky.  In the first game you could use the whole joy stick, in this one it's very strick in that it's up or down and side to side, no slightly up to the left side, nope you just go straight up.  So that is highly annoying because you get cornered very fast (and can't use the camera to use it to swing around fast enough as well).3. Well I do miss the inventory screen, very much.  I mean I learned how to use the quick screen in the first game, but I think it was WRONG to take it out.  Trust me once I beat the game I'm writing a LONG, LONG list of problems this had compared to the first one.5. To many buttons for combo's and highly frustrating.  They really don't give you a chance to figure out moves and spells in my opinion.  They talk to you while fighting how to do it, and that is annoying.6. SAVES!!  Who ever the freaking genuies was to NOT have hardly any in the game needs to be in my eyes SHOT and never allowed to play again.  I was playing Faith and the game got stuck at the end guy so GUESS what I had to start all over again.  UGH.  Plus the Boss who you face at the end of this takes FAR to long to beat.  I mean he should be an end guy it's so stupid.  There are engery balls you have to blast, three of them I sat there counting that i hit one of them 50 times and it still wasn't down and this is ONLY ONE.  That is way to much time to spend in my opinion.The list can go on and on and on and on, the only good part is that you get some multi-player action going on and well... um... the other games as well seem very cool.  But other wise this isn't any where near the league that it was before and if I could demand my money back I would give it up it back.  Even if Faith is in it.\n",
      "I am a huge Buffy fan from back when the TV Show first started. I own all the box sets that are released and I own the FIRST BTVS game for Xbox. I bought this game yesterday at GameSpot for 49.99 without tax. My husband played it for 5 minutes, we looked at each other and agreed, this game BLOWS. It is NOTHING like the first BTVS game on XBox. The graphics are like a PS2 game, most of the time your characters look like they are floating in thin air! The voice acting of the characters is way off including the cast that is actually in the TV Series. They seem like their hearts are not in it. Plus there is no Alyson to voice Willow. Some girl voice actor they hired is doing our favorite witch...except she is majorly annoying, her voice is NOTHING like season 4-7 Willow, and she really doesn't know how to act at all.All in all this game is a real huge disappointment. Do yourself a favor, don't run out and blow your money buying it like I did. Rent it and see if you like it...then if you do fork over the dough. I promise you, if you are a fan of the First Xbox Buffy game you will want to kill the people who made Chaos Bleeds for ruining a great game.I hate that it wasn't good. I hate that it did not meet my expectations...hated it so much I took it back today, traded it in for 20 dollars (way under what I paid) and bought Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic instead.\n",
      "The ONLY thing I liked about this game was that you could beat up little kids, which is fun, admit it. I was dissapointed, being a huge fan of the show.\n",
      "I read some where that this is the simpsons version of Grand theftouto. Yeah Right! This horrible game is nothing like Grand Theftouto. First off, you don't get to kill ANYONE! All you can do is kick them and they just roll on the ground! The police thing is horrible to. In Grand Theftouto, you get a chance to fight the police and even get there guns, but in this if the just come close to you they take your money and the game keeps going. Oh, and instead of throwing people out of the car and taking the car like in Grand Theftouto, you friendly ask the person for a ride and they drive you were you want to go. The missions can not be compared at all with Grand Theftouto. in Grand theftouto, your missions are to kill somone, but in this one of your missions is to give Lisa her homework before the princable gets to school. If you love Grand Theftouto and is thinking of getting this it is nothing like Grand Theftouto.Infact, I would not recamend this game to anyone.\n",
      "A friend lent me his copy of this game - aCoF to evaluate on my machine, just to save me from the possibility of paying full price for a game that won't work well on my machine. I had by then become a devotee of the next newer version - FS2002. While aCoF obviously surpasses FS-2002 on a frame-by-frame basis, comparitive frame-rate more than evened things out for the older game. I knew that the minimum system requirements were conservative, but nothing prepared me for how conservative they were. Despite only &quot;requiring&quot; a 450mhz-class CPU & 128mb of RAM, aCoF ran like a slide-show on my 2.2 Ghz Pentium 4, w 512 MB of RAM, with GeForce graphics acceleration - and that was with options sliders set to 0 or near it. Apparently, software manufacturers like MS believe that they're past the days of having to set the minimum sys-req at half the optimum - now we have to multiply by five to get an honest idea of what's really needed. Though a better graphics accelerator and more RAM, would improve things, personally I'm happy enough with FS2002, and that program looks to have a more permanent place on my PC.\n",
      "The program gets lost in the tutorials and can't correct itself.  If you can't do exactly what the program says to do when the program says to do it, the only way out is to crash the plane and restart the flight.  Thus, one is unable to make any progress.It looked so great, too...\n",
      "Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.\n",
      "Jak 2 is one of the worst games i've played in years!  With unfair levels, difficult situations (like I.E. You agaist and Amry with one gun with only 50 bullets)and frustrating mini games , like keep up with the old lady you have 1 second per symbol.  I spend more time yelling than enjoying the game.  I sugest if your a fan of theof Jak 1 don't getthis game.  Jak acts more like a criminal than a hero.  All i can say is that this game is not worth the money.  DON'T GET JAK 2!\n",
      "Jak 2 has got to be the worst game I have ever played, it has horrible gameplay, storyline, graphics and it just is crappy! I hope you dont waster your money on it! (...)\n",
      "The game's not hard. The developers just disabled the right thumb stick, which makes it a fustrating game... but not hard at all. And it's not the first time i've ever played a game where the developers disabled the right thumb stick, (ninja gaiden black, metro prime), thereby not allowing me to control the camera so that I could adequately play the game. The other platform game, (Sly Cooper), allowed me to move the right thumb stick \"UP AND DOWN\" so that I can effectively make jumps.  Jak 2 however, doesn't allow me to move the camera up and down, and this resulted in me making a lot of \"BLIND JUMPS\" which sent me back to the beginning of EVERY mission. The game also could have benifited from having a camara system that didn't get stuck a lot and follows the movements of Jak faster, weapons with lock on features, and the ability for the player to strafe around an enemy (like in the Zelda series).  The fights in the Zelda series were balanced enough in a fair but challenging way that made fighting all the monsters in that game fun.  In Jak 2 however, it was more of a chore to move through the game, and not all that much fun.Ok now, let me put the brakes on the bitching for a moment. Jak 2 is \"not\" a terrible game.  There are some fun and funny moments to be had in the game. The open world enviorments are great, the music is cool, the pretty much non-existant load times are fantastic, character graphics are good, the story is decent, and amist the many chaotic scenes in the game that involves you fighting in various places and moving through the city, there's no slow down.  And, most importantly, since I only paid $7.76 for this game, I don't really have too many complaints. So the game does have a lot of good points about it.Even though I beat both Jak 1 & 2, (hooray for me and everyone else in the world that did beat them. I have Jak 3 and im going to play that one soon), my only wish was that the developers had allowed me the abiliity to move the right thumb stick \"up and down.\" Games are supposed to be, (first and foremost) fun. They can be challenging, annoying, difficult, and enemies can be redicilously powerful or whatever.  I really don't mind being taken down by an enemy or a boss in a game. However, I feel that I should have a fair chance of fighting against any enemy in any game.  Disabeling the camera stick in any way that makes it annoying for me to \"SEE\" what im supposed to be fighting in the game is not fair, and this is what makes Jak 2 waayyyy more fustrating to play than fun.So... in order for me to lift my review past 1 star and recomending any Jak & Daxter game to anyone, if any of the creators of the game is reading this review, I want to see YOU play \"ALL\" of the missions in Jak 2 \"WITHOUT DYING ONCE ON ANY ONE OF THEM.\" ( since I died on them all and had to replay them all, YOU have to survive them all, without replaying them). Show me how it's \"expertly\" and \"professionally\" supposed to be done. If I see you do this, then I will lift my review to 5 stars, buy all the other Jak & Daxter games, you'll have my utmost respect as competent game programers and designers, my sincere and deepest apology for bashing your game a bit.... and... i'll buy you all a cookie.\n",
      "Jak and Dexter was a darn good platform game.  It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable.  It was basically a fun all around game.  So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse.First off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3.  Let me tell you, this does not work.  GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment.  What does Jak 2 have?  It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it.  The worst is the movement throughout the city.  To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible \"hover vehicle\" that apparently can't hover beyond \"up\" or \"down\".  The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety.  Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game.  I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels.Secondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it \"gritty\".  Oh geez, give me a break.  Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty?  Why does Jak need to cuss?  I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers.  The \"gritty\" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game.  Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level.Okay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say?  Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again.  Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again.  Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later.  While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad.Finally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass.  Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could.  This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else.  This game pretty much is linear.  It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here.So, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas.Pros:Uhmm, I can't think of any.Cons:Pretty much linear.City is mundane.Environments unvaried, stale.Repetitive, tedious levels.Adult for no reason.Hover system is mind boggling bad.Difficulty: MediumFrustration Level: HighHours to complete (my estimate): 25 Hours\n",
      "Oh lord do I hate this video game! It completely changes the Jak and Daxter theme, it's dark and painful in the beginning, I hate Baron Praxis, and there are way too many objectives to do in this game! this sequel does a terrible job living up to its predecessor! Why couldn't they have made this a \"Banjo-Tooie\" kind of sequel: villains rising back from the dead, wanting revenge on the heroes, heroes need to stop them again! That would have been a lot more interesting!\n",
      "Well, Sony has done it again; they have made a completely horrific game, and I don't mean horrificly good, i mean horrificly bad.  PlayStation 2 is too choppy and the framerate is too slow to run a half-decent game.  They release SOCOM II, and Xbox releases Rainbow Six 3, and I know what you're gonna say: &quot;Rainbow Six 3 is on all 3 systems&quot;, well it's only actually GOOD on the Xbox.  No matter what Sony tries, Microsoft will always be two steps in front of them.\n",
      "NO WONDER THEY KEEP DELAYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP,I LOVED ALL THE OTHER GAMES SO I AM DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME!!ITS SO BAD I DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO FINISH OUT THE LEVEL WHICH IS RARE? WANT A ROCKING GAME? TRY &quot;XIII&quot; I LOVED IT!!!\n",
      "I thought I wasted my time writing a review on this crap, but apparently not.  I played it for about an hour and wanted to get rid of it the same day.  Syphon Filter used to be a sure thing, but now it's up the creak without a paddle.  The controls suck, the mission objectives are unclear, and the map is hard to read.  I'd swear the developers that made the previous Syphon Filter editions enjoyable retired and passed on the torch to the makers of \"No One Lives Forever.\"  That game is as fun as having your your legs broken twice a year, every year, for 10 years straight.  I'd give this game 1/2 star if it were possible.\n",
      "When this game arrived at my house, I put it into the computer and a screen came up that said play, options, and something else. I did not say install, and it was supposed to. I called up echnical support, went online, nadda, nothing. The worst $20 I ever spent. Avoid this problem by avoiding this product. Don't let it happen to you. I recommend you get City of Heroes instead. Now theres a fun game.\n",
      "Like a lot of other deceptions, this game is NOT for Windows XP. Baldur's Gate couldn't be programed by official company or fansite(as with Ultima) to run on XP.  It is not possible. The same could be said for Ultima Collecton which stated it was for windows 95 RIGHT ON THE BOX and doesn't run on that os.  Please put the correct OS for this game.Deception #2:  This game only contains what BG Saga contained, Baldur's Gate.  It is not an \"Ultimate\" Collection, so don't expect BG II or ToB. It is just another name for the same thing(and for bux) bottom line, if you have BG, stick with it and play it on your old windows 98 system that your so fortunate to own, don't mess with this! If you don't have BG(by now) then your too young to appreciate it!\n",
      "I just bought this game, the reviews here made it sound great. I am a huge never winter nights fan and after playing that game for a very long time I just couldn't get past the graphics. They are awful. I am sorry but if you are used the graphics of today's games then this game isn't for you. I can't tell you if the game itself is fun to play, I haven't played it. I just couldn't get past the graphics. Sorry bad review from me.\n",
      "What the company did here is paid big bucks to get the movie name and rights to the characters, then no follow through.  Not trusting the company is the reason for a demo.  More demo's please.  Recall the game, \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\"?  Is was a beta for this game.  Now they have better rendering on the characters, but they forgot to put color on the ground and walls.  Everything is black.  Super annoying.  One player. \"How do I get up there?\"  If you hate jumping games, you'll hate jumping games more that they don't finish making.  Keyboard - Extra long jump Left-Ctrl key+direction key+jump key+you can't see because they didn't render the ground or the walls in act 2...it's black.  Major design flaw (act1) with invisible barriers - If you push the butter churn to the fence near the hay stacks, standing on it to jump over, you can't jump back.  You can physcially jump higher than the fence, but they never thought you'd do that and were using an invisible vertical barrier, so you couldn't get there in the first place.  If you liked the book, don't purchase this game or you'll even find the book frustrating.\n",
      "I've been playing RTS games since Dune 2 came out, this is by far the worst example of an RTS I've ever played. It has the most tedious interface of any game... any program I've ever used. The entire challenge of this game is trying to control your units when the simplest commands are unavailable. Select all units? No, you can't, you simply cannot do it. Amazing. After 2 hours of playing this I threw it in the garbage.\n",
      "this game has a great effects trailer, but when you play, there's no fun modes, you don't know what to do, and the graphics are crap and piece of s*** worthy, a 100% letdown.\n",
      "...and in fact, I don't think it is for anyone. For those of you who have played games from the Saga series (Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier 2, etc.), and DIDN'T enjoy the experience, well, you should stay far away from this! However, even those of you who did like those games will probably want to steer clear of this as well.I understand those of you who want to like this game since you sunk fifty bucks into it. I don't blame you; I was right with you. However, I feel rather duped. You see, I purchased this game at a certain electronics store which shall remain nameless. I received about a hundred emails from Square/Enix hyping this game, and indeed, the art of the game box did not suggest static gameplay and water colors. Furthermore, the store would not allow me to look at the instruction book (which is a better indicator of what the game will be like). In the end, a game which was hyped like FF and made to look like FF turns out to play like a very difficult version of Monopoly. In all honesty, this game [stinks]. And the music? Well, if I wanted beautiful classical music, I could purchase Mozart at about a fifth of the price. Shame on you, Square!But don't blame this on Enix. Yeah, Grandia X wasn't so good, but Grandia was OK, and Dragon Warrior is still spectacular.\n",
      "Don't bother to know what it is. I bought it at around $10. Worst than the Final Fantasy's series. Worst than the Dark Cloud series. Worst than the Star Ocean's series. &quot;Something&quot; that should have never seen the light. Not even worth 1 star (but is required to put at least 1).\n",
      "The developer of this game must wake up on the wrong side of his bed. I had no fun playing this game but frustration. It is uninspired and not motivating at all. Once I start playing this game, I turn off the system after about five minutes. I just cannot stand it!\n",
      "Unlimited Saga is a terrible RPG in almost every way. The graphics are horrid, both in the cutscenes and in the game. The music is subpar and cliche'. The game system is completely unintuitive, both on the world map and in combat scenes. The voice acting is disgustingly bad. The city menu is limited and almost useless. If you are a fan of RPGs you may get a few scraps of fleeting amusement out of this game, otherwise you are in trouble. Avoid this game at all costs.\n",
      "Square dropped the ball with this title.  A waste of time on so many, many levels.  An uninspired journey into boredom.The combat system is... not bad.  Interesting.  Different, yes. If the gameplay were even remotely interesting, the combat system would push this into the highest echelon of rpg's.Thing is, the gameplay is *horrible*.  Boring, boring, boring.  There's no animations worth dealing with, everything is 2 dimensional flat cutout images in a pseudo 3-dimensional world.  Exploration is boring.  Interaction is boring.  Everything, in fact, aside from the battle system is... boring.The battle/combat system alone isn't enough to save this game.  Terrible.  Don't waste your time or your money.\n",
      "I ordered this game for my collection.  The ad was very accurate.  The game was shipped quickly & safely.  I would purchase from them again.  The only negative thing I have to say is about the game itself.  Square Enix, who up till now, I held in high esteem for their RPG games.  I am afraid they published a stinker of a game!\n",
      "I bought this game a while ago, when it was at list price, played it after playing several other RPG's, and was stunned,,, but not in a good way.  I gave up after about 4 hours of play and decided I wasn't getting it.  I tried again a month later and lasted 10 hours, still thought that there might be something that I didn't understand.  My last try was about 15 hours, and I can state unequivocally that there is nothing to get.  This is not a good game, not even a mediocre one, for that matter.Perhaps the single most glaring flaw is the non-existent animation.  Outside of some cut scenes and so-so battle action this is in what Square Enix calls &quot;sketch motion&quot; which means - no motion at all.  So help me, one character's sketch appears with a balloon of text, then another, then...  Throw in a barebones mapping facility that does the travel and you have the entire art effort.  This isn't a game, it's a prototype for one.The battle system is almost as bad.  You have to set up all your characters' moves ahead of time, one painstaking button press at a time.  Then, when the action actually starts you have to hit a button while a battle wheel spins.  Most of your opponents actually die of boredom.The story line is doled out in bite-sized bits but what I've seen is pretty run of the mill.  Playing Unlimited Saga is actually painful, as you follow a set of meaningless actions using a game structure that was out of style in 1995.  the best I can say about is that Square Enix must have cancelled the game before the animation, and has published it to try to recoup their investment.Unless you collect total failures, pass this one by.\n",
      "Bought this game very cheap, as it is from a publisher I normally love and trust.Hailed as being an \"extreme\" RPG, I thought a little challenge could be fun (just got done played a series of fun, but easy games.)  Plus, it was cheap.This RPG game is only \"extreme\" in how bad it is...  The difficulty in this game comes from a completely random, roulette wheel battle style, and the fact that every challenge in the game require level 30+ skills to overcome, when you're at level 2.  Seriously, you will encounter a barrel, a door, or a treasure chest and not be able to do anything, right at the beginning of the game.  You later find out it takes a level 30 skill to break or open anything.So, you walk around what is basically a board game playing field, moving a stationary character drawing one space at a time, while random pictures flash in the background.  Occasionally you get in a random battle, which is where the roulette attack wheel comes in.  All your skills are put on a fast spinning wheel, and what you land on is what you do.Or, you encounter a trap.  If this happens, you use the same wheel to try and avoid it, which it early levels, is something like a 1/19 odds.The battles present another huge problem.  You have your standard HP, and you have LP.  LP is your life points, and if a character is attacked while in KO (after HP reaches 0, typically) you lose an LP, and when LP is gone, you're dead for real.  You get shocking little LP... like 2 or 3 at most... which wouldn't be too much of a problem except tiny monsters in random battles do LP damage while you still have full HP!  So, at full HP, a 2 hit kill monster can hit you for an unavoidable 2 LP... possibly killing a character.  This makes HP completely useless...I never found an item that could cure LP, either.There are multiple characters you can play, with different storylines.  A good feature, but the stories (played out through a very few still picture/word sequences) were bland and confused, and none of them sparked my interest enough to possibly warrent played through such an unfun wreck of a game.Not even worth the incredibly cheap price and shipping.  Stay away.If you want an \"extreme\" or challenging RPG with great story, great gameplay try the Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga series.\n",
      "Uh, I can't believe the ever popular Squaresoft, the makers of the world loved Final Fantasy series, made a huge dud. I'm probably one of the most diehard RPG fans out there, but Unlimited Saga? This game is a disgrace! I ordered it off amazon and thankfully it did not ship properly. So I played it at my friends house.I would first like to point out the graphics. The anime style animation is a good idea, but not here. As soon as you start up the game you will have a hard time looking at it. The graphics are all cartoon!Moving around is another problem. You don't move! You point in what direction you want to go, and the screen changes. To me that is a whole chunk of RPG that is gone. And to move around in towns, you press X on the house you want to enter and your there.The battles. Oh geez the battles. Interesting yet boring. You can choose up to 7 attacks to use on one turn using all your characters. You can also pick a small number of abilities. Then you are done and this spinning reel thing shows up. You stop it and attack, either kicking, punching or throwing.......thats about it. Oh, and the enemy attacks!Next is sound. Thsi category isn't that bad. The sounds and music are wonderful. The music being very original and colorful. The voice acting is very poorly done however. There might be 3 characters on the screen and suddenly a voice pops up. You can't really tell who it is, mostly because its a cartoon and their lips don't move.I'm always bummed to see very bad RPG's. They are a waste of money, and you don't really have fun with them. Unlimited Saga could have been great. Spice up the graphics, add a new battle system, and hire the FFX voice people and this game is golden. Sorry Square, but you've built a boat with no paddle.Take my word for it and don't buy this game. Its not like Square to make a RPG like this. I'm just hoping Square will split up with Enix, so they make something worth buying. Don't buy this, its not worth the $... But if you happen to buy it, the only thing worth seeing is the preview for FFX-2!\n",
      "I love Final Fantasy.  I really do.  The World is Square, baby!  (FFI reference).I wasted a perfectly good giftcard on this puddle of cow vomit because of the fact I saw Square on the cover.  I envision, at Square-Enix headquarters, there is a little room in the basement where the company meets its \"hire the handicapped\" quota.  They spake unto them and said, \"Hark!  I speaketh to thee and bade thee...maketh an RPG!\" and the retards made an RPG and Square saw that it was crap...and that it was bad.  Then Square spoke and said, \"Oh ye of little mental aptitude...I thanketh thee for thine efforts...however, now I must smother thou with a pillow.\" and Square smothered the handicapped with a pillow...but not until a few escaped into the battle mechanics room of the Final Fantasy series.The graphics are vile, the characters two-dimensional, and the combat is something right out of one of those little AA games in the plastic armor hanging on a pegboard shelf in K-Mart.  A rusty Tin Man who's had his joints welded together and eyes riveted shut could move with more fluidity than the sprites in this piece of crap.  Also, the game leaves you with a realization of what a storyline is, since you're so busy LOOKING and WAITING for one to develop within this game.I viewed this game as a metophorical giant loog wad of yak-spit right in my suck-hole.  Seriously...Square...FOR SHAME!  This game is the equivalent of my PS2 powering on and then nipple-twisting me until I bleed and finishing up with a swift kick to the crotch.I hate this game more than I hate getting an eyelash stuck in my eyeball...more than when you sit down on a dark leather or vinyl seat in the summer and the nuclear heat sears the skin on the small of your back and back of your knees...I hate this game more than when you go on a water ride at a theme park and your underwear chafe your taint (the area between the crotch and butt).Seriously, I had a colonoscopy about four years ago and I had to drink this oily lemon-lime stuff that made me squirt clear liquid and wasn't allowed to eat anything for 24 hours so that it felt like my stomach was eating itself and I wanted to die.  Well...this game wasn't quite THAT bad but at least with the colonoscopy I knew it was going to be a horrible experience.  This is a VIDEO GAME.  Dance all happy and free while you put it in the system thinking, \"Another AWESOME RPG from Squaresoft!!!\" and then suddenly you're doing the video game equivalent of gagging down a gallon of Quaker State with lime and squirting clear liquid from your o-ring.You think I'm kidding?  Do you KNOW where this game disk of mine is right now?  A landfill.  LANDFILL!  Know why?  Because I THREW IT AWAY!  I was moving and consolidating some boxes and THERE IT WAS on the bottom of a box...staring at me.  I looked around...thought about it...and tossed that piece of twice-tossed monkey dung right in the freaking trash.  Did I want the $3 credit from the gamestore?  NOPE!  I refused to subject any other human being, decent or indecent, to the vile putridity of this shiny circular turd.  I feel guilty that I didn't snap the disk in half first for fear some homeless kid living outside the dump and stealing electricity from a storage shed's power outlet might find this game and try it.If you love RPGs (especially Final Fantasy) avoid this festering wart on the arsecheek of the Sony Playstation 2.\n",
      "This game is a very rushed feel to it, the game seems incomplete and has many good idea's but many things are done in this game with little or no good reason. The map is set up in the format of a board game you must explore. In doing so you can lose the game simply because the board decides to take and scatter your characters dividing them and making it hard to complete simple tasks like killing enemies. Your weapons and gear take damage in this game and over time break. Broken gear is worthless, you also have Hps and life points and if you take to much damage to your life points from taking to much damage from your Hps you end up with game over. This game lacked a lot of polish. And I honestly have to say its darn close to unplayable. I would also have to say it's one of the worse games ever made by Squre Enix, and considering I own most of there games that's saying a lot.\n",
      "There is no Defense in the game and you don't really feel like your skill can do anything to help on defense. You can't control DBs well so its better to just let the computer do it and they can be picked a part by any Human with a little experience with Madden.Offense is all about who has the fastest players and getting it to them which is easy because every QB in the game has the ability to make throws that shouldn't be possibe.\n",
      "This game will stink like the rest of em'.Madden makes the worst football games ever.If you want a fast paced football game go for the 2k series,if you want the best graphics get nfl fever 2004 instead of this.Why do people like the boring games that EA sports dishes out?\n",
      "I know this is Xbox rather than Xbox 360 gameBut I still bought it because I thought it is a great game so Microsoft would offer the update version so I can play in my Xbox 360, you know that right? Lots of games can be player in 360 even if they are just XboxI was wrong...\n",
      "Something bad happened during playtesting for this title. To be precise, it seems like nobody was playtesting it.  A 3rd person camera flicks maddeningly from one bad location to another, constantly leaving your enemies off-camera, making dodging and aiming (not to mention *crate jumping puzzles!*) a complete and utter joke. No surprise the original Dino Crisis development team had nothing to do with this visually beautiful yet disastrous title (Yes, the spaceship is beautiful).To say the gameplay is bad would be doing a disservice: it just doesn't WORK.A big WT_? for Capcom on this unfinished bow-wow.\n",
      "man if you buy this wack game something is wrong with you mentally. i want to write capcom a hate letter for this game. i dont know what they were thinking makin this crap!\n",
      "This game is a disgrace to the mega man name. It's horrible plain and simple. Ugly, too hard, stupid idea overall. Forget this and get X7 for PS2. much better.\n",
      "THis game makes you think it will be good over the first few minutes of cool cut scenes and cool action.  THen you move inside the game ... for the rest of the game it seems.  THen the game loses all coolness.  Somewhere around the fifth room, you realize you have to do the exact same thing in every room.Bottom Line:  Is it fun?  If you like bad action and the same thing over and over again.  Will you keep it?  No way.  Is it for kids?  You blow up robots againa and again and again and again and again and ... you get the idea.  If that is bad for kids well there you go.\n",
      "I heard good reviews about this game and decided to buy it.  At first I thought it was pretty fun, but after the third boss or so, I became tired of it.  I don't know what it was that finally made me realized that this game sucks, but it did it well.  Here is what I think it might have been:-The fighting (became trite)-Special effects (weren't good)-Story line (cliched)-Voices (horrendously inane)-Graphics (nice, but the comic-book drawings were kind of dumb)Methinks that what I hate about the game is excatly what people love about it.  I lost the game so I didn't try finishing it, which doesn't really bother me.  I suggest renting the game before buying.  That will save you money--or it would have for me anyway.\n",
      "Runaway is a Starforce game.  Those of you not familiar with Starforce should read the \"Prince of Persia :The Two Thrones\" PC game user reviews, here, at Amazon.I own and installed Runaway. Its an amicable enough point and click adventure game. There are certainly worse.However, most games don't \"Runaway\" with your computer.After I installed Runaway, and unfortunately for me, two other Starforce laden adventure games, I began to suffer the varied problems that Starforce is reported to cause.I had to replace my hard drive, on a computer new enough to be under warranty.Starforce authors, and the developers that use it, claim it to be a safe, effective means of copy protection. They have also claimed that Starforce detractors are angry gamers that can't copy their games.I've never used pirated software, nor have I ever engaged in commiting the crime. Yet, because I like to play PC games, I have to suffer the consequences of pirating  without beinginformed.Starforce installs hidden drivers on your computer, that cannot be removed easily...if at all.  The company has provided a removal tool for these hidden drivers, but many posts have filtered in that either pieces or even all the software refuses to leave (after its use).Trisynergy did not ask me if they could install hidden drivers on my hard drive that are very difficult and stubborn to remove(that interfere with my own computer's drivers).While I can not prove that Starforce games caused the damage to my computer, I have no evidence that it did not. The excuses and procalamations I recieved from another Starforce using company included and blamed my hardware configuration...after I informed them I had a 17\" Toshiba Desktop Replacement Notebook with a P4 at 3.2Ghz and 1.5 GB RAM. It would be hard, for even me, to wreck the hardware configuration of my notebook.The choice is yours to make.MJH\n",
      "Why did I let myself spend $50 on this game?! ARGH! I've been playing for 2 weeks now, and there is downtime aplenty, bugs, no maps, and item disappearance galore. They even have an item replacement policy on the homepage it happens so much. I am so completely disgusted with this game. Star Wars Galaxies had problems, but there was something to *DO*. There are ACRES of non-content, and server lag will have your characters and MOBS rubber-banding all over.. And I have a fast cable modem. Further, when trying to engage MOBs, you have to chase the thing for 15 feet before you finally attack, usually in the middle of a camp. You never have any idea where you are, there are no maps, no locate &quot;/loc&quot; coordinate system, no &quot;/where&quot; to find NPC's.. I HATE THIS GAME! GIMME MY MONEY BACK!!\n",
      "I downloaded the seven day free trial for this game and it made me put in my credit number. That's the most idiotic thing ever and the very first time that I saw a free downloadable trial of a game that made you put in your credit card. They probably make you put it in so they won't tell you when your seven day trial is over but instead, charge you after it's over without notice. I'm giving it one star just for this reason, it shows that the company is greedy and like to give a lot of BS.\n",
      "Played early beta, was fun. Then they opened it up, too many people. Too much lag. This game STILL (1/19) sucks, save your money for World Of Warcraft.\n",
      "Ok. I'm one of these guys who is basing his review on the demo.The demo I played is no way to get people to buy a game. My characters were killed so fast, it was pathetic. Every time I rested to heal (even for 1 day) I would be surrounded by rats, thugs, or snakes. There was no way to heal my guys because I was taking hits from enemies every time I tried to heal someone.Also, just about every attack I made was a miss while the enemies nailed me almost every time. Even spells were misses on a regular basis.This is definately not recommended.I played Heroes on X-box and had way more fun.\n",
      "Ill get straight to the point: Stay away from this game.I have played The Icewwind Dale series, Baldurs gate 1 & 2 and the excellent Planescape: Torment several time over. They are all great games.When it was announced a PC version of Temple of Elemental Evil, I was very excited. I remember the the thrill playing, and then DMing the PnP version of the game some 15 years ago.And THIS is what they come up with?!? Crap!1. Bugs. After installing the three official patches the game is still bug-ridden: clicking on a character brings up the inv. of another, spells dont work, desktop crashing, numerous clipping issues (which is very rare in 2D game), an interface that seem to do the exact opposite of what you want it to do. etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.2. Tedious. The D & D 3.5 rules does not translate into a computer game. At all. It is that simple. In the Baldurs gate series the game play was fast, intuitive. exciting. In ToEE its a big yawn.The Homlet quest are, with two exceptions, dumb, boring and errand boyish: Tell X to bring me a turnip, get a hammer for the blacksmith, tell X that Y really likes her, play cards with some bum at the inn. You get the idea.....Combatwise it is none the better: I spent som 50 minutes chooping up 2 frogs just to get inside the Moathouse.Had the 50 minutes been exciting I wouldnt mind, but its just a series of going through motions, linear clicking on options on each characters unwieldy radial menu.Accurate representation of combat? Maybe.Fun (which, in the end is why we all play computer games)? If your idea of fun is sticking needles in your eyes, this game is a blast.3. Visuals & audioThe voice acting is in the top 3 worst games ever. A good example is the character Elmo whom you meet at the begining. After the encounter, I was left wondering if this was a joke on the gamers by the makers of this game.The visuals are an anachronism. Great in 1998. Maybe. Today you get better visuals on high-end mobile phones.4. The bugs, incredibly crummy gameplay, DD 3,5 rules, bad visuals and audio coupled with a thoroughly uninspired story makes this a game you should steer clear of.Advice: If you havent played the Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale serie yet: get those.If you have: play them againAnything but ToEE, even if it is in the bargain bin for 2 bucks.\n",
      "What a frustration.  There must be a patch out there I can't find.  This game suffers from such slow game play it is a wonder it was ever released.  Did any of the developers actually bother to play there finished product?  Maybe so but it was too late to do anything about it by then.  You will spend 90% of your time waiting in combat for your turn.  Good luck with it.Hail Flavius\n",
      "Bought this game and returned it the next day.  What kind of game doesn't start after you install it?  I have a new system and have never had this problem with any other game.  Save yourself some grief and buy something else.\n",
      "I played PnP D&amp;D for years.  If I wanted an exact copy of it on PC, I'd still be ticked off about wasting $50 on this pice of garbage.  I wanted a bit more &quot;pc game&quot; out of this pc game.  This game delivers when it comes to it's adherence to the 3.5 rule set and formulae, but as a video game it is a piece of junk.  D&amp;D fans would be better served by investing in the latest books and playing the traditional way.The graphics are god-awful.  The background environment in the entire game is 2D.  This game may have been on par in 1999 with the then current level of graphic complexity, but it came out at the end of 2002, when Neverwinter Nights had already been on the market for some time.  NWN graphics were and are far superior.  In fact, Baldur's Gate II graphics are/were far superior. I dare say I believe BG ONE had better graphics.Buggy?  This game put a whole new meaning to the term &quot;buggy&quot;.  It crashes.  And it crashes.  And it crashes some more.  Despite the garbage gui, it still slows to a grinding halt even on my up-to-date pc. Even with the patch I have yet to be able to complete this game.Support?  You won't get any from the producers of this crap-fest.  In the words of the head honcho, &quot;...I like to put the [completed games] behind me and move on to the next project...&quot;  I've been keeping track.  A second patch, which is supposed to fix the problems the first patch either missed, or created anew, has been promised for over a year.  Release dates are promised, then the developers just disappear for a time.  No, I don't ever suspect I'll ever be ableto finish this game.Linear.  Probably the most linear RPG created in the past 6 years.  You get no opportunity to explore the world...mainly because it doesn't exist.  Despite the games strict adherance to the D&amp;D 3.5 rules, it doesn't even give you remotely the same experience as TOEE gave when played on PnP.  The side quests are a joke.  They are the worst example of fedex I can think of.  &quot;Go tell him I said OK  I'll wait here.&quot;  &quot;He said OK.&quot; &quot;Tell him I said I like OK, I'll wait here.&quot;  &quot;He said he likes OK.&quot;  &quot;Good.  Tell him to come here.  I'll wait here&quot;  etc, etc, etc.  This is just an example of the hours upon hours of useless &quot;missions&quot; you'll perform.  And you have to perform them as they unlock certain key mission areas.  So in a sense, they aren't side quests at all.  You are STUCK doing them in the exact fashion and order.....linear.  No, you cannot wander off into the woods to explore.If you like D&amp;D...buy the 3.5 rule books and go play the old fashion way.  You'll have a much better time.  If you want a D&amp;D based game for your pc, go get Neverwinter Nights and both expansions.  Besides, theres thousands of mods out there to keep it interesting for years.  NWN has the potential to stay around for as long as Elder Scrolls has.\n",
      "I've read many of the reviews of this game and notice that everyone keeps saying it's \"buggy\".  Well, I wouldn't know about that, as I can't get through the tutorial without getting a massive headache.  Why, you ask?  The font is too small.  I do not know why, but this seems to be a problem that not many reviewers have picked up on.Even in 800 X 600 mode on a 19 inch monitor, you have to sit about one foot away from the screen to read the text clearly. This does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend toward using barely ledgible font in many new PC games.I must defer any other commentary about the game's \"bugginess\" to the other reviewers.  I salute them for being able to play it even for a little while.  Nevertheless, I think that a word of warning should go out to any gamers who don't like the idea of duct-taping their heads to the monitor.\n",
      "before the game even installs, it gives this error something about math64.dll. i have tried EVERYWHERE and EVERYTHING to try to get it to work. from copying the cd's to my hd then installing, to installing the install fix to even install it in the first place. nothing works.\n",
      "Somehow I was able to play this game to the end.  The game had a habit of freezing up on me.  It was pretty cool but the story was weak, however, there's a twist at the end which leaves possibility for a sequel.  After a while I felt like I was just going through the motions of going from one level to the next.  It's good to play only once if the bugs don't get you first.\n",
      "Crap game, doesnt work on xp, vista or windows seven , it wont even allow you to download the game just gives a error message about the memory. apparently this is an ongoing issue which has no support to fix it because the company went belly up.\n",
      "If you're looking for something MTG flavored, you should quite frankly look somewhere else.  This is a poorly-executed attempt at changing a deep strategy game into a fast-paced game of counters and tactics.  It fails.  Miserably so.Tactics in this game roughly amount to whether you send your MTG-equivalent of rock, scissors or paper against your opponent's selection.  There's no more depth to it than that.  To make things even more frustrating, the game requires you mash buttons as quickly and almost indiscriminately as possible in order to match up with the computer's spellcaster.  Thus your choice of rock or scissors is largely decided by luck rather than any true strategy.  And once you figure out what an opposing spellcaster's bag of tricks contains, there's nothing more to beating him than always countering his attack and attacking his weakness- for every opponent you face is a one trick pony.Nothing to see here folks, move along.\n",
      "Worst joystick I have owned. Constantly loses calibration, PIA to re calibrate, the logitech software is a POS. The button assignments will work for a few days then stop. Ended up taking this joystick and throwing it in the trash.\n",

      "I was actually looking forward to playing Terminator 3 on the PS2 and had high expectations for it, just like I had had with the Enter the Matrix game earlier this year.  And once again, just like with Enter the Matrix, I should have known better.  Everything about this game is bad, real bad.  The entire game just seems so poorly pieced together that it comes off as a hack job.  The graphics are bland with chunky polygons, the controls are clunky, the missions are boring and repetitive, and the game all together is too easy.  There are extras to unlock such as CG segments and actual scenes deleted from the film, but nothing here is worth laying down hard earned money for whether it's purchase or a rental.  The mediocre Terminator: Dawn of Fate was better than this dud.  All in all, Terminator fans should stay far away from this game, which is yet another licensed dud.\n",
      "This is the most boring game I have ever played for game cube. The techniques are extremely difficult, for example, if you don't hit a certain button at the right time, its an automatic screw up. The game looks nice though, I'll give it that. The game just feels slow and repetitive. I'm so glad that I rented it and didn't buy it. But this is just my opinion. If you like golf, this might be a great game for you. I think I just disliked this game because I think golf is just boring.\n",
      "mario golf is an awful game.Only 4 secret characters boo,shadow mario,pirrahea piranha,and baby bowser.The game was so limited there was barely anything to do besides for golfing. Stars characters seems pretty damn stupid.The game was very boring and not one bit fun.\n",
      "this was an okay game. not one of the best racing games i played but it was alright. the graphics and scenry was cool though. but i wouldn't buy it.\n",
      "This game was no fun when i flew through it. sure i beat it i patiently went to the end of the game so i have a right to write this review and i still hated the game. I dont mind the story still i dont care graphics are not that great efcets are average i seen better and more of all my pc has trouble running texture of land inside buildings more than 5 aliens my computer goes dead slow. I dont know how i got through last parts with those yellow things. In games like UT2K4 graphics are pretier i never lagg or suffer slow frame rate and i did npot even patch it yet.ON the other hand later i played Xbox version MUCH BETTER so fluid and actiony.I cant think much more of things to say beside i hate this game and those 50$ i spend where not worth it. i should have bought far cry or something. I WILL BURN THIS COPY YOU SHOULD2!!!!!\n",
      "I have heard quite a bit of hype about Halo this and Halo that. So I got it. And much like several other reviewers on this board, I had graphics difficulty from minute one. My system is pretty good, MS XP, 3.06GHz P4, 1 GB RAM, 128MB Radeon 9800. I run Doom 3 at pretty decent levels as well as Call of Duty and other fairly new games. So there just isn't any excuse for the ridiculously slow graphic performance I got. I don't know if the problem is the game's engineering or what, but I am disappointed.\n",
      "I was hearing soooooooooo much of this game from my friends, \"It's the best,\" blah blah blah blah. So I bought it. First of all my system is an Athlon XP 1800+ with nVidia FX 5200 128mb, and 512mb ram, I know it isnt a beast but it can play most games at 1024x768 with medium gfx. Anyway I set this game at what I usually have games set at. And it was studder city. I noticed many other people have had this problem also. So in other words it was very poorly put together. After messing around with the video settings I got it to run decent. Then I felt my efforts were wasted after playing the game. It is SOOOOOOOO HIGHLY OVERRATED. I've played many other better fps's than this. All you really do is wonder aimlessly and blast away everything you see. Thats about it. No varity. And the muti-player REALLY sucks. This game is like many other Microsoft games, Good GFX and Poor Gameplay. I believe the only reason it did any good on Xbox is because it was the only good game for Xbox when it first came out (infact Xbox still barly has any good games ;) I would reccomend call of duty or Medal of honor if you really want a good game.\n",
      "I loved Halo on the Xbox. Truly the first or second best shooter on any platform. &quot;Half Life on the PC is the other contender&quot;. On my Multimedia super killer Dell wide screen notebook with the new Pentium M processor, Nvidia FX 5650 Go Video with 128 mb video RAM and 1 gig of main memory, Halo performance is abysmal.I figured the others who said this may have been a bit over the top. They werent! For Microsoft to have released this piece of drek is irresponsible in the extreme. It is the full Halo game and if you set to the higher resolutions, the scenery is Gorgeous, But, But, But!Unfortunately, even with virtually all the pretty video features turned off and resolution set down to an abysmal 800x600, the massive frame rate (and motion update) slowing (to as bad as less than 1 frame per second) that takes place whenever major scene motion occurs (especially in the middle of gunfights and always during in battle reloading). Make the game practically unplayable. I completed Halo on the Xbox in Normal and Heroic mode. But the PC version in standard mode is going to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update are so bad. Really, Really Bad.There were things that could have been done to fix these issues before release, but lets face it with Halo2 looming, Microsoft had to dump it out here now to have any chance of selling it at all. Half Life works on the PC and has a truly excellent interface. They do use lower resolution figures and scenery, but the whole thing works together. Halo on the PC is on the other end of that spectrum.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS AWFUL! Go out and buy an XBox and get Halo for it. XBox Halo, alone is worth buying an XBox for. The only thing of value in the PC version is the Box it comes in.\n",
      "But releasing it so late for the PC makes it an unworthy competitor to today's top FPS games like UT2003/Unreal 2, America's Army: Operations, the upcoming AA: Special Forces, and other FPS games.Halo multiplayer is also extremely flawed. In Blood Gulch, good banshee pilots will simply start spawn killing and the opposing team won't be able to get a foothold in the battle (CTF).Or worse, you have team killers who also ruin the fun.The banshee and warthog interface isn't what I expected.If they used the Descent engine for the Banshee, and Rallisport Challenge for the Warthog, then it'd be one heck of a game.Overall, it's not worth the money to buy this game since it's already 2 years old. Save your money for something up to date and more fun.\n",
      "This is a horrible game, average graphics, bad controls,and unrealistic. ex. when you sniper someone it leaves a white trail on bullet, i thought snipering was being covert not on this game! overall a bad 1st person shooter.\n",
      "I can honestly say that I loved Halo on the XBOX.  Yes, the levels were repetitive, but the combat was revolutionary!  For those of you that don't know - the XBOX joystick has (among other buttons) 2 thumbsticks (one for each thumb).  Halo was the first FPS for the XBOX - so the Bungie programmers had to decide what these two joysticks controlled.  They chose so well that countless other programmers have copied them, and those that didn't - wish they had!  One thumbstick controls the motion of your character based upon the direction he is looking.  The other joystick controls which direction the character looks.  Did I mention that the Xbox jostick has triggers for both of your index fingers?  Within 10 minutes of playing Halo on the XBOX - I was pretty good.  Within 48 hours - I was one lethal trash-talking Marine!  I have two problems with the PC version.  First, let me prefix this by stating that I am running Halo on a P4 2.4-HyperThreaded/800MHz FSB/512MB/XP Pro/Nvidia GeForceFX 5600 Ultra 128MB.  Suffice it to say that I should be able to play EVERYTHING (expect for DOOM 3) at the highest detail level while having processing power to spare.  Guess what?  When playing Halo for the PC and there are more than 2 aliens on the screen - my system begins to crawl under the strain.  This is in the very beginning - imagine what will happen when I reach THE FLOOD (hundreds of aliens at a time)?  This is unacceptable.  But it is a shame that somebody messed-up Halo PC, because there will be gamers that will never know how awesome the game really is.  My second problem is actually more of a realization.  I now realize that Halo was so revolutionary because of the two-thumbstick/trigger controller.  It is extremely intuitive to control movement with one thumb while looking with the other thumb while firing your weapons with actual triggers.  The keyboard cannot begin to compete.  I read a review on a reputable gaming website that basically stated the exact opposite - he loved Halo on the keyboard.  To each his own - I guess.  Make up your own mind, but I suggest each of you just try it on the Xbox for 10 minutes to see &quot;what all the fuss is about!&quot;\n",
      "Halo is a fun game, no doubt. The graphics are pretty, the gameplay is challenging, and the storyline is fantastic. Everyone knows the single-player game is phenomenal; the single-player game in this PC version is identical to the Xbox version.What this PC version adds to the Halo experience is true online multiplayer. And it's terrible.Oh, the new weapons (flamethrower, fuel rod cannon) and vehicles (Banshee, various Warthogs) are neat. The maps are okay. It's the lame players that drives Halo multiplay into the ground. At the time of this writing multiplayer Halo is filled with dweebs who enjoy nothing more than killing their own teammates while swearing in all caps.This is not fun.Worse, cooperative play through the single-player storyline--easily Halo's best feature--is simply absent. Inexplicably, there is no way to play through the game alongside a pal. Other PC games (Serious Sam, Tom Clancy games) have featured cooperative gameplay. Halo PC supports over a dozen simultaneous players. Halo Xbox had cooperative play. So... why is this feature absent? It makes no sense, and it makes the game much less appealing.Stay away from this game until a patch implements such standard multiplayer controls as Banning, Voting, and auto-kicking for excessive TKs.\n",
      "Alright, I understand companies need to make money, but they should not have put halo on PC.  Should have stayed on xbox where it belongs.  After two years of the game being out, any one who really wanted it would have bought an xbox and played it there.  The graphics are not &quot;souped up for pc&quot;.  They are shakey and choppy because  A) the game was ported, and sloppily.  Plays infinetly smoother on xbox  B) meant to be played with a controller, not a mouse, so it jerks all over the place if you move to quickly.HALO 2 will be on xbox first, and then the same thing will happen: they will put it on PC to earn some quick cash.  That's it.  You want halo?  Buy an xbox.  Blah.\n",
      "_You know...I am an absolute Halo fan...for Xbox anyway.  I played at my friend's house...we had 4 xbox's hooked up, with 4 peeps on each.  I swear...that was the epitomy of all gaming.  It...was almost a religious experiance for me.  I cannot possibly describe how much fun it was._Alas, I do not own an Xbox, nor do I ever plan to own one.  I do not buy an expensive console system for the only game worth playing on it.  So...when the PC version was coming out, I was overly thrilled.  I wanted to be able to play the main game...experiance the storyline I heard so much about...play in large multiplayer games that didn't take months of planning to get 4 xbox's in one house._I read up on it, in magazines and in newspapers.  Reviewers hit it hard for it's graphics and lack of coop main game play.  This didn't phase me.  I could live with that.  I think every game is infinitely better with coop mode and multiplayer, but for Halo, I could do without coop.  I could also live with reduced graphics.  So, I went about getting the game._When it comes out, my computer crashes, so I have to wait.  Finally, I get a BRAND NEW computer.  Halo is one of the first things I get, because I simply can't wait.  I read the min requirements before I buy it...which is absolutely deceiving.First row will be the system requirement for the game, second row will be what I have.733 hmz processer  |  3.2 GHZ1.2 GB hard drive space  |  65 GB free32 MB video card | 128 MB Geforce II128 MB ram  |  512 MB_So I get it and install it on my computer.  Theoretically, this game should fly on it's best settings.  Especially because I see the graphics, and I have larger games with better graphics that run perfectly smooth.  But what happens?  I get into the game, and I think it's paused because I try to move and nothing happens.  12 seconds later, I'm suddenly in a new spot.  Serious, serious lag time._Dissapointed that the game isn't running on highest graphics settings, I decide to put it on lowest, and progress higher until I find a comfortable medium.  Well...the game doesn't even run on minimum settings.  It runs better, but not at any playable speeds.  Clocked at about 1 frame / 5 seconds._I figure there may have been some coding error in the game, so I connect and download a patch from microsoft.  I was almost correct.  The game runs now at 2/frames per second.  So, I'm a lot closer to playable than I used to be, but it's still unplayable.  Wasted money._I try multiplayer, thinking that perhaps it is just the campaign mode that's bad.  But it isn't.  Multiplayer is just as bad, though thankfully not worse.  You'll be happy to know, though, that once you get killed and your carcass is falling to the ground, there is no lag at all!  THAT runs perfectly smoothly.  However, I played a 45 minute game OL, and never got to leave my base.  There were 3 snipers around the base, in an 8 vs 8 game.  And I had a bullet through my head as soon as I respawned.  Lag wouldn't kick in for about 3 seconds, so I tried to run, but alas cheap cowardly idiots had me and 6 others of my team constantly dead...with progressively longer respawn times, of course.  Interesting how I never got to leave my respawn point, or even my base area.  I'm told this is par for Halo, so even the multiplayer I wanted to partake in was flawed.  The servers are chocked full of cheap snipers._Don't get me wrong.  Snipers are fine if you're defending your flag or a strategic point for your team or whatnot.  But...when you kill the enemy within their own base AS they respawn...that's going overboard.  There should be a system where if you snipekill a person within 3 seconds of them respawning, you get killed and have to sit out for 5 minutes.  Because, newsflash, those people are there so they can play, not die where they spawn and watch the clock tick away how long they have until they can rejoin._I know I sound crazy, but the only possible way a smaller game with horrid graphics can run that badly is deliberate sabatoge of the code.  Microsoft, I'm sure, did this to prevent TOO many purchases of the PC version, and help out it's Xbox by keeping it's only good title more afloat.  So, for now I search OL to find someone who's hacked the code and made it playable._I see a man selling bootleg Microsoft software every day on my way to work.  I never respected him for what he does.  The day after I got Halo, I walked up to him, shook his hand, and donated $50 to his cause.  Told him, &quot;Good job&quot;, and caught my bus._This game just isn't worth the web space to trash talk it.\n",
      "I bought the game, based on all the hype about H3 and H2 for Vista.  It was OK, but frankly, HL, a game of the same era was more interesting.  Maybe I am just jaded by the current generation of games such as HL2 EP2 or BioShock.  In any case, OK for an older game, just don't pay much for it at this point in its existance.\n",
      "For the most part I enjoyed this game. I gave it a rating of 1 star to get your attention and to point out that this is only HALF a game. It offers both single player and online multiplay.If you love multiplayer games and have a broadband connection...this game is awesome. WARNING - Most of the Halo Multiplayer servers, groups and games I played were filled with immature 14 year olds that curse 4 letter words at you and accuse you of cheating all the time because they can't shoot straight. I prefer more mature surroundings!If you are looking for a great single player experience...forget it.First of all the graphics are pretty...but dated. Look at UT 2003 on a high end vid card and compare it to Halo. Halo is bland, the levels are redundant. The outside levels are pretty but nothing impressive.Even on the hardest settings this game is way too scripted, the enemy AI is pathetic and predictable. It is not intelligent AI. All the programmers did was setup scripted actions and triggers to generate hoardes and hoardes of enemies to come at you at set intervals as you proceed through a level.Want to beat them easily? Say your in a level exploring...just walk slowly until you trigger some enemies to appear, back track a bit for protection and keep your back to a wall. Kill the enemies as they approach, then step back to where you triggered the enemies, see if you can trigger more and repeat these instructions until you are clear. Proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies. Repeat this strategy throughout the level and the rest of the game.If you get into a heated, heavy battle, just use cover...pop out, shot some aliens and duck again. They almost never pursue you. Only the weird, mutants chase you. Just shotgun them. Nice and simple.There are some tiny little parasite style aliens that are more annoying than dangerous. Don't waste your ammo on them, just let them crash into your shield, let your shield recharge and proceed. PIECE OF CAKE. I walked through this game on the hardest settings, without breaking a sweat, the AI is disappointing. Not horrible, but very PREDICTABLE.Online Multiplay is where this game shines...the weapons are so-so...but having vehicles to drive around is a blast.If you are thinking of buying this title...I would wait. February 3rd, 2004 is the release of Unreal Tournament 2004.************ Unreal Tournament 2004 **********It has vehicles, awesome weapons, a huge online following and BOT AI that will bring you to your knees. I have sampled the beta versions of it and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Con un nuevo set multijugador solo para esta version, Halo para PC se abre paso entre los jugadores amantes no solo de la plataforma si no tambien de su version original para la consola Xbox. Lamentablemente Halo para PC sufrio mucho x ser publicado algunos a&ntilde;os + tarde kel original, topandose con mejores fps tanto en calidad grafica como de trama.\n",
      "Two observations that are outside of the game.  First, do not trust anyone who only writes reviews with 5 star ratings.  These people are either idiots or work for the company.  Second, do not trust anyone who reviews a product before they have seen or played the product all the way through.  Again, such people are either idiots or work for the company.Now, onto, Dark Alliance.  I have played the original Baldur's Gate on the p.c. and have played the first video game version of Baldur's Gate on both the Playstation and the X-box.  All of these games I found very enjoyable and would give them between 3-4 stars.Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance deserves one star.  While the graphics are good, they are not as good as the first game and the makers have an annoying habit of making you fight in the dark to (1) make gameplay more difficult (pretty hard to fight when you can't see) and (2) to mask the fact that the graphics are mostly reused from the first game.Little effort went into originality on this game.  The story is incredibly week.  You play an entirely different character from the first game.  Your character has some secret or mystery that must be completed that differentiates him or her from the other characters.  Once you find out your secret or solve your mystery you will be disappointed because of the anticlimactic reaction of your character and your inability to use the information you gained.Not all monsters (including bosses) give good or any treasures.All monsters are incredibly easy to beat (you only need to press one button over and over again to beat 90% of the monsters) with one exception.  Toward the end of the game you will need to reach the two baddest bad guys.  Right before you meet them you ascend a stair case directly into a room filled with monsters who kill you immediately.  This part of the game was insanely difficult unless you have stealth.Overall, a disappointing game with few, if any, highlights.  Save your money for a worthy game such as Legacy of Cain III.\n",

      "Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe). Since the Deluxe version is available in several forms (which include Rushhour) it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone. I don't normally rate things based on cost, but in this case a downgrade is warranted. This rating is for THIS expansion offerYou may want to check out the CD versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition, the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available on STEAM) and though most MAC users run it on Windows emulators, the Aspyr versionSim City 4 Deluxe (Mac).

      "I've been an avid Medal of Honor Allied Assault fan since the original. I have played every single mission and beat them with flying colors. The original was the greatest. It had everything from sneaking into a German facility, wearing an SS unform, to the invasion of Omaha Beach. MOHAA was original, yet very realistic.Spearhead sort of strayed from this when it had you, an American paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division jump into Normandy and find yourself fighting alongside British soldiers, and then a short time after that in Berlin with the Russians. You had a chance to use the new weapons of these countries, but it seemed too staged to be real.Breakthrough completely broke through my long-time respect for the Medal of Honor legacy. You did the same old thing you did in Spearhead, but in Italy. Realism took a turn for worse as the developers tried to make you feel surrounded. But, what happens is enemy troops will literally appear out of nowhere. Another problem I found was that they NEVER give you enough ammo...And don't say I waste, because I've never ran into this problem before. Also, not to mention the idiotic mission plots and objectives. The third or so mission requires you to liberate a fully-functional and guarded German POW camp in Italy. Not so bad, eh? It requires you to do so ALL BY YOURSELF. And furthermore, by the time I reached it, I had no ammo left. This wasn't any fluke, either. It's happened to me many times in Breakthrough.I think the best advice I can give to you is, &quot;Don't waste your money.&quot; This is not the Medal of Honor you know and love. It is an attempt to prolong the Medal of Honor series that, as you know, is fading away. This is just the same old stuff, folks... Nothing new.\n",
      "I have been a huge fan of Medal of Honor since I bought Allied Assault and even after Spearhead's shortfalls, but this is just terrible.  This expansion pack should have been awesome, yet it failed terribly.  The missions have potential, but are horrible.  The African campaign where you had to defend the braindead minesweeping tanks was sheer agony.  You have to stay ahead of the tanks to protect them, but if you take the time you need to kill the Germans who threaten you and the tanks, you'll likely be run over by the tanks you're protecting.  It's very difficult to keep an eye on your tanks, keep moving up and shooting every German all at once.  After a few minutes, it gets very tiring.In the Italian campaign, you fire one round, ALL the Italians will know exactly where you are and you'll be surrounded in seconds.  Being shot from every angle (where each shot throws off your aim) while using your Garand can be difficult, especially since there will be no health for you until much later.  Later on you will have to fight off hordes of Italian tanks with mortars (as if those mortars could scratch a tank.)  You're in a house with a small wall around it, you have to use these cumbersome mortars to destroy these tanks from two different directions, and if one touches the wall, you fail your mission.  Even if you destroy it a split second after it touches the wall.  Even though the enemy is destroyed, the enemy still has broken through.One very annoying thing is the lack of ammunition.  You have to conserve ammo like mad.  About one in every 10 soldiers drops some ammo, if you're lucky.  In most situations, I had to fight a group of Germans at close range with nothing more than my sniper rifle and pistol (at least the Italian pistol is decent) only to rewarded with no ammunition.  It's very frustrating.The single player mode ended twice as soon as it should have, and I was left with the feeling of \"That's it?\"Like Spearhead, the shortfalls in singleplayer were somewhat made up for with improvements in the multiplayer.  However the improvements were nothing spectacular.  New modes, weapons and maps were nice, when I could play it.  Apparently Breakthrough has a problem where when you try to connect to a multiplayer game, it says your CD key is already in use.  Natrually I thought someone was using a pirated copy with my CD key.  That is, until I went to their website and found out that's not the case at all.  Apparently it's some bug where they screwed up and you have to pay.  The explanation on how to fix the problem is of epic proportions (you have to delete the game in a special way and re-install it in a special way) and I just felt cheated.  They screwed up so you have to compensate to use the product you paid for.This is only everything I feel like writing about right now that I can remember (I gave up on this expansion months ago.)  Just stick with MOHAA or Spearhead if you already have it.  If you really want to try this out, don't spend over $10 for it.EDIT: Since I wrote this review, I re-installed Breakthrough out of curiosity and the multiplayer works fine this time.  I don't know how common the problem I mentioned is.\n",
      "Save your money and do not buy this junk-The stick is poorly designed, and hard to hold..Get a real gaming system\n",
      "Review update  1/23/13So I had the Two Towers game for Gamecube back when it first came out in 2002 and I loved it, and played the ass out of it.  But by the time this one came out, I had either lost interest or couldn't be bothered to spend money on buying it.Where the previous game was smooth, streamlined, and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time.  It had the original voice actors playing themselves, even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording.  It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.Nine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.Everything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.The graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.Adding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;- The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.Some specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.Another horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.- Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.Whereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.This is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.At the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).- Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.This section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of \"an exercise in face-palming stupidity\"The Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like \"Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss\", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.Here, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.Some of the absolute worst examples include:Samwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.The Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.Other times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying \"the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results\".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.Some of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.Similarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of \"I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid\" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.And this \"warm up\" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.And the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!And the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.\n",
      "Dont even rent Mario Kart: Double Dash. It is really boring. All the Mario Karts are the same. Im sick of Mario. He should die already. Dont buy it.\n",
      "This game is not what I had expected.  For one, the graphics suck, and to complete Pokemon Leaf Green/ Fire Red pokedex, you have to beat this game, which isnt an easy takt to be done.  All in all, i dont reccomend this game.\n",
      "I preordered this game and took it back a week after I got it.  The story is contrived and the gameplay is unfriendly.  My friends swore it was better when you played with others, but I found myself just as bored.  I especially didn't like using the Gameboy Advance with it; the GameCube controller is much more comfortable.  On the plus-side, the sound and graphics are decent, but that doesn't make a game, however.\n",
      "My bias is that from a Final Fantasy fan.  Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is NOT a Final Fantasy game.  It doesn't even come close to the Legend of Zelda in terms of action/adventure.  It is a waste of time, space, energy, and money.  All together.I made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my Amazon Wish List when it first came out.  After testing it at stores and reading about it, I quickly realized the game was cheese.  I forgot, however, to remove it from my Wish List.  My brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year!  Aye yie yie!So because of the $50 they scrounged together in my honor, I figured I'd give the game a thorough shot.I couldn't take it anymore by the time I got to the second level.  It was atrocious.  I felt sorry for the Final Fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cash.Enough of the emotional banter.  Let me try to give an analytical review of this game.First of all, it does not meet the definition of a classic role-playing game.  (Within the last couple of years, however, I have noticed \"RPG\" taking on a new meaning.  Now it means simply playing as someone else.  Grand Theft Auto, for example, is now classified as an RPG.)  But with today's loose definition of \"RPG,\" you can call it that, I guess.  But I grew up with real RPGs, like Dragon Warrior, the Final Fantasy titles, Lufia, Breath of Fire, etc.  (These were all turn-based RPGs.)Second, FF:CC does not develop your characters sanely.  Sorry, but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of action/adventure.Third, I recommend you boycott any GameCube title that requires the use of the Game Boy Advance to play multiplayer.  It is asinine to expect people/kids to pay money for such an inconvenient, expensive, and improper method to simply play with your friends.Lastly, this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real RPGs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay.  Yes, FF:CC is an action/adventure, but unlike most others, the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style (it is more hack & slash than anything - the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review, but it was disappointing at best).  But other than that, the game will offer essentially ZERO to true RPG gamers, especially those who love the Final Fantasy series.  Stay away from this game if you love Final Fantasy titles.\n",
      "The game...is too boring for me. YOU DO THE SAME CRAP OVER AND OVER AGAIN!(And I hate repetitiveness! Especially in games.)This was the first final fantasy game I was expecting a grand adventure where I save the world but the only thing my character was worry about is protecting her village from the stupid poisonous misama. And hate that I have to stay in a little bubble so my health doesn't be effected.Here I am beating these monsters up for years (in the game) and there no progress, I'm going in circles because I can't go to the same place twice after I beat it, I have to wait until a couple years pass in the game. I was getting so pissed that I gave up and threw away the game in my closet to collect dust. Then a few years pass and I looked at a video of the game and I found out there's a freakin' final boss! (Which was hard for me to believe since the game doesn't make it obvious or conspicuous that there was one). The fighting gameplay, even a five year old can do it because all you do is press A.\n",
      "This game is LAME!!! It should be called Final Fantasy: the Crystal Losers Chronicles.  all the final fantasy fans, expected a big game, and because Square Enix begins again making games for Nintendo, got all of the Final Fantasy Fans excited.  The game is totally lame, has a serious lack of story!!! Seriously!!!!! You get to pick the name of your town, your character, gender, etc, and then, your on your own, you meet other caravans(but nothing big) and you fight monsters,(SPOILERS)and when you fight the Final Boss, you discover that it's all based on memories,(END OF SPOILERS)and the end is a big piece of crap!The multiplayer version, it's the same, but you can play with your friends, and it's almost impossible to play, cause every player needs a nintendo advance, to play, and to do the spells is very hard!!I just hope that the sequel isn't as lame as this one!!\n",
      "this game is terrible.  well, for one player, anyway.  to be honest, if you don't have at least 3 people, it's not going to be good.if you have one person, that moogle can carry your lamp for you.  if you have 2 people, one the 2 people has to carry that stupid lamp around.  in other words, you have one person fighting, and one person running away from enemies because they have that STUPID LAMP IN THEIR HANDS.so with 3, at least only 1 out of the three has to carry the stupid lamp around.but it doesn't help that the game isn't that fun.  it has very bad play control (it takes your guy like a whole 2 seconds to attack after pressing the button).the graphics are pretty, but not astounding.replay?  hahahaha!  i didn't play it all the way though the first time!  who would?so yeah, get another game instead.  suikoden IV and growlanser generations are out on ps2, and they are way better.\n",
      "I loved the original for the playstation, but this one...Story 2.5/10:  The story is about as deep as a wading pool.  I thought from the start it wouldn't be great but I didn't expect it to be so bland and vapid.  The story opens on a school-yard snowball fight between the munchkins of a small public school, and a clever tutorial instructs you how to play the game throughout the snow fight.  Then three of the loser kids (including the protagonist) go to a house read a book, then wish they weren't losers and were in that fantasy world.  Then while they sleep the world changes and then the main guy ask the other two to help him get the world back to normal but they don't want to because they're not losers there... then you go on a million missions, and the story dies with your motivation to play.Gameplay 5/10:  The battle system is pretty much the same as the first, except you have to learn skills and magic by equipting weapons that have that skill on them.  This wouldn't bother me except that you often have to equip very weak weapons to learn skills you may have missed or haven't gotten to yet.  The battles feel slower then its big brother and they just aren't as fun.Graphics 5/10:  I guess they're good for a GBA game but the first has much better visuals.  The animations and attacks and spells almost put me to sleep, they are very simple and boring.  Overall the graphics just plain lack style or any zest at all.  Oh and the character clothing is outrageously bizzare!!  They look incredible weird even for a FF game, in short I don;t like it.Overall 4/10:  It is, at best, an ok game.  At least it's better than Final Fantasy Chrystal Chronicals  ;(  *shutters*\n",
      "I never thought I'd have to post a bad review of a game in the Final Fantasy franchise, but here goes.I don't know what the game designers were thinking with this. The \"plot\" is virtually non-existant. The game is basically a series of battles. There are no puzzles, nothing in particular to unlock except new battles, and very little sense of progress. There's virtually nil NPC interaction and nothing to figure out. If I wanted a game that was nothing but combat, I wouldn't be playing FF, i'd break out my old copy of the PC dos-based Dungeon Hack (which is exactly what it sounds like).The laws are arbitrary. Restrictions on what kind of combat you're allowed to engage in SHOULD make a game interesting (they at least keep you from overspecializing in, say, warriors or wizards). But when the game arbitrarily and randomly decides \"you can't use weapons in this battle\" or \"you can't use magic in this battle\" with no real rationale, you just start to get annoyed with it. A MUCH better way of preventing over specialization is to throw the player up against a wider variety of monsters so that they MUST have multiple classes to be able to play to all the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.I also really dislike the idea of gaining skills by equiping certain items (instead of, oh, you know, USING the skills in question?). The result is that you end up equipping really weak and generally useless items for longer than you conceivably would in any other game, or you end up lacking very basic skills. Both are artificially limiting.Overall, I think the game just lacks a lot of what makes the Final Fantasy franchise such a popular one, and that's a shame, especially consider how good the original Tactics is supposed to be. This is the first time I've ever NOT finished an FF game that I bought. Not because it was difficult, but because it was mind-numbing.\n",
      "Alot of problembs with this game. The Storyline, battlestyle, movement, charachters, and play is VERY CONFUSING. I Seriously LOVED FFTactics, but this, this is just...no. You don't call this FF and let it go unnoticed. I used to be a dedicated FF fan, they all got booring though. Please, for everyone's sake, don't get hooked on the Final Fantasy series. You just waste your money and time. I suggest *Onimusha, Metal Gear Solid, or the Tenchu series*. They all have very good storylines and ALOT of in-your-face action. Anyways, FFT:A's graphics and music are the ONLY things I liked about it. Otherwise, I just plain disliked it.\n",
      "This game sucked, basically hold a and prey, it was dumb played for 30 seconds and had to shut it off why did I waste my $???\n",
      "I hated this game. I mean, it's just pinball, (my least favorite arcade game,) if you don't like pin ball even a little bit...this game is really not for you.\n",
      "I've already reviewed \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the \"Super Mario All-Stars\" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the \"Super Mario Allstars\" version).  We all know \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of \"Super Mario All-stars\".\"SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing\"To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.Now, let's get to the problems of \"Super Mario Advance 4\", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, \"World-e\".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card readerSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" style of \"Super Mario Bros.\".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to \"Super Mario World\" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in \"Super Mario 3D Land\", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, \"Slidin' the Slopes\", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the \"New Super Mario Bros.\" series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, \"Super Mario Advance 4\" would be the definitive port of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!

      "what was CAPCOM thinking when they tried to make a mega man x game 3d??? the thing i ALWAYS liked about the mega man x series, was it ALWAYS kept the &quot;traditional&quot; side scrolling theme! i always liked that, they were the only ones who knew it was about game play and not 3d graphics. i put the emphasiz on &quot;were&quot;! this is horrible, i cant believe they made it into 3d graphics. not only is it not as appealing!, but it ALSO makes it hard to see enemies that are coming your way. thats what i LOVED about mega man x6, it was still the traditional REAL side scroller. i cant believe they broke this &quot;tradition!&quot;\n",
      "this is the worst 3d megaman game I've ever played. the camera angles suck. It is very difficult to see things. The control sucked as well. I regret buying this game.\n",
      "I know they called the game Mega Man X, but they put too much emphasis on X.  Those special weapons that you acquire get wasted quick and are not effective when they are the boss' weakness.  I love the armors that X has throughout the series, but I have to say, the armor in this game looks like the one from the first one with minor changes for looks and the abilities suck.  Zero and Axl can go through the levels, but going through the bosses are going to make you pull your hair out if you have any.  Then the voice acting is horrible that you wish you didn't play the game.  Overall, if you're a fan, it's going to make you go WTF.  Capcom got lazy and didn't think about their loyal fans.\n",
      "An onion being a maverick?  what happened to the boss selection screens we used to see where there were bosses we were scared to face first because they looked bad?  None of these bosses looked threatening and the weakest looking are actually the hardest...(the kangaroo boss.)  Capcom should've kept it 2D and axel has no purpose.  The ability to switch between characters takes away from the challenge and megaman sounds like doug funnie.  Avoid!\n",
      "just stop with these games, they've sucked forever, this one is just too hard and cheesy. die mega man or x or zero or whatever the main character is now.\n",
      "ever since i was about 5 years old, megaman has been my favorite videogame. I started wih megaman 7 and was instantly hooked! As the series went on it was nearing its peek. meg man X was insanely good, great powerups, and o so much mroe to collect, as was X2, and especially the ultra rare, 125 dollar X3. The trnslation to the next gen consoles is usually the ultimate down fall of great side scrolling, old school shooter, and this is no exception. Megaman had some undoubtedly rough spots, what with megaman legends, and megaman 64, things were really looking down. Then capcom graced us with megaman X4, good ol' side scrolling fun, and megaman was good again for a brief shining moment. Then again the quality began to slip with X5 and 6, and X7 is definately the low point.the problem with this game is that megaman was never meant to be a 3D expierience, it just doesnt work. The game has terrible controls, average graphics, and infuriates you past the point of caring anymore. Megaman should frusterate you, but before it fueled you to do better, now it just pisses you off and causes a lot of broken controllers. The megaman anniversery edition just came out, and is an excellent old school finger numbing smash! It features behind the scenes videos, sketches, and even the original TV commercials for megaman 1 through 8, which are available for play, plus 2 Japan only boss rush modes, try that instead, you won't regret it!\n",
      "Where to begin on this review of one of my top 5 worst Mega Man Games of all time. Okay, for those who know nothing about the series, it's a sub series in the Mega Man franchise. The sub-series began on the Super Nintendo (or Super Famicom in Japan) which is considered not only one of the best Mega Man games of all time but also one of the best games on the system. 2 more came out (along with Mega Man 7 and Mega Man Soccer, which is not part of the X series) and then eventually went on to the 32 bit era (Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn, as Capcom didn't care for Nintendo's N64 console) and released X4. The graphics were redone but were still in 2D and along with that were cinemas and voice acting. Of course we can forget about voice acting as it was still very bad. Later, in 2001, X5 came out and the gameplay was the same but a few different things were added. X6 came out a year later and this was the final X game to come out for the PSone (Sega's Saturn had only X4 due to being a failure). People were displeased with X5 and X6 due to \"unupdated\" gameplay and difficulty level. Then This... This game came out. When I first played it I was excited to play a new X game because the X games were actually my favorite games of all time. I played through this disaster and my heart was shattered into a million tiny pieces. First of all, you can't play as X... hold on a second, you can't play as X! I later found out why Capcom did this and it was because it was part of the story as X didn't want to fight anymore so you play as Zero and AXL (Why did they make this character? he sucks!). The gameplay was way too weird for my tastes and the boss battles were just terrible. Go on YouTube and look up the gameplay and boss battles for more info. I only played this game once but playing it just once told me to never ever play this disgrace again. Hear Me Out: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!\n",
      "I can't give this game much credit, with the exception of the audio.  The game is very short.  Six hours on an FPS is laughable.  Half of that prblem is the AI.  I don't know about you, but when I need to reload I try to take cover.  Instead &quot;they&quot; go to an open area, stop, then start reloading.  That isn't AI at all.  The walking fungus in Mario was smarter.The weapon selection is a bit on the short side.  I know it took place in WWII.  I also know there was more than FIVE guns (a fire extinguisher doesn't count).  Yeah, I can mount guns.  They look a little different, but feel the same.  Sorry.I might be too critical of this game because of anticipation, or maybe the game was over-hyped.  I gave it a chance, and I was let down.P.S. There is always XIII\n",
      "The Medal of Honor series has been popular for a long time.  After all, who doesn't like playing the same event (World War 2) 25 times?Anyway though, \"Rising Sun\" is an example of how a company can get away with making trash, and still have it get decent reviews, and have it sell well.  \"Rising Sun\" is a horrid game, and is considered a letdown even to most Medal of Honor fans.\"Rising Sun\" does absolutely nothing new, with a series that had already been around for years, upon years.  At the point of \"Rising Sun\" Medal of Honor was already considered an established series for Sony.Anyway, when it comes down to it, Medal of Honor's \"Rising Sun\" game is a disappointment on all levels.  The gameplay is linear, and is often totally ridiculous, and the story is well.....nothing new either.Only pick up \"Rising Sun\" if you want yet another horrid first person shooter, with nothing special in it.\n",
      "This game is awful. Very bad graphics by a first person shooter. Ugly, bland enviroments with bad atmosphere. Seems they went bachward from the first one. They now added a multiplayer mode witch is essential to a good FPS, tobady is sucks. I never understood what was going on and it is easy to get lost in the jugle witch all looks the same to me.

I will not even bother commenting on the game play cuz I think most of the guys here did a great job of describing it. Just do yourself a favour and let that god-forsaken game collect dust on the shelf. The creators of this game should be ashamed of themselves!!\n",
      "Medal of Honor: Rising Sun was a huge disappointment. First of all, the graphics are horrible for a fps of its time. The graphics are actually worse than Frontline's! Not only do the graphics suck, but so does the AI and the gameplay.The game was extremely linear. You are confined to only one direct approach for every mission: Run down the only (and most obvious) path and frag every mentally-challenged Jap in your way.(Think of this game as playing the first Mario Bros. except Mario is replaced by a GI with a gun. And goombas are Japs.) This game is for single-minded people who enjoy playing games which have no depth whatsoever.The AI of this game is horrible. For example, one time I left Gunny behind, and he crossed paths with a Japanese soldier while trying to catch up with me. The Japanese soldier stabbed him with a bayonet about 50 times, but Gunny didn't care because he was so intent on getting to where I was. He just kept trying to run throught the Jap while he was getting stabbed.(Gunny never died either)Another thing that irkes me is that EA made every single enemy have the same death animation. The guy that you clubbed with your pistol dies in the exact same fashion as the guy who recieved a direct hit from a bazooka or hand grenade.I could go on an on about how bad this game is, but that would take a year at least. First person shooters are getting quite advanced these days, and Rising Sun just does not live up to the standards of other fps' like Halo or even the first half-life.To sum it up, Rising Sun is a low budget, linear, boring game with no replay value. I feel bad for my uncle for going out and spending his time and money to get me this game for Christmas.  Any person with an IQ of 5 could beat this game within a day.\n",
      "week upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping  to get the new MOH and onee day it's there so i put it in the ps2 and it's kind of like the terminator... kill kill sometimes have a hard mission, the AI sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the HARD difficulty level the extremely anti-climactic ending. WAY to easy i beat it in 1 day and took it back, no re-playability. back to its to easy, way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a 8 year oild could beat this game..take my advice dont even rent this game,find a friend who has it and borrow it, i dont think they'll care it's so bad\n",
      "I bought this when it was first released for the PS2.  I had high expectations due to its predecessor, Medal of Honor Frontline.  This game was a huge disappointment to say the least.  You start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese attack, and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape.  So, the beginning of this game is not too bad, and I was mildly interested in the gameplay.  Then things went downhill.  I can sum it up with one sentence:  Before I knew what was happening, I was done with the game.  Yes, that is right:  this game is so short it is not even worth the $ price tag.  I beat it in about 7 hours, and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating meals.Summary (out of 10)Graphics: 5Controls: 5Story:  3Gameplay: 2Overall:  3If you want a good military shooter, try Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor Frontline.  Medal of Honor Rising Sun is not worth the time it takes to get the shrinkwrap off.\n",
      "This game is terribly pure and simple.  First, the graphics are poor, the players looked distorted, with overally large heads and feet.  Second, the game play and controls are poor, with the game handling nothing like real college basketball, and poor button placements.  Finally, reality?  They can't even get stadiums correct on the inside.  They don't look anything like what they are supposed to be.  Save your money, if you really want a good college basketball game, get ESPN College Hoops, you won't be dissappointed.\n",
      "i hate this game! it drives me nuts. i bought the first 2 bond games and i was very surprised with all the gadgets and the good graphics. but now, they changed over to third person. this is the worst thing they could ever do! i hate this game! the multiplayer has something messed up with it, and the lock on target thing sucks. cuz u could be like a mile away and ur gun could just automatically lock on to the player. it's very unrealistic. SO NEVER BUY THIS GAME it is horrible.\n",
      "my god, it's amazing how overrated some games can be.supposedly the \"best\" bond game.. and i love bond, i love FPS action games, surely i would love this game, right?!  wrong.things start off looking fun... oh, a nice little tutorial to teach you cool moves.  cool weapons.  but things immediately reveal themselves to be terrible.  you repel down a wall..  then you have about 6 guys shooting at you from all sides.  but uh oh, their bullets are apparently much stronger than yours!  and there's no health to be found anywhere!  wait, you're telling me bond packed all these incredible technological tools in his backpack, AND HE DOESN'T BRING ANY MED KITS??? jesus christ, you must be joking.  that wouldn't be a problem if surviving wasn't nearly IMPOSSIBLE.  and remember, this is just the FIRST part.  you have more parts to complete after this, while TRYING to stay alive.ok, so let's say you're a wonderful gamer and you DO survive.  so what?  the shooting action is BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING.  press a button to auto aim your enemy.  pull the trigger.  that's it!  no aiming at all!  just pushing a button.  wow.  this is what games have become?  give me a break.  i've played great FPS games on PC like call of duty and half-life 2, and this doesn't cut it, at all.  besides, who decided that bond is supposed to be some superman with a pistol anyway??  isn't he supposed to be more of a spy than rambo?\n",
      "I know for a fact that I check pc when I went on amazon to track my purchase there I see that the game is a playstation no Pc\n",
      "i haven't played this game but i know from experience (i have 2003) that this probably sucks.  let me take a guess and say that yao ming and lebron james aren't even in the game.  as far as the dynasty mode goes, you realize that the averages per 48 minutes are completly out of whack, such as when i played tyson chandler for 40 minutes a game and he still had only 6.0 rebounds a game when simulating(the same average for when he played 19 minutes a game).  he should be averaging at least 10.5.  the rookies provide stats that are less than encouraging, nen had 9 points and 5 boards per game in 38 minutes!!!  also, where are the foreign players to be found in the rookie draft (they make up practically half of the first round). for the gameplay, the only exciting teams would be sacramento and dallas, yet the knicks offensive scheme is strictly run-and-gun.\n",
      "this game sucks!!!!!!!! u can not score at all!!!! if u try to go inside alls u get is a charge or a miss besides the new dunk button sucks u can never dunk it even if your 2 inchins away from the basket!!!!! wat im trying to say is  GET ESPN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I was scratching my head last year why EA changed the sprint control from the triangle to the R1, and then I played Winning Eleven 6, and it hit me. Electronic Arts have been playing catch up since Konami came out with the Pro-Evolution/Winning Eleven series.  What amazes me is that there are still people giving good reviews to the Fifa series? Just a word of advice, pick up a baseball bat and stop kidding yourselves. What's wrong with 2004 you ask? Everything! This is not futbol, futebol, soccer, calcio or anything remotely near it. I learned my lesson after buying Fifa 2003 without even playing it first. This year I rented 2004 and I returned it the same day. The Fifa series is a bad cancer for futbol. It alters the perception of the public of what the game is truly about just so it can be marketable in the US. Just like when FIFA tried to incorporate the timeout just so they can fit in those 3 minute commercial spots. Can you even imagine they experimented with it in Brazil? Well I'm through experimenting with the Fifa series form EA. I just hope somebody from EA reads this review and comments it on their next creative meeting. 'Where did we go wrong?' they would ask themselves. Simple, you never listened to your customers.\n",
      "What they produce it's not soccer!!!, I bought fifa 2004 just for the online play, (another disappointment the online gameplay) but just like others fifa's games, a complete dissapoint. It's seems like your game it's a merge of soccer and NFL, NOT soccer at all. Everyone who played real soccer... at least once in it's life, could tell you that fifa series it's not soccer, or it's what EA team think soccer it's.. or should be, but not way of play. Fifa have good grafics, but you don't feel the emotion of the soccer seen graphics, soccer it's passion, not graphics and tactics of NFL games. I won't purchase any fifa game ever!. See what Winning eleven 6 or 7 does, or Word tour soccer 2005 does whith the gameplay.\n",
      "Being a huge fan of XSN Golf for Xbox, I decided to try Tiger Woods' game because of all the rave reviews I've heard.  I was so disappointed.  The controls are rather difficult and hard to master.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 is not that much different from last year's Tiger. The analog swing is unchanged, letting you control the power and direction of your shot with a back-and-forward motion on the analog stick.One of the big new additions to Tiger Woods 2004 is the &quot;game face&quot; feature that allows you to create your own pro golfer with a rather painstaking level of detail. This player creation mode lets you define virtually every aspect of your player's appearance. For some idea as to how extensive it is, there are 18 different attributes that can be modified in terms of facial structure alone, not including facial hair, eye color, skin tone, and what your golfer's teeth might look like. Truly, the level of character customization offered by the game face feature is unparalleled.The only nagging issue with the Tiger Woods games that EA has yet to address seriously is the game's soundtrack. For the past two years, EA has been assembling seemingly random collections of contemporary licensed songs and calling them soundtracks.\n",
      "Obviously released prematurely for Xmas, this game has more bugs and glitches than any game I've ever even heard of.  The patch does nothing to fix any problems and when asked, the developers on the eidos website give answers that are borderline rude.  A definite slap in the face to all gamers.  It breaks my heart to think about how many kids unwrapped this Xmas morning to find that their game doesn't work because the eidos quarterly report might have suffered had they put a few more weeks into this pseudo software.\n",
      "As a story-teller I was eager to play this game for the wide possinilities of scenarios.  As a game I was very disappointed.  First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions.  Only in game play was I able to move my character.  Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt.  If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo.  That was just a waste of space.  I also felt limited by the small selection of tools.  Not even the cheat codes would entirely work.  For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips.  The guns themselves were not even very good.  The sniper rifle didn't \"snipe.\" The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak.  I should have bought Halo when I had the chance.\n",
      "If you think you've got a nice, relatively new computer, therefore you should be able to play Deus Ex. Be careful and read the video card support list very carefully. I have a Dell Dimension 2.4 gHz machine with a Geforce 4MX video card. Deus Ex will not play on this video card. Your card must have Pixel shader 1.1 capability to run. I bought the game and it will not work on my machine. I fell into this trap because I didn't know what the exact video card in my machine was. I assumed that, because it was relatively new and not bottom of the line, it would run pretty much any game out there. Live and learn. Don't make the same mistake as I did.I'm rather discusted with the deus ex creators. I've been eagerly waiting for this game and now I can't play it. They didn't even give me the option of defeating pixel shading. So what if it wouldn't look as nice, at least I would be able to play it.Oh well, The reviews I have read say it was a real disappointment anyway. I'm just glad I didn't run out and buy it for $50 when it was first released. I only got stuck for $20.I guess this game will sit on my shelf until I upgrade my system in a few years. Hopefully it will be compatable with the system I buy then.\n",
      "The graphics in this game aren't all that much of an improvement, but the game is incredibly choppy. Did Eidos use the UT2003 enging? I doubt it. I'm saving up to buy the GeForce FX 5700 Ultra, so Deus Ex 2 had better not be choppy at all. I've got a fast pc with a gig of PC3200 ram, so when I buy and install the 5700 Ultra, I'd better see 30 fps or more, or there is something seriously wrong with this game's engine.\n",
      "I really liked the first Deus Ex game, and so it hurts me to have this say this, but Deus Ex invisible war is one of the worst games I've played and one of the biggest computer game disapointments ever. It almost seems that the designers intentionally removed all of the good stuff from the first game.First, there is the way the game looks. I am not talking here about performance issues. I have a new computer with a 9800xt graphics card and 1 GB ram, and the game runs smoothly on my machine. The problem is that it just does not look very good. When you consider some of the amazing graphics that have been done in computer games in the last couple of years (Splinter Cell, for example, or even in budget titles like Devastation) it is hard for me to understand why this game looks so bad. Maybe part of it is the the artwork and design; the character animations look like weird cartoon figures. Also, the game areas are too small. Forget about the big, sprawling environments in DX. Here you will be constantly waiting for the next little area to load.Forget about the much-hyped physics; dead bodies flop around in a ridiculous way, and bumping into objects sends them spinning through space like Babe Ruth hitting one out of the park.The skill system, which made DX (and its predecessor System Shock) so awesome are gone. Why? The ability to customize your character and evolve through the course of the game was one of the most satisfying parts. You've probably already heard about the Universal Ammo thing, another serious design mistake IMO. The game is also quite short, and seems much shorter than the original. Also, without the various skill paths through the game, there is little replayability.Basically this is a textbook case of how to ruin a game sequel.\n",
      "This is a warning to people who have not bought this game!It does not support any of the nVidia MX vidio cards.\n",
      "This game is terrible in every way possible.  The graphics actually take a step backward from the first Deus Ex.  The RPG element that was so great in the first game was hacked into pieces for this game, making it nearly unplayable.  The plot is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered.  The maps are small, which means very little exploring.Overall, this game is not worth the box it comes in.  I am very disappointed that Eidos would slap together a game like this and unleash it on the public.  Shame on you Eidos.  We know you are capable of so much more!Deus Ex Invisible War = Terrible = Buy Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition.\n",
      "This game was made for the console only, all the great things about the first one have been taken out, from the skill sets, ammo, reloading, the inventory. Everything has been super simplified so now its a FPS not an action rpg. ALso your looking about around 15 hours of gameplay. The most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name. FOrgot to mention a very weak AI and no head shots or body specific damage like the first one. They should of named it DIET Deus Ex\n",
      "I bought this game like day or or 2 after the fay it came out and i was all exited when i was installing it had this little game of some sort to entertain you will it installs the 4 discs but when i was done installing it it said \"Failed to find DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics adapters in this system! Please make sure you have DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest drivers by the manufacturer.

      "138$ for this lame, boring, annoying game??? I hope no one is dumb enough to pay that price.  The Sims 2 is just as boring, stupid, pointless and annoying as the first one.  Lets simulate going to work, raising a family, eating, using the bathroom wow what a game.  I play games to get away from reality for a few hours not to simulate it.....my god go and cook your dinner, pay your bills, go to work and have some kids....you just played sims.  LAME!!!\n",
      "This game does not work despite the patches and tech support.  It will always crash at random times during game play.  Also, if you do get it to work, it is so slow that you decide that you don't really want to play anymore.  I'd give it a higher rating if it actually worked.\n",
      "I am going to keep it simple, I am crying right now.This game is too short. DO NOT WASTE you 50$It took me and my roommate 3 hrs to beat.:( my money WASTED\n",
      "Im sorry for saying this but this game is not worth a second look.me and my father love the MOH series, but we beat it in 3 hours. It is very unchallenging and a waist of money. Now that you can buy this game for 5 dollars i think its worth it. if your spending anything over 15 dollars dont consider buying this game. A complete putdown to moh lover.the graphics are no good and its bugged. it takes 5 sniper rounds to kill 1 enemy, rediculous. also u can shoot the enemy in the head and he will flinch, :Pi know cause Im acually done beating it.i dont recommend this game to any1.\n",
      "This game would take about about an hour to play if the controls and weapons were at all responsive. Some of the environments look pretty, put the enemy fighters are straight out of a windows 95 first person shooter.People complain about suppossed racism in the GTA series, but our group of racially mixed gamers found the asian enemies in Rising Sun to be offensive stereotypes beyond anything in Vice City. Unlike Vice City, which is violent with an obvious tongue in cheek sarcasm, this game wraps it's racial violence with themes of patriotism, making Rising Sun truly disturbing.\n",
      "James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is one of the worst games I ever played. The third person is really annoying because you lock on to the targets you dont want to. Some of the missions are pointless like the one where you jump off a building and you have to dodge things while you fall. You cant even shoot anything in that mission. Dont buy this game.\n",
      "Is it just me, or is that the 007 games have just been getting worse and worse since Goldeneye?  In fact, with the latest addition to the Bond franchise, \"Everything or Nothing\", you could actually say that \"Everything\" about it is \"Nothing\".  This game is just plain dumb.  I thought when I just had herd about this game \"oh great!  a third-person Bond game\".  I was highly mistaken.  This game has terrible gameplay, terrible controls, and terrible cutscenes.  Bond fans, gamers or not, will be highly dissappointed with this game, because it has NOTHING compared to Agent Under Fire, and Goldeneye.  This game's predecessor, Nightfire, sucked equilly as much, and if they make another Bond game after this, it will flop so badly that the entire franchise will go out the window.  People tell me that it's \"my opinion\", but theyr're wrong.  This is THE opinion.  This game is a waste of time and money.  DO NOT BUY IT!\n",
      "This is the worst bond game ever, and possibly the worst game ever. It is not a game, it's a movie. here are the reasons it sucks:1)EA went with the trend and went 3rd person. This disallows for any entertaining gameplay at all, because you cannot sidestep.2)The co-operative multiplayer is a completely different story than the single player, and all of the characters you start with are generic ppl.3)The Co-operative mode is unbelievably hard. It is like trying to shove a rhino in a soda can. It is not entertaining, and is the most frustrating thing i've ever played.4)You must beat the first \"level\", which consists of about 10 cansecutive levels, of co-operative to unlock arena mode.5)I have repeatedly completed every goal to get a platinum medal on one mission, but the game refuses to award it to me.6)The only good things about this game are the driving levels, but they soon become repetitive and boring.7)Pierce Brosnan's scrip is worse than that of Dyanasty Warriors 3. After having a discussion with Q about metal, Q suggests he leave. Bond says \"Platinum idea, Q, lets test Diavolo's mettle.\"The line \"Bond, James Bond\" is repeated at least 4 times, and it is not dilivered well.8)I know it's a little sexist, but the girls are ugly as hell.9)The game is basically a remixed, retextured Enter the Matrix, only with worse hand-to-hand combat, and no focus ability.10)The only reasons to play this game are to see John Cleese as Q, and Willem Dafoe as Diavolo (2 letters away from the spanish word for devil)\n",

      "Spawn Armageddon is hack and slash game played in the third person perspective. Similar to \"Devil May Cry\", you use combo moves and slash at demonic creatures with your sword/shield. You can also collect and purchase weapons like guns and magic spells. When you kill demonic creatures you can collect their souls and add to your magic or energy level. The main problem with this game are the bland level designs, repetitious action and bad camera angles.Pros:+good attack combos+lots of abilities+good controlsCons:-boring level design-bad camera angles-cheap graphics-repetative-weak sound fx-junk heavy metal music-game has a generic feelThis game is not worth buying because it just looks and feels so cheap and generic.\n",
      "I really like Corvettes, because not only is it cool that Chevy, the typically cheapest part of GM, makes the best sports car, but their value-driven performance, low repair costs, and respectable fuel economy make them a great buy.  And, of course, the Corvette is an American icon.So when I saw this game, I was excited.  Fifty years of Corvettes?  Sweet!I was so wrong.Yes, this game contains 50 years of Corvettes.  That's about all it delivered.  If you can deal with the laggy framerate and middlin' graphics, you'll notice that the cars in the game have about a 2 second delay in responding to your controller inputs, and when they do respond, they do so in a floaty and generic manner that is the same for almost all the cars in the game, regardless of generation or year.Add some decent tracks that don't particularly add much to the game, the fact that there is no car damage, no police chases to speak of (which most arcade-style driving games have), and some completely irrelevant \"upgrades,\" and you've got a recipe for a really lousy game whose \"fun\" level is on par with oral surgery.Don't waste your money with this shameful attempt to cash in on the Corvette name.  Buy a decent racing simulator (Gran Turismo) or arcade game (NFS) that at least contains a few Corvettes and doesn't utterly suck.\n",
      "This game is truly awful. It is, without a doubt, the WORST racing game I have ever played. Racing games I played on my old Sega Genesis were better than this boring, stupid game. The cars look ok, but they're not half as good as the ones in &quot;GRAN TURISMO 3&quot;. They're just not fun to race. You can only race certain cars on certain tracks and that just plain STINKS! Even the opening movie is BORING. Two vettes endlessly racing down the highway for what seems an eternity.Take my advice and stay clear of this game. There are better racing titles out there like &quot;BURNOUT&quot;, &quot;NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND&quot;, &quot;MIDNIGHT CLUB 2&quot;, &quot;GRAN TURISMO 3&quot; and even &quot;FORD RACING 2&quot;. Try one of them but forget this game. It is TERRIBLE! -George Bauch.\n",
      "I'd like to give this game a good review, but unless you read the fine print, you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn't work on LCD televisions.  It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets.\n",
      "Spawn: Armageddon's storyline goes like this: A group of renegade angels have launched a massive weapon straight into the depths of hell in an attempt to destroy it. Unfortunately, the side effect of this weapon strike is that hell's minions now have an easy exit to the earth's surface. In addition to that is an escaped experimental supersoldier, developed by Spawn's primary earthly adversary, Jason Wynn.Now that you know what the game is about, you can know how bad it is.First off, you have an extremely lackluster fighting system.  Press punch once and you'll swing Spawn's axe.  Press it twice, and it does a different one swing attack.  Press it three times and you get 1 combo.  So basically it goes (1) uppercut slash, (2) a forward flip attack, and (3) a jumping axe slam attack. How exciting is that?  There's also a one swoop jump attack, but you will only need this in special cases and even then it becomes repetative.Second, the guns are pretty useless, when it comes down to it.  I'm curious why no one in the production team thought to ask why have guns, if you can't find enough ammo to use them adequately?If the game has any saving grace, I would have to say it lies in both your chain attacks and the special moves as they are fairly interesting.  The chain attacks are by far the best thing this game has going for it.  You can either use them to simply pummel your foes back to the underworld or you can send them there in pieces, literally splitting them to the four winds!The special moves are called &quot;Hell Attacks&quot; and there is a meter to regulate how much you can abuse it, because let's face it, you will.  Most of them are various projectile attacks, but the most useful ones would be the time-dilation effect and the furies from hell.The time-dialtion basically gives you the ability to move faster than everyone else, or slow everyone down, depending on how you look at it.As for the furies, Spawn has the ability to summon a group of spirits from hell to attack an intented victim.  A very satisfying move indeed.The absolute worst part of this game are the jump puzzles.  Who puts jump puzzles in a superhero game?  It defies all reason.  You will need to use your cape and chain power to pull off these ridiculous yet necessary excersizes.Don't expect good music either.  This game has the most dreariest hum tones I've ever heard.  There's simply no life to it.Finally, if you want a repetative poor excuse for a superhero game, or are just a die-hard Spawn fan, then this is the game for you.\n",

      "Any DBZ product is bound to get a lot of attention. I could place a DBZ sticker on a pile of crap(literally) and sell it for 50 bucks. The DBZ audience is primarily younger kids though so they are bound to review this game with 5 stars no matter what.The graphics are choppy. Characters leave fuzzy trails which will hurt your eyes. Every character has the same moves. Of course everyone will give this game 50000 stars because their favorite character is in it. The problem though is that all the characters are the same. It is unrealistic when Brolly can't take down Cell. As for the fighting... It is all the same. They have special moves but they take 50308952805028 hours to pull off. It hurts my hands. On top of that... basically I could memorize the dictionary before I memorize Goku's Kamehameha.Of course, the game will get 4.5 stars. It's DBZ so it is bound to get top scores from 9 year olds. The truth is that this game is bad. It is a terrible game and a waste of money. Don't let these 9 year olds tell you differently because the game contains their favorite character. It is bad.\n",
      "With the exception of Budokai, Dragon Ball Z games often fare poorly. DBZ: Taiketsu, sadly, joins their dismal ranks. If nothing else, Taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show. The large characters look clear and visible on the tiny GBA screen, but overall they can't compete with the superior graphics of GBA champions MK:DA and Street Fighter, and Taiketsu's herky-jerky animation is also particularly distracting. To save battery juice, go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effects-since the game lacks character voices, you won't miss anything important. Taiketsu's button-mashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic, even for a kid's fighting title. There are 15 characters total, including favorites from both the series (like Cell and Goku) and the movies (including the popular Brolly). Aside from the occasional super-move, each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos. Worse, there's very little difference between the various fighters. Players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat, but that gimmick burns out quickly. On the plus side, the game thoughtfully includes several play modes (like Tournament and Endurance) to help extend the replay value; unfortunately, none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable. Another nice touch is the Soul Calibur-esque secret system, which allows players to earn Z Points to unlock bonus modes, settings, and pictures. Overall, unless you're an eight-year-old DBZ fanatic, you'll find that this Saiyan is hardly super.\n",
      "when i first saw dis game i thought it would be cool but this game sucks.graphics are terrible, fighting styles,very lame, and weapons dissapear after u strike ur apponent with it(if i hit an enemy with a bat,i sure as hell wouldn't want it to dissapear....)\n",
      "I know some people love it, but I really don't.First off, any game with 9,999 levels has got to be some kind of joke.  How can such a thing be possible without becoming a mind-numbing, repetitive grind?  Answer: it cannot.Not that you have to get that high, but my point is, if you think that many levels is some kind of good thing, you and I have nothing in common, and you might as well stop reading right now.This is actually one of the very few games I've ever traded in.  I just couldn't see myself ever inserting the disc again after the first few days.  The gameplay is silly, the story is silly, the voice acting is ... well, it's actually decent.  But I don't buy games for the voice acting alone.The \"innovative\" lift-and-throw feature is interesting the first couple of times, but once you learn how to exploit it all the time, it becomes more of a chore, like something you're being forced to do instead of something fun.  Same with the ludicrous geo-color-nonsense.  Yes, you CAN kill everything on the screen with it, but how is that engaging or immersive?  To me, it just makes everything ridiculously simple, and it gets old fast.And the bit about leveling up items?  Ugh.  Seriously, I cannot be bothered.  Not fun.If you like RPGs that have a good story punctuated with truly strategic battles that actually make you think, if you are looking for a challenge and accept that you might actually lose a tough battle, or if you care at all about rules that make some kind of realistic sense, do NOT buy this game.If, on the other hand, you like to powerlevel your dudes and easily pwn everything on the map in every fight with the same repetitive set of strategies, and if you think unsubtle sexual innuendo and jokes about bodily functions are the height of humor, this game is totally for you.\n",

The game should have fast gameplay to get right off the ground.It as a mistake to make this game. I think now Virtua Fighter 5 will be even worse because Sega may be running out of ideas. With everything Sega used to make this game, they should have saved for Virtua Fighter 5.\n",
      "graphics are above average, but this game didn't grab my attention like gilty gear X2. It seems so normal and the fighting is just awful compared to gilty gear X2. get that instead. I hate fighting games with no weapons and this is no different. After playing it, I wondered why it got such great reviews. It just bad. the fighting seams robotic and slow.\n",
      "You play as a voodoo doll, named &quot;Voodoo Vince&quot;, your mission is to rescue the vodoo priestess who got kidnapped (she is your owner). As a voodoo doll, you have power to inflict injury to your enemies by first causing injury to yourself (of course). you can perform special voodoo attacks when you collect enough magic orbs (from defeated enemies). It's just a standard platformer game once you get past the novelty. You can do your basic spin attack, jumps, grabbing onto ledges and floating. The graphics are nice and have a deformed look to it, adding to the wacky atmosphere of the game. The sound effects and music, were good, but very repetative. The controls were okay. The game gets difficult fast, and will give younger players a hard time. Since younger players are the target audience I think it was a mistake to make the game this hard. The game is also very short and very linear.Pros:+good graphics+good controls+voodoo doll powers+funnyCons:-very difficult gameplay-weak sound effects-repetative music-very short game-linear gameplay-difficult puzzles-nothing innovating-dark looking levels-awkward cameraThere are lots of better platformer games out there. Voodoo Vince is not one of them.\n",
      "This game is terrible!!!  The game doesn't give you any idea of where the ball is going which results in:Having no idea where serves are going to go.Never knowing whether or not the ball will be out.Having no idea where to go when the player lobs it.This was the most frustrating, un-fun videogame I have ever played in my life.  STAY AWAY FROM IT COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Wost game I have ever played for Xbox by far.  Lucky for me I didn't drop 50 bucks on this game, I rented it.  Don't even bother doing that.  The game play is awful, the graphics suck, the sound is annoying, and the playbook is $#!+.  Avoid this game, if you must play online, get the ESPN game, much better.\n",
      "I must say that this is one of the worst games I have played since Outpost. The manual is utterly useless. It has hardly any solid information about the controls or flow of the game. The controls are non-intuitive and sluggish. The game play is very poor and kluggy. This game is so bad, I thought there must be a patch for it. But I was wrong. I am playing this on a P4 H/T with a GB of RAM and a G-Force video card. Unless you enjoy disappointment, avoid this game at all cost.\n",
      "Want a game so bad it will give you nightmares.  So bad your eyes will bleed.  So bad you'll swear your GBA is possessed by a demon.  Well this is that game.  Now listen, I like Yu Yu Hakusho, I think it's a great story and a spectacular TV series.  But, this game stinks.  Lets begin by talking about the graphics.  The people look like they escaped from an old Atari 2600 game.  The enviroments look decent at first, then you realize that all the places look exactly the same.  I must have gone by this couch twenty times.  And then there's the audio.  The music is painful to say the least.  But the music isn't nearly as bad as the actual gameplay.  You're basically fighting or playing stupid mini-games like finding someone's homework.  Most mini-games will just involve following your compass from location to location.  Then you get to the fighting.  This is the stupidest part of the game.  First of all, everyone wants to get you.  Demons, school children, old ladies, everyone.  And they aren't exactly geniuses either.  The fighting isn't deep or involving.  Basically just mash the B button and you'll be fine.  So, the game isn't fun at all.  If your a die hard Yu Yu Hakusho fan you probably already have a copy.  As for everyone else, you might want to play a game that doesn't suck so much.\n",
      "Since it is a game based off of a popular anime I thought it would have been a pretty good game. But I was wrong. This is probably one of the worst games I have ever played, if the THE worst ever. I returned the game to GameStop as soon as I was able to.\n",
      "As I bought this case, for some reason I thought it would be able to hold my GBA SP safely, and maybe a game or two extra. Yes it holds the GBA SP, but nothing else. Getting a game out of the miniscule pouch is an exercise in pure masochism. A much better idea is to buy a small case for the older GBA, and then use that. The extra space intended for the older system will allow you to put in more games, and your SP. Buying this is like putting your GBA in a tight pocket in your jeans. You know it's there, and safe, but God help you if you can get it out.\n",
      "90% of gamers will only see the first 15% of this game- for there is a respawning never ending battle level that simply cannot be won (I'm not kidding). I am a relatively advanced gamer, and I have to say that this battle system is amongst the worst I have ever tried to play. It results in an unplayable game that will stop you 15% of the way through it. What a rip off! No kidding- no cheats, nothing you can do but try and try again- ultimately failing. I even brought in other advanced games who all looked at me like I was crazy for suggesting they try to beat this battle it is so ill conceived. Simply the worst game out there masking under the veil of nice graphics - too bad since they are gorgous (from what I saw of them). When are these game developers going to realize that 90% of gamers out there won't deal with quality this poor. I cannot beleive anyone has ever gotten past this level it's that hard and rediculously stacked in the favor of the game. Don't waste your time unless you want to play 15% of a game only to hit a massive brick wall. Shame on Ubisoft for allowing this garbage out on store shelves!\n",
      "I hate this fricking game!  Time and time again I screamed obscenities at the screen, throwing my controller down.  The game is just series of jumping off ledges, falling and trying again.  The battles feel like your running through mollasses.  The most annoying game I've ever played.  Just fancy graphics on top of a game you get free on your cellphone.\n",
      "There are somethings I'll never understand. Basic Geometry, how Michael Bolton became successful.....and how a great and iconic character like Batman can never have a decent video game. The first Batgame for Playstation 2, Vengence, had it's moments. Though it wasn't \"great\" it at least felt like a Batman game. Batman Dark Tomorrow was an outright disaster. And now it looks like Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu continues the downward slide for the Dark Knight.Rise of Sin Tzu's biggest downfall is it's gameplay. Where as Vengence attempted to be more of an adventure oriented game, Rise of Sin Tzu takes an entirely different approach. It's pretty much a straight forward beat 'em up game. But unfortunatley it doesn't know how to keep you interested in it to make you keep wanting to play. The game descends into punching and kicking your way past various non-descript bad guys and the occassional gas bomb lobbed in to the fray by the villain the Scarecrow. Two players can play in a co-operative mode simultaneously but it does little to change the gameplay. The game is interesting for about ten minutes then boredom quickley sets in. After the first few levels I could see that there was pretty much nothing else this game had to offer.The graphics on this game are decent. Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing all move with convincing ease and fluidity. But the environments are rather plain and sterile. They look like they could be just about any street anywhere. There was nothing to indicate that this was Gotham City. It could have been Cleveland for I knew. The sound was also very generic. Sure Batman and company uttered some pretty good \"one liners\", but it got old fast.The controls are very easy to manage. They are however wasted on a game like this. The time it will take you to become accustomed to the controls is maybe about five to ten minutes.This game managed to let me down on just about every level. I'm not even sure if a hardcore Batfan would even enjoy it. Ubi Soft has shamelessly squandered the potential for this licence. At this point the only thing that I think would inject new life into the franchise is if the game license changed hands and went to a company like Activision, Electronic Arts, Eidos or anyone else. If you can track down a copy of Batman: Vengence, you would be better served playing that. Though not perfect it's the better of the two Batman games.\n",
      "i am 16 hours into this game, and was very close to finishing. i enjoyed it a lot up to this point. but i cannot recommend this game to anyone, and i can only hope to steer clear any that try and buy this. after completing the slaughterhouse i went back to iris hq. funny thing is i was able to walk through double hh, which i thought was odd because he was usually in the way. well that's the last i saw of him. he never appeared again so i can't finish the game. [...]\n",
      "Whatever you do, do NOT buy this game!  The elevator battle towards the end of the game is the most poorly designed aspect in recent memory.  After more than 20 tries, I just couldn't beat it.  Whenever that happens, you know that a game is fatally flawed.Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.  Performing precise wall-run attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time.  Then, vaulting over enemies doesn't work all the time either.  Because of these facts, this game is poorly designed and fatally flawed.DO NOT BUY!\n",
      "This is horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The controls are tedious. The camera could not be worse. The game is touchy. I could not say \"STAY AWAY\" enough. I know many found this game fun, but I have been video gaming for over 25 years now and I say this is one of the worst!!!!!\n",
      "This game is way over rated!!!! camera problems, fighting control problems, and hyped up way too much!!! after reading reviews i expected the best game ever and now I feel robbed!! honestly i had more fun, actually WAY MORE FUN on the gameboy advance version!! with this title hope for the best , expect the worst...\n",
      "Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are &quot;cartoon&quot; horrible and the need for &quot;VR&quot; points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on &quot;VR&quot; points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either.\n",
      "This game is just bad all around.Bad gameplay,Bad graphics,Bad storyline,Bad voice acting.Just BAD! It really does suck! Hands down,the worst PS2 game I have ever played.\n",
      "This is the worst game anybody could play. The game's graphics were horrible-might as well give 'em to ps2......geez. The gameplay was crap, so fun driving an old car that goes like 5 mph just to drop somebody off. The thing that really pisses me off is that the cover of it makes it look to good. Really I mean you wanana have a good shooting-mafia time, but you can't when your driving your grandmas car the whole time........ I reccomend you not renting/ or buying this game, its just not worth your time...Unless your new at games and yer Italian then well....whatevr....I would give this a 0 rating but I can't cuz Amazon wont let me lol.\n",
      "Pigs, cows, and women, oh my!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "This game is really bad and hard.  You start as a rancher, but making money is very hard, you have to marry raise kids, like in real life, but it's not as it sounds, it's boring,cause you have to do everything all the time. Bottom line Don't buy it, if you haven't played the other ones\n",
      "This product didn't work at all. This is the third one I bought. Don't buy used. I am not mad. It's just that it doesn't work.\n",
      "Game doesn't work.  Light scratches my butt.  So yeah sucks for me I guess.  At least I can use the game as a coaster.\n",
      "Only die hard Yu-Gi-Oh fans could possibly find a slim bit of enjoyment in this game.It amazes me it is listed as third over all in Amazon's top seller list cause that tells me many are flocking in like sheep to waste their money on this game.There are at least 500 games i would want to own before i even considered this title.Heck I'd rather dust off the old N64 or even Super Nes and play some of those games before i put any time into this one.The graphics are very last generation (would only call the graphics &quot;ok&quot; even if it was on the playstatin 1) The game is not very fun,not much depth here,not much style.If it wasn't a Yu-Gi-Oh title and had made up characters and the same gameplay,everyone would be trading this one in at a used game store fast.I guess there are a few people out there who think its a cool game cause they say &quot;wow i know that character and that one to from Yu-Gi-Oh&quot; thats about the only thing positive you'll get out of the game,recognizing the characters...end of positive things to say about the game.If my opinion isn't enough,make sure you check out IGN and Gamepro reviews on this game before you go throwing away your money on this game for some kids birthday or Christmas gift.Most kids will be let down and having other titles in mind they wish you had gotten them instead if they open this as a Christmas gift.Prince of Persia,Beyond Good and Evil,Sphynx and the Mummy,Metal Arms:Glitch in the System,and Mario Kart are just a few examples of games that should be under your tree this year for your kids way before you ever consider this poor attempt at a Yu-Gi-Oh game.If you are stubborn and want to take a chance on this game at least rent it first so you don't foolishly throw away your money without seeing for yourself how lacking in fun this title is.\n",
      "This game just clings on to the title of Yu-Gi-Oh!It is like PokeMon Stadium only with an actual storyline.Go pick up the uncut YGO dvds, import the dvds, or play one of the YGO GBA rpgs; but avoid this game.\n",
      "Let's face it - Twin Snakes blows. Anyone who says it's good is totally lying to themselves or has not played the original MGS1 for PS1.A majority of the cut-scenes were unnecessary and really stupid. Snake does some super-human moves that just ridiculous - this isn't The Matrix or some Steven Seagal movie.\n",
      "I purchased MGS for GameCube and wish I hadn't. If you removed the laboriously long cut scenes there's actually very little game here. I get the impression Hideo wanted to make a film but could only get a job directing a video game and decided to make a film anyway.The controls and camera are very cumbersome and the bad guys always see you before you can see them. The weapons are very standard - no imagination there. I would have given the game three stars if not for two ridiculous features I've found that totally spoil it. I think Hideo has a crappy sense of humor.First, there's a spot early in the game where one of the characters tells you to use a radio frequency 'on the back of the package'. I went through the whole game again trying to find the package he was refering to. It turns out he's refering to the package the game came in! Talk about less than total immersion!Second was one of the bosses who can only be hurt if you use controller three. What the **** it this ****?One star and I'm being generous. If I ever see Hideo's name on another video game I'm going to run a mile.\n",
      "The first time I ordered this, I didn't get the greatest hits version, and the game played horribly.By horrible, I mean it would get stuck on load times and the loading icon would turn red as a sign that basically, it wasn't gonna load no matter how long I waited. I thought this was a problem with my playstation 2, but to my surprise, this has happened to many people with the first version of the game. I did not enjoy this and ended up buying a second copy, but the greatest hits kind off of ebay. This copy worked fine and I havent had a problem since. Do not buy the regular version of this game, buy the greatest hits version which is red at the top and says greatest hits.Aside from the disc...This game for playstation 2 has amazing graphics and a really wide selection of cars. It's pretty awesome, and also cool using a driving wheel. I'd recommend this game.\n",
      "I was so looking forward to this game and now that I finally got to play it, it is a HUGE disapointment.  Sure there are some minor improvements over GT3, but they certainly aren't worthy of all the development time that went into this game.Those minor improvments are:  better graphics, improved physics engine (so they claim), more race tracks, slightly better car selection (a few more American cars now, but still none of the top racing brands, and way too many obscure Japanese cars that no body cares to use anyway.  Sure there are 600+ cars but most of them are just cheap filler, like 20 versions of the same car).  Most of the added features are just cheap gimmicks, like taking pictures of your cars; who cares???The biggest thing that's missing is ONLINE PLAY!!! What happened? They promised online play for GT4 and it's not here! With out this major feature there really isn't much reason to buy this game!  Now we'll all just have to wait and hope that Forza Motorsport for XBox (which will have online play) will be able to deliver on what GT4 didn't!!Save yourself $30 hard earned dollars and spend $20 on GT3 instead, and if you already own GT3, don't waste $50 on this minor update.\n",
      "Just as a disclaimer, my standards are very low when it comes to racing games. So when I say this game sucks, I mean most normal gamers will think this game sucks.I loved GT3 so I thought this would be an improvement. But I was wrong. This game sucks in every possible way, interface sucks, the graphics are worse than GT3, and the events are the same as GT3. The license tests are embarrassing to the franchise.I was hesitant to buy the game in the first place but after I saw the positive reviews on amazon (124 5stars and 36 1stars) I thought that many people can't be wrong, but I was SOOO WRONG. Those people were either paid off to make good reviews or the sellers of the game made fake reviews to con us into buying it. Either way they were wrong.PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on this game.\n",
      "it is the worst driving game i ever played the cars turn on there own i tried everything to stop them from turning even when u are on a straight road they turn on there own it sucks do not buy and the license sucks\n",
      "Mario party 5 is the worst out of all of them! The super duel mode is poor because the cars are slow, the capsules was a dumb idea because your never sure what your going to get and they dont do anything good at all. Most of the mini games are boaring and the levels are boaring also. They lost their touch! I asked my dad for it on christmas because I thought it would be better then all the other ones I played. Major disappointment! If you have a Gamecube get Mario party 4. Thats just my opinion though!\n",
      "THIS game is really bad if you like party games get PAC MAN FEVER or Warioware inc. Its boring mario party 1 2 3 4 are ok but common they are ALL the same exept they took out the good games for the bad ones!!! DONT buy it!!!\n",
      "Its true. First of all its not as fun as Mario party 1,2,or 3. This is not good at all. Youll probably want Mario party 1,2,&amp; 3.A person would probably fell disappointed If they bought Mario party 4 or even this. I think they will make a mario party 6. They dident did do a very good job with this or even mario party 4 or even this. They however did a good job with mario party 1,2,&amp; 3.\n",
      "Ok, now if this game was the very first mario party game ever, then i would like it.  BUT COME ON!!! There r already 4 MARIO PARTY GAMES!!! AND THEY R ALL EXACTLY THE SAME!!!! O sure, there might be a few differen't mini games and crap but ITS THE SAME EXACT CONCEPT!!! AHHHHH!!! IM GONNNA DIE!!!  The only reason you should buy this game is if you have NEVER EVER played a mario party game before or if u don't have ANY mario party games.  IT would just be wasting your money if u collected all these games.  And if you've never played a mario party game but wanna buy one, i would say u should probably buy an older one becuase the older ones r ALOT CHEAPER and still EXACTLY THE SAME!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\n",
      "It's just another Mario Party game. There aren't any high expectations for it. All I expect from this is a mediocre virtual board game with lousy graphics and boring sound. And that's just what Mario Party 5 is. I rate this game 37/100.\n",
      "I'M NOT VERY FOND OF THIS GAME FOR MANY,MANY REASONS.HERE ARE SOME OF THEM1.STUPID COUSES.2.LACK OF MODES!3.LACK OF MINIGAMES!4.LACK OF CHARACTERS!5.EASY COMPETTITON!THOSE AREN'T EVEN ONE THIRD OF MY COMPLANTS.\n",
      "I can get as far as installing it. Then whenever I try to start it I get DirectX 3D errors. Don't get the PC version if you have a laptop- and even with a desktop, make sure all your audio/video card drivers are up to date- or this game is essentially a $30 coaster. I've uninstalled it and am waiting for Vivendi to release a patch(if they ever will, that is). My brother has a Gamecube, so I bought that version of the game, and It was good. But I never could get this one to work on my laptop.\n",
      "I don't often review games, but I had to write in on this one. This game was pretty bad. Soem major plot flaws. Some horrible control (can't control the camera on foot missions) and just plain stupid elelments like &quot;sonic weapons&quot; in space. When I came across that, I just turned the game off. Fortunately I rented this because I wasn't sure I like it. I loved Rogue 2 and it's one of my favorite games. I liked the idea of flying some missions with a friend, but the single player version is dumb dumb DUMB.People who like this game probably also like Jar-Jar.\n",
      "This disaster is the worst looking x-box title out there ,the game looks like a 5 year old p.c. game! I basicly threw away 50 bucks on this pile! I should have read the reviews for this game as I see lots of other people think the same thing. beware of this steaming heap!\n",
      "If your looking for a good star wars game get knights of the old republic, if your looking for a action game get prince of persia. This game is not good in any way shape or form.\n",
      "Please do not buy this game. Thankyou. Ok seriously onto the review. I rented this game because I was thinking about buying it so I picked my character, which you could choose a boy, girl, alien then I am off on my adventure. Immediately I noticed that the graphic are no up to par with standard X box games and that the movement was quirky. I have played games with these kind of problems if they were fun but this game also has bugs. On the first stage I went to chop down the tree and the guy would not run across the log, another time I got stuck in the log, and yet another time I through my sword and it didn't come back. I don't like the fact that if you stand next to a friendly character that you can kill them simply by having your light saber within touching distance of them. Overall I would have to say this game could have been great but it was clearly rushed for the holiday season, I hate when publishers do that, thanks Lucasarts.\n",
      "This game went wrong in a lot of ways. Warlords III: Reign of Heroes and Dark Lords Rising were awesome games, nearly perfect in their execution. Warlords: Battlecry II was also in itself an incredible game.Along comes Warlords IV, which tries to mix the two games, and fails miserably. Most of the cool features from Warlords III are gone, apparently in the name of \"simplification\". While a lot of the animations and sound effects from Battlecry II are ripped off the original game and presented here in a very stripped-down way.I wanted to like this game, but it is just such a departure (in a bad way) from the two games that it is based off of. I have no problem with gaming innovation, but this isn't innovation. This is just plain bad programming.As another reviewer stated, it really seems like the developers of this game ran into some budget problems and just \"threw it out there\", so to speak. The new warlord system just really stinks. And the heroes, which were so cool and played such an important part in both WL3 and Battlecry 2, are conspicuously weak in this game. They are all wimps! I don't know why they are even included in the game, because the moment you put them in a battle they are guaranteed to die right off the bat.And the vectoring system which was so useful in WL3 is now absent. The units actually have to travel ON SCREEN from where they are produced. This is more realistic, perhaps, but it certainly calls for some micromanagement to make sure your units out wandering alone don't get slaughtered while you aren't looking.The only good thing I could say about this game is that the graphics are somewhat improved from WL3. Even so, most of the animations are still just ripped directly off of Battlecry II, so we're not seeing anything innovative here. In fact, the graphics in Battlecry II beat this mish-mashed hodgepodge of a game by a long shot.Besides, graphics alone does not a good game make. Warlords 3, while having graphics that are now showing their age, is a FAR superior game to this one. (And I STILL highly recommend it for turn-based strategy game lovers! WL3 is an excellent game indeed.)This game was really disappointing. It shows a lot of potential with the ideas used, but the execution was horrible to say the least. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it.\n",
      "I've never had so much trouble getting a game to play.  My pc more than meets the recommended requirements and it seems like it's full of bugs.The cars are way too hard to drive.  You have to use keys to turns left or right, they aren't mouse controlled.  For pete's sake, let gamers quicksave whenever they want!  I hate hate hate not being able to save.  Who wants to get so far only to get killed and have to backtrack through gameplay--not fun!  It's also a major ordeal getting cheatcodes that work.  Some do, most don't.  Huge disapointment.  I've had it with pc games like this.  Never again.\n",
      "Not worth the time or the money.....I bought this after playing Far Cry III, and it was a mistake.  FCIII is a great game but this one does nothing worth talking about.\n",
      "I can't believe I paid money for this.  This is the only game I intend to throw away once I pass it.  I'm only still playing it because I'm trying to get my money's worth.  First, thegraphics are not the best quality and yes, I do have a current video card with all of its uodates.  Whenever I shoot someone in the far distance I get blood pixelating before my eyes blocking my view.  The game freezes every few minutes.  I can't adjust the sound so I have to turn up my speaksers just to hear the gun shots and the voice overs are drowned out by the background noises.  What little dialogue I've heard was horrible voice overs.  The story is stupid.  I'm a professional story-teller so I'm picky about good quality stories.  I can't wait to get this game over with.  This game wasn't worth the gas money I spent to buy it.\n",
      "This game is over due for the bone yard, it will not load in the latest 64 bit operating systems. I'll let this copy go cheap.\n",
      "This review is most certainly going to warrant the \"un-helpful\" from the most avid, politically-correct reviewers, as they will most certainly see that this is not a review of Far Cry, and I of all people do not especially enjoy spotting those reviewers who have never even touched the games in which they are so unhappily ranting, however; the games today are asking for an all-out lawsuit in blatant misrepresentation.  Fortunately for them, the least they will get are our reviews bringing the magic tricks into the light.It seems as if the game developers, in amidst a chaos of illegal downloading and cd copying have sent a huge unnoticed cluster bomb in the way of those who are actually supporting their economic ventures - and is the unavailability to play their games the thanks we get?  Absolutely.I am very disappointed in the games that have been released throughout the last few years - not for the lack of creativity or poor design - but for the lack of a better guide for those who actually care about the quick buck of our beloved game makers.  Remember that silly little NVIDIA-tag commercial that jumps into action right before you enter the game?  It has that cheesy motto spread like butter right over the monitor screen:  It says, \"The way it's meant to be played.\"  As much as I don't appreciate the trendiness this  motto implies as a lackluster commercial for the games we have already bought into - it does make an interesting point referring to games in general - This F@&$in' game is actually meant to be PLAYED!?  Shocking, is it not?  Who would have thought?Well, apparently not to the millions of people who bought into the game only to realize the game makers have withheld crucial information and they have thwarted the very people who they are attempting to sell the game to.What in sin am I talking about?  Misrepresentation.You don't sell an electric saw that malfunctions in a basic electric outlet without warning the audience in bright bold letters, do you not?  You will be sued for negligence.Far Cry must be the exception in the eyes of the publishers/game makers.  For instance, Far Cry will not work on CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW at all.  This is a far crying shame, not because I can't play the game, but because I should have been warned before I tipped my dollar hand.  Why can't we have a nice big sparkly label on the front of the box which clearly states that we can't play the game if we have the basic outlets?!Game developers are starting to get the hang of not letting us in on their dirty little secrets - so they can make bank, and we get nothing in return except for a couple discs that will not install.  And I know these are good games, but we must be warned about deviations for the basic hardware that our computers have, right?Far cry is far from being the only one on this train wreck.  Myst IV, has the same problem as Far cry, but for the DVD re-writable drives.  I didn't run into THAT problem, but certainly there was no specific label that could be found.  Is this the way we are supposed to treat our consumers?Thief 3 and Deus Ex: Invisible War will not run on computers with the NVIDIA Graphics card.  This is not an average problem that many will commonly run into due to the fact most people have a NVIDIA graphics card.  These games don't need to include the NVIDIA cards, but they certainly need to include their audience in this decision - right?  I want to see the nice gold label on the front of the box that says \"Won't work with NVIDIA Cards.\"  Save us the trouble, right?!And then Half-life 2.  The only single player game to come out with the required use of an internet nearest you.  Yes, I see that ten font sentence on the bottom of the box now - but wouldn't it have been that much easier to warn everyone in advance?  Even the magazine gamers that have played this game didn't happen to mention this - I expected much better.  How the hell did they even play the game without noticing this?  Unless, the publishers didn't mention that to them - but that's doubtful.  Well, I've canceled my PC Gamer subscription - Amazon reviewers aren't as likely to pass up such details; we don't get paid for playing games or paid if our games do not work properly.  Sure, they'll get away with it -because this information was included at the bottom of the box, but surely there was someone up in the big office warning everyone not to let this fart out into the open - and they should be ashamed.These sloppy misrepresentations have alienated me as a gamer - and I for one will NOT buy a recently released game until I have looked into at least fifty of the reviews - because it is obvious the developers will continue to use this \"Don't tell\" policy.  I suggest you consider doing the same thing - because refunds are hard to come by in the gaming world.  Enjoy Far Cry - I have yet to play it.\n",
      "Decided to give Far Cry a chance, now that I bought a new computer ... read the conflicting reports on compatibility ... even went to UBI Software to see the \"issues\" with the game ... best I could tell; if you have virtual copying software the game won't run = WRONG ... I contacted Customer support and was told: \"Far Cry will not run on CD-RW or DVD-RW drives ... I will need to install a basic CD drive\" ... wasted $17 and now I'm wondering if Splinter Cell: Pandora's Tomorrow will run ... I'm not jumping through video game company hoops to play their games ... I'll buy another FPS/RPG/RTS that works on my system \"as it is\" ... yes, a basic CD drive is cheap, but I'm physically disabled and not going to pay someone $50 to install a $20 part to play one game/one game company's product that cost $20(... I never pay $40-50 - I wait till the hype is over)\n",
      "This game has some kind of program that causes sudden drops in framerate, freezes, and untimely loading actions, although the graphics are excellent, this game was poorly programed. I would like to know the people that programed this mess, to see if they are mentally retarded. This game does not have the looks, or feel of ubisoft. This game isn't anything like Silent Hunter 3. I have never given such a bad review as this, but I felt that I must , inorder to warn other gamers. there are a lot of first person shooters out there that is a lot better. The reviewer that stated something about having a crappy computer, let me tell you something, BOZO... I have a Gateway 550GR pentium 4, 3.4 gig processor with H/T ,over a gig of DDR overclocking memory, 200 gig hard drive, ati radeon pci EXPRESS 128 meg graphics card with all the bells and whistles. I have a top of the line computer, but I still have problems. This game needs a patch ASAP. As for the reviewer that stated that he has played it once, and now he is going to play it twice, he probably have the farcry cheats. I have the farcry cheats, and have finished the game also,with all the settings set to very high,and ultra high. YOU SEE AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME AFTER YOU KILL THE LAST SCIENTIST ON THE VOLCANO, YOU RESCUE THE FINE LADY, JUMP ON A SHIP, AND GIVE HER THE SERUM, THAT KEEPS HER FROM BECOMING A MUTANT, THE .....END. My reviiew will stay the same, the water doesn't look as good as the water in Blackhawk Down, doesn't even come close to the water in silent hunter3 OR Pirates of the Caribean, Thank You p.s. go to ...cheaters heavens, you will find a zip file, download this file to your desktop, then extract all to the farcry folder.,and have yourself some fun.\n",
      "I'm shocked so many people like this game. I found it to be bad all around, even for its time. Unreal is much, much better in my opinion. The aiming is off & it seems a bit confused as to what it's trying to be. Lackluster experience all around here.\n",
      "Just a friendly warning to all CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW drive owners.  UBI Soft as a \"feature\" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in \"some\" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.UBI Soft's tech support has said that this \"feature\" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  \"Flawed\" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.I'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their \"feature\", not about the game itself.\n",
      "How in the world can a game like this be released?  It is unexceptable.  You can not control your man.  What may be cursor key straight ahead in one camera shot, will be left in the next...though you are still hitting the forwad cursor. Your man never stands straight, he's always at an angle and you are guessing which cursor key to hit...oops pick the wrong one and you're off the cliff. It is this insanity throughout.  It is absolutley impossible to control your man and the camera angle.  Decent 3rd-person role-playing games are like Star Wars Jedi Outcast or Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness.  The camera should station behind your character so that you can move your mouse and cursor keys accordingly....hello? Game Developers! Every PLAY one of these games before making one and putting it out on the market and charging $45 bucks!?!?  Morons.\n",
      "The graphics are ugly and resemble a cartoon. The worst part though is the stupid phrases that come out of the turtles' mouth(talk about annoying). A game that little kids would enjoy, not adults.\n",
      "The seller was smart-gamer. I paid 5 bucks. It worked fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3.There is no story. Just a shoot 'em up. I thought it was boring...not fun.I would rather replay a game that I previously enjoyed than play this game for the first time.

      "I want Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection made by Microsoft Game Studios in the U.S.But, I think most of these games are from Ubisoft, a European company. If it is from Ubisoft, the game can be installed in English, Dutch, German and a couple other languages. If you have the necessary system requirements, the game will probably work on your computer.\n",
      "Right off the bat this game does almost everything wrong... The combat is dumbed down from the original Butokai, forcing an unnecessary and tedious RPG element. The difficulty is horribly scaled and no preset difficulty option exists. The game strays as far as it can from the story without straying far enough to make the game a unique and enjoyable experience. I get what they where trying to do with changing the game from a linear story to a board game but the execution was just awful. The original budokai had a better story and tournament mode and also more of a character selection with each character having better and time appropriate move-pools (when you fight Frieza the first time you will have access to the spirit bomb). The more modern Butokai Tenkaichi 3 has the series' best combat and this game just is not worth your money when both it's predecessor and successor are vastly superior. In this case talent definitely skipped a generation! (I am so tired of fighting colored Saibamen.)\n",
      "Ok if your a die hard fan of dbz....then go ahead buy u may like it, like this other fool did, but beaware this game SUCKS there are no good points remember the old one had a story mode which was like living out the cartoon, this one doest have that this one suck all the wayyyyyyysorry to bust uall's bubble.\n",
      "I suppose this rating isn't quite fair as I haven't given them a chance to address the problems.  I have installed it on three systems, Windows 8, xp, and 2000.  It installs without a hitch and then starts erratically, usually locking up, and mostly requiring a reboot to get out.  I'm running Bit Defender, and although I suspect that's where the problem, Bid Defender never reports any problem and the installation completes as successful.\n",
      "After berating the game makers for being over five months late in releasing this game and then belittling them for dropping the price to a bargain-bin amount of 20 bucks even before it hit the shelves, my pre-review for this game concluded by saying:\"Being such a hard-core adventure game fanatic, if and when it finally does come out, I'll gladly play it.  Like the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as bad chocolate'.  But, at this point, I'm not holding my breath for some Godiva-like quality with this one.\"Well, the game did finally arrive and after playing it for a couple of hours last night, I can honestly say that this game is actually like the product \"Mocklate\" in the 'Friends' episode where Monica is hired to cheerfully promote the faux-product.  It looks just like chocolate, but it leaves a really BAD taste in your mouth!My wife and I really love to play adventure games, it is the only game genre we play.  If you've seen some of our other game reviews, you will know this is true.  While the initial episode of Crystal Key was inexplicably a strong seller, the game itself was not exactly earth-shattering.  We've played a lot of adventure games and 'The Crystal Key' ranks well down on our list of favorites (but, by all means, not at the bottom).  It was just a good, solid, average adventure game.  When they announced a sequel, we figured that they probably learned from the competition, grown along with the technology of gaming, and created a new chapter of the story that matches or exceeds the original.Boy, could that NOT be further from the truth.  This game is truly awful!  With the delays and price-chopping factored in, we had set our expectations exceedingly low.  But, some how, they managed to sink even well below that level.  The pre-released screen shots and trailer for the game cannot prepare you for how bad the actual gameplay really is.  Here are just a few of the CONs to the game (there are no PROs):-The graphics are even worse than the original game (which is almost five years old now).  Like the first game, they are pre-rendered, 360 degree panning shots that you are forced to navigate from point to point.  However, the textures and details of these graphics are far worse than in game one.  Every scene looks washed out and out of focus.  Plus, the cylindrical views actually \"jumped and popped\" as we turned which got exceedingly annoying after a while.-The music soundtrack, I am not kidding, sounds like it was dubbed from a porno movie!  I think they meant to give the game a \"hipper\" beat but, oh my, I don't think they intended to make THAT association.-The characters of the game are immovable, pixilated add-ins that show absolutely no emotion.  The voice-over acting is adequate, but the dialog is sophomoric at best.This drivel looks like it was created by a twelve-year-old, indy game developer using an old 386 computer.  Unfortunately, the list of credits for this game includes many members of a professional creative team!  I would have been much more lenient with my review had it actually been an independent creation.  ...\n",
      "Don't you just love a game that has technical problems right off the bat. I installed this game without any difficulties and the game would not launch. So I uninstalled the game, disabled my anti-virus, and reinstalled the game. Still would not launch. So $20 completely wasted because I cannot even start the game. I wrote technical support for the Adventure Company - we'll see if they even bother to respond. They didn't the last time I wrote them about a completely different problem with another one of their games.I ended up having to get a new video card in order to play this game. Although, I'm sure it will come in handy for future games it was a complete waste of money regarding this game.I hated this game and I admit that I could not even finish it. The graphics were absolutely terrible, bad enough that it made gaming more difficult since I often couldn't make out what I was looking at. I attempted to play this game right after playing Syberia II. I don't expect every game to look as beautiful and detailed as the Syberias but this game looks like something that could have been produced 10 years ago.The other thing that drove me crazy was the music. For some reason the game had a jazz-like soundtrack. That would be fine if the game took place in New Orleans or Chicago instead of some planet elsewhere in the galaxy.I do my best to finish games (after all who wants to waste the money) no matter how bad they are. I just couldn't do it with this one.\n",
      "I just installed this game and played it for 5 minutes and I literally want to  throw up. The graphics are awesome and the game looks like it would be really fun, if it weren't for the 1st person navigation system. This full 360 degree viewing is totally gross. it's like you are inside a sphere, and when you move the mouse the sphere rolls the screen around, so every single thing you want to look at requires the entire screen to move, at a disgusting rate. i slowed the mouse movement down as far as it would go but it was still like i was on a rollercoaster. Have you ever seen clockwork orange? you know how they forcefeed the guy images to cure him and he freaks out, well that's how i felt after 5 seconds of game play. 15 minutes later now, and i still have motion sickness. give me still images please!!\n",
      "I have not been able to play this game yet.  It would have been nice to know that you need a video card that supports TnL before I bought it.  Costing I found around 100.00 bucks.  So now I have to wait till I can afford it.  The company should have written somewhere that you need this, because I read the box, and the requirements before hand, and it said nothing about needing this video card.  Now I am stuck with a game I can't play right away.....thanks alot!!\n",
      "Regarding the puzzles in this game, apparently, the publisher didn't learn.  This is a set of impossibly hard, arbitrary puzzles masquerading as an adventure game.  Basically, read the lowest rated reviews here for the earlier game, Schizm, and you'll see what this game is like.\n",
      "An old Ross Perot quote pretty much sums up this game: &quot;You're going to hear a giant sucking noise&quot; as you play this game.  Whoo, baby, does this game stink!  I thought that 'The Crystal Key II' (another recent Dreamcatcher/Adventure Company game) was pretty awful, but I did not know there was a whole other level of bad below that!  Holy cow, how does dreck like this manage to get published with such flashy and professional packaging and marketing?Jeez, where to start?  How about with the incredibly bad interface.  The game is a standard point-and-click adventure game where you navigate from point to point and then pan around in 360 degree views.  Panning requires you to hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse in the direction you want to pan.  What is so awful about this interface is that when you have dragged your mouse the entire width of your mousepad, you have only panned about one quarter of way around the view.  You then have to lift and reposition your mouse to drag it some more in the direction you are panning!  Most games have an option to correct this by letting you set the mouse sensitivity to a speed that you (and your video card) are comfortable with.  Is that option available here? NO! Can you pan with your keyboard instead? NO! As a matter of fact there are absolutely NO games options whatsoever!  You are stuck with one panning rate, one music volume, one dialog volume (a real shame since the dialog is putrid), and...you get the picture.Getting an item into your inventory is pretty easy (just click on it), but getting it out is absolutely painful.  You first have to click on a screen icon to pull up your inventory list, click on an item to see a larger view of it in the middle of your screen, click on that large image to change your cursor into a representation of that item, and then click on the exit button of the inventory screen.  Finally you then have to click on the game spot where you think the item might be useful.  Unfortunately, you typically have no clue as to what might work at a specific hot spot, so you end up trying EVERYTHING in your inventory to see if something works (and there is a lot of junk in there sometimes)!The puzzles of the game are a joke.  As a matter of fact, the very first two puzzles you encounter are pretty much the same thing: try to find the correct sequence of clicks to get all the way through the puzzle; if you guess wrong, start over!  They don't get much more imaginative beyond that.  My game came with a &quot;limited edition&quot; game strategy guide included free.  I'm guessing that all of them will come with this guide because, otherwise, nobody will be able to (nor want to) finish this embarrassment.As a final insult, the developers thought they would try to spice up their incoherent game by adding a lot of humor.  Done well, humor can add a very entertaining aspect to an adventure game.  The classic Zork games are excellent examples.  When done badly, as in this case, it just becomes irritating to the point of distraction.  Most of it is just not funny (okay, maybe to a six year old) and does not &quot;fit&quot; in the atmosphere of this game.  Jive talking jungle natives?  Please.Again, like Crystal Key II, this looks like the work of an independent game developer who has spent years putting together a workable game using &quot;knives and bearskins&quot;.  If so, I would have admired the work and enjoyed the game for what it was.  Unfortunately, this game was, again, developed by what looks to be a large team (Hexagon).  Games like these give the game genre, which I love the most, a huge black eye and are probably the reason why so many people get turned off by adventure games.  What a shame, because there are some really good ones out there.  Unfortunately, you have to dig through a lot of dung like this to find it.  Avoid this game.\n",
      "The Adventure Company has a knack for taking high concepts and making them into terrible games.  Take for example \"The Mystery of the Mummy\", a Sherlock Holmes mystery game that made the world's most famous detective seem insipid.  As lousy as some of their attempts have been in the past, high concepts keep players coming back to The Adventure Company.  \"Jack the Ripper\" has a concept so ideal it seems impossible to ruin, and yet the game is phenomenally atrocious.The game is set in New York City in 1901.  A couple of poverty-stricken showgirls have been murdered in a fashion similar to the Jack the Ripper killings of 1888.  Jimmy Palmer, a na've young reporter, is assigned by his editor to write a series of newspaper articles on the killings.  As Jimmy looks into the murders, he discovers that the same serial killer might be responsible for both the 1888 and 1901 murders.  There's the high concept.  The game play is from the first-person perspective of Jimmy from beginning to end.  It consists of returning to the same locations and talking to the same people repeatedly, using dialogue options that aren't really all that optional.  Occasionally, Jimmy can collect items such as keys and money to appease stubborn suspects.  There are only one or two actual puzzles in the entire game.The game parades many characters based loosely on actual suspects in the real-life Jack the Ripper murders, but Jimmy never seems to come any closer to solving the mystery.  A game called \"Jack the Ripper\" should at least guarantee a creepy ambience, and the game seems to succeed in that area initially, but it soon becomes apparent that ambience isn't enough.  Menacing footsteps when no one is following you, whispered dialogue that is unintelligible and unimportant to the storyline, and shady characters that can't be interacted with and don't contribute anything to the plot become annoying after a short while.  In one room, a hushed, secretive whisper resembling \"I can sell you the most beautiful radishes\" can be heard repeatedly.  Dark, blood-stained alleys lose their creepiness after a while.  The score is beautiful and unnerving, but it only adds to the misleading feeling that something frightening is going to happen, and it hardly ever does.  There are also several moments in the game where Jimmy appears to have a psychic connection with a raven, leading to trippy graphic sequence with no pay-off.Many critics have noted the series of Irish folk tunes performed by one of the game's characters as a bright spot.  The songs themselves are beautiful and haunting, like the game's score, but the animated performances that accompany them are less varied and more mechanical than a floorshow at Chuck E. Cheese's.  Also, be warned that there isn't a twist ending, just an anticlimactic one.  Maybe someday still The Adventure Company will redeem itself.  In the meantime, avoid this game.\n",
      "I played No One Lives Forever 2. That was a great game. Funny, clever and involved.I finished this game on the 2nd hardest setting in 3 hours!!!Angry and feeling ripped off, I set the game to the hardest setting and tried again - I got through it in 4 hours - ONLY 4 HOURS !!!!!! PATHETIC!!!!Contract Jack is a sad attempt to cash in on that success.The weapons are limited and boring.The enemy AI is easy to figure out and beat, even on the hardest settings.The missions are lack luster. You keep waiting for something clever...it never comes.This is an absolute rip off.

Ummm.....what was up with the static clips the whole time... i mean i know the camera is kinda well, yeah filming but this is a game not an old camera, and if it is then that is more of a reson not to buy this game. Everything sucked, camera angles, guns were ok but still, doesnt really make you want to kick sum ass, and well the worst thing that happened to me was that i was on the last level and i needed some help to figure out what i was suppossed to do (I guess it was the special moves) and i started a new game, knowing that my original save would still be there, and guess what happened? ALL my manhunt saves were deleted.Wow! fun game! If you like this to give it 5 stars, you havent played a real video game.\n",
      "Maybe this game was  controversial when released.  I guess that was part of  the attraction.But the game  play is rather dull.  For a great deal of the game, you walk around with a club.  Clubbing people to death just doesn't do it for my  like the flash of a gun muzzle.You have to sneak up on people to kill them, or you get mauled.  Stealth is fun to a point, but its tedious after three or four levels.  After two levels of nothing but clubs and  bricks, I was like \"enough already! Bring on the guns!\"Just plain boring.\n",
      "Before purchasing this product, do a quick web search on Riven to read about all the compatibility problems that people have had with this game.

      "This is the saddest excuse for a game I have ever seen. I did not want to spend any of my hard earned money watching fat men in tights hug eachother. Sorry but I just don't flow that way. Nevertheless for all the people who do I still do not recommend this game for these key reasons-1. The game lacks in storyline and shouldn't be set to standard with any other fighting game in the history of the gaming revolution2. The graphics and playline engine are near non-existent and makes you feel like your playing pong3. The game is way to pricey for its real value. The fact of the matter is, is that this game costs nothing whatsoever but even if I had the chance to get the game again for free I wouldn't. Thats how much it sucks!\n",
      "Yeah, so I bought this game because I saw Sean O' Haire was in this game, and I always thought of him as an excellent wrestler. I loved him and the other Natural Born Thrillers in WCW and it's a shame WWE didn't do more with his devil's advocate character. Also, Ultimo Dragon was in this game, which I remember seeing online that he was coming to WWE. As far as I knew, those two were never in any other WWE games...And the main reason, I bought this game is...................................This game is from pretty much the exact time RIGHT before I gave up on watching professional wrestling. I watched from like 96 to 2002...some of 2003 and 2004...and it just wasn't the same at all. I feel sad saying that. Like I'm now discussing a past romantic relationship that ended very horribly with feelings being deeply hurt. But there, I said it! So yeah, I got a burst of nostalgia looking at the roster and thought, for the price a used copy goes for, why not?Well,let me tell you why not to buy this game.1) As another reviewer said, I think he was more generous and gave the game 3 stars, this game is SO UNBALANCED. So yeah, I'm Shawn O' Haire and Roddy Pipper is my tag team partner. We have one match, and then win the tag team titles. I am fine playing against the Guerreos. But then the game keeps putting me against Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit...you know those guys who have like 20 points higher than I do on all my stats?!? So yeah, no matter how good I was I couldn't block a LOT of their attacks. Also, their momentum to gain a finisher builds up faster and their finishers do more damage than mine do. So I went to RAW and the game threw me against STEVE AUSTIN, THE ROCK, and GOLDBERG...Same thing happened. Couldn't beat any of these guys, but other opponents, with stats similar to mine, I could have a good match with.I fought the ROCK in the gym area, and after like 4 to 5 finishers, he wouldn't stay down long enough for me to pin him. Then the Rock gives me 1...REPEAT 1 Rock Bottom and I get pinned. VERY FAIR!!! Did they even test this??? Wrestlemania 2000 had a better career mode! Enuff said.2)So many animations. There are a lot of times the game will go into a mini movie to show someone pulling off a move. LET ME PLAY THE GAME!!!3) The referee will never count a pin if someone is in the ring, WRONG PLACE TO BE REALISTIC IN, GAME, but he will ALWAYS Get in the way when you are trying to strike, which then leads to your opponent getting a second to recover and attack you.4)The TAG MATCHES. The AI opponents outside the ring gain momentum and gain finishers. So you can be schooling your opponent and they make the tag. Then their partner comes in and does a finisher on you and BAM total 360...the match is over and you have lost.5)The controls feel very loose and are horrible. I can't tell you how many times I meant to climb the turnbuckle, and my character starts running. Then when you start running there is no way to stop running unless you attack your opponent or the air.6) Damage. When you take extreme damage. Your opponent gets up and holds themselves. Giving your opponent a COMPLETE opportunity to beat you down.7) Story mode is dumb. MY MAIN GRIPE IS STORY MODE IS GLITCHY. I've seen the same person scheduled the match before mine, and then he's in the next match with me...HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE??? Also, the game showed the Rock talking to me about our match that night, but then Goldberg was in the match.???You can move, but a lot of times there is no one to talk to in the outside arenas. I thought when I bought this game I could choose which superstars on the roster I wanted to interact with. In reality, you can watch and react to a bunch of spontaneous little cutscenes...that give you Superstar points which then let you challenge for different belts. But if you aren't a main guy, you will probably get beaten a lot and not get very far...like I did.8) I think graphics look horrible. I think the Day of REckoning graphics, which was released like a year later, actually looked good. This looks like garabage.9) Create a player is dumb. Seriously, you can't pick entrance music for your star!!! WWF ATTITUDE DID THIS BETTER AND IT WAS RELEASED HOW LONG AGO??? YOU WOULD THINK YOU COULD TURN OUT A BETTER PRODUCT THAN THE OLD DESIGNERS CAME UP WITH, RIGHT???!!?10) Superstars songs just trail off. Yeah, WWF ATTITUDE, again how old is that???, let you actually listen to the whole song in create a player. Here I listen to my characters music after he wins and it just stops mid way in the song...LAME!11) Legends don't even come out to their music.??? WHY???12) OMG SO MUCH BUTTON MASHING. Seriously, my wrists still hurt. There is just so much button mashing. Button mashing was invented by lazy game developers. Instead of putting in real ways to get out of holds. TAP ANY BUTTON AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. So yeah, eventually you get carpral tunnel syndrome. THANKS GUYS!!!13) Taunting does nothing!!! Remember in the n64 games where at least your attitude meter went up??? NOT HERE!!! NOTHING!!!Yeah, so I think that's about it. I was just totally let down by this game in nearly every sense, and I seriously feel I got ripped off for the $5 I paid for this used. Everything was just so lame and seemed broken almost. To put it mildy, TNA IMPACT is a better game than this...and way more fun, too. I thought I was going to get a sense of nostalgia from when I used to love wrestling, but this only helped confirm what I already knew, WWE was getting lame and stupid around then. Thanks for help ruin the few good memories from back then with this atrocity of a game, guys!!!THE PRO's??? I got to be in a relationship with Sable for a bit without being Brock Lesnar. So that was cool. And since I bought this used, Vince and co. didn't get financial gain from my purchase. TAKE THAT PG WRESTLING COMPANY!!!BOTTOM LINE: NO MERCY 64 (OR ANY N64 WRESTLING GAME MADE BY AKI, LIKE VIRTUAL PRO WRESTLING AND VIRTUAL PRO WRESTLING 2) is still the best wrestling game ever made. If you want a newer wrestling game that isn't ugly and is actual fun to play once you get the controls down, go with DAY OF RECKONING for the GC. The 2nd DAy of RECKONING is pretty good, too. But stay, away from RAW And RAW 2 for the XBOX. Those last 2 were complete garbage, except for the stars that were on the roster in that game. THANKS FOR READING AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER!!!\n",
      "The game is not cool it is not callngin like the odd parnts game bay that.\n",
      "I don't really like this game because all you do is fight.\n",
      ".How can this be a 5 star game. No way! It's stupid!! I've had it for 2 days and i'm already getting bored of it. The movies are ok, but the game play is boring, and most of the jokes are really corny. Spend your money on a different game, seriously.\n",
      "I just got the \"Xbox 360\" and I didn't know that many \"Xbox\" games don't play on the \"Xbox 360\".  Well this is one of them.  Now I know for the future that when buying \"Xbox\" games to read all the one star reviews to make sure they can play on \"Xbox 360\" first.  I have most of these games on Playstation 2.  Now I know to hold onto my Playstation 2 for all of these old games.\n",
      "This game reezeed a lot. And it is vary hard to play.This is a big dissapontmit.\n",
      "the thing is,Disney and Nickelodeon suck at making video-games!they're perfect at cartoons and movies,but absolutley suck at video games!!!! Its an abomination to video games!!!(just trying to be dramatic.)and this is probably the worst of them all!!!!whatever you do,STAY AWAY FROM DISNEY AND NICKEODEON GAMES!!!!sincerly,kenny\n",
      "I waited with baited breath for this game. Lucasarts and Planet Moon Studios, who gave us the wonderfully original and funny Giants: Citizen Kabuto working together! It should be great right? Well, in essence, no. The best part of the game are the hilarious cut scenes that introduce the characters. These are very well written and laugh out loud funny. The game play is uninspired. Sure, you get to use the infamous land shark gun and the &quot;corkscrew&quot; weapon to literally turn the world upside down, but you get to use these power ups few and far in between. Most of the time you will be using your trusted machine gun to mow down endless waves of mooks. The game is extremely uninspired and gets repetitive within 5 minutes. I would rather buy a DVD with the cut scenes from the game than pay $50 for this game. Sorry, but it just falls well short.\n",
      "Although I am not a fan of DOA's, Virtua Fighter's, Tekken's, and other \"modern fighting games'\" play mechanics, I was actually considering buying this game. I'm glad I rented it instead.This was supposed to be a remake of both Dead Or Alive 1 and 2 with upgrades. Instead, Dead or Alive Ultimate ends up as just another port. Sure it has extra outfits and stages and online play for those who can afford the excruciating monthly broaband fees, but it fixes none of the information problems in training mode, the characters are hard to control, and the optional English Language Dialogue that was in DoA 2 Hardcore for the PlayStation 2 has been stripped from the X-Box version.As for the Dead or Alive series in general, if I want confusing combo moves, I'll play one of those stupid dancing games. I hope this isn't the future of fighting games and that \"Street Fighter\" gameplay will come back again.\n",
      "I've played all of the Dead or Alive games and found that they lack everything but boobs and girls. Sure there are guy ninjas like the awsome Hybusha but that's really the only reason I kept the game. Sure I like girls, but come on, i buy a fighting game to play a fighting game. Oh about the fighting physics they suck. You can about counter every freakin move. I used Hybusha for a few days and I beat a Super rank gamer on DOA online, how pathetic. The graphics are all that seemed to please the eyes except for B-factor. Anyways When it comes down to it, matrial art fighting is way better than this, To me this is  horrible tekken clone that diserves to be put down for good, DOA 4, a clone of this game with more characters, whooo who cares. Anyways if your looking for a awsome fighting game pick up the best, Soul Caliber II or if you like Tekken buy Tekken 5, but please save yourself the money and dignity skip this one...\n",
      "Does anyone besides me see a problem here? I am a huge DDR fan and have been for years. I was so excited when I heard Karaoke Revolution was coming out. After all, how could it be bad with all that cool Bemani music? Well, I was wrong about a few things there. First of all, NONE of the music is Bemani, which means no more cool DDR music. I had assumed that DDR-inspired songs might be included, or at least some cool JRock/Jpop/Europop! Maybe even the Smile.dk songs that have been constantly excluded from the American DDR games could have been included. That was the second thing wrong with this game. All it is is terrible American popular music, and that disappointed me highly. I personally can't stand Michelle Branch or any of those whiny untalented American pop artists. This game is marketed to the American masses, not the true DDR fan. I'm sure the gameplay itself is a lot of fun if you ignore the songlist. If you love DDR, don't buy this game. If you love popular American radio music, be my guest.\n",
      "I saw this game and thought it might be fun, as I enjoy games like Ghost Recon; however, I was very disappointed.  There is not much you can do with this game unless you have X Box Live.  The single player missions are pretty boring and you will get tired of them within the first 15 minutes or so.  I don't have X Box Live, so I can not comment on the game play online.Pros:  None that I could see.  There are better first person  shooters out there.Cons:  Lack of game play offline.  Graphics were not the best and the IA was not very intelligent.Overall:  Try Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, or some of the other Tom Clancy 1st Person shooters.\n",
      "this version the controls are akward and hard too use. worst graphics ever seen on xbox, they should have left this alone and on the pc only, nice attempt but falls short of the original.\n",
      "don't buy this , buggy , you spend more time loading the game and crashing it than completing a level, soo many buggy pc games out therecheers good luck! if you buy it\n",
      "This game, which claims to be the &quot;spiritual sucessor to X-Com&quot;, disgraces the entire genre of squad-based strategy games.  Why? The interface is arkward and counterintuitive.  The player has to plot &quot;waypoints&quot; in order for team members to move.  Why?  Do you plot waypoints before you move?The game sacrafices plot for graphics.  X-Com UFO Defense (which arguably had lame graphics by today's standards) was thouroughly engaging plotwise.  You wanted to win the missons even if, for nothing else, to see what would happen next on the tech-tree.  Also, there was a certain uniqueness to each member of your squad that made you kind of &quot;attatched&quot;.  Here, you are expected to be so awestruck by the flashy graphics and 3-D acceleration that you can overlook the substance of the storyline and characters.  In fact, the storyline is quite boring compared to the original x-com.Still, for me, one reason stands out among the rest.  The FONT!  What is wrong with computer game programmers nowadays.  Do they think that people want to play computer games with magnifying glasses?  I had to sit one foot away from my screen to go the tutorial.  The game is guaranteed to cause migraines!  I have noticed that this has become a trend with modern PC games, although I really don't know why.  Sure, I know it sounds knit-picky, but the overall effect is that it makes the unenjoyable games even less enjoyable.\n",
      "I have never been able to get this controller to work with any game I have.  It won't work with DuckTales Remastered, it won't work with Dust, it won't work with GTA: San Andreas (and I was really hoping I could use it for the flying parts), it won't work with Star Raiders.  It was a complete and utter waste of money.\n",
      "Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!\n",
      "I want to make this review rather short. First, it's an easy to install Gamepad and looks very promising. You have the easy PS2 feel, dual-analog control pads, and a comfortable fit. You can install the drivers or not. It doesn't really make a difference because Windows will recognize it.The problem with this Gamepad is that it is not very durable. I bought and tested this controller with MVP Baseball 2005 & Need for Speed Underground 2. What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.There are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one.Be aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it. The GamePad is useless. I would suggest you go with Nyko's AirFlo Gamepad instead. I've had no problems with that one.\n",
      "This gamepad is great - if it worked.Just like ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS have described, my Left Analog stick is no longer functioning properly.  It will not respond when moving it to the right.  I have only had the controller for about 2+ weeks, and I am far from a heavy gamepad user.These controllers should obviously be recalled.UPDATE:  I have been able to recalibrate the controller by unplugging it from the USB connector on my PC.  I have to do this daily.  NOT GOOD.UPDATE2:  I bought a new controller (and returned the old one), and so far after about 4 weeks, no more calibration problems.  Maybe they got the problem fixed?  If the calibration problem stays away, I would give this 4+ stars.\n",
      "My bf (who worked at a Gamestop) bought me one of these pads on his discount. We went to his place and tried it out on his computer. It started out looking like a decent replacement for my Saitek, it had the \"Key-Mapping\" menu and very customizable. But I spent a good hour trying to make a profile for it to fit my SNES emulator. After getting that done I finally tried it out with a game I knew had diagonal in it: Secret of Mana.The overly recessed D-pad sucked, big time. When I wanted to go diagonal it wanted to go up, down, left or right. Saitek P880's have some of the same problem, but not as badly. I like Logitech and Saitek's layouts and programmability but jeeeze, you guys gotta learn to make better D-pads. Either go with what's tried and true (snes 'cross') or make a flat touch sensitive pad (Triax's Turbo Touch 360)And I've heard about those adapters that allow PS2 and Super Nintendo pads to be run on USB. My roomate says that can actually tear up pads because they don't recieve the correct voltage. I shouldn't HAVE TO do something like that. Companies should make better, more durable d-pads. The majority of people buying your pads are emu-geeks looking for a way to play Sega emulators without having to use their keyboards.\n",
      "This game is not what you think it is. I thought this game would be like Socom but sadly...its not. Its more of a strategy click and drag, you sit back and watch all the action type of game. So many control issues and it has a slight learning curve you need to adapt to but by then your dead. Graphics are ok.\n",
      "Well, I must say that I am extremely disappointed with FSW in many respects.  For one, the graphics are not exactly anything to rave about. They are ok, but that's about it.  And after all the hype this game received and the advertising it put out, it seems they should have saved some money for the developing.  Basically, the actuall gameplay is at a 4 year old level.  Click here, move there. THAT'S ALL YOU DO. And I can't stand the cheesey jargon used in the voiceovers. Horrible! I am an infantryman in the US Army, and I can tell you, no one I know talks like this or uses the goofy lingo the throw around in this game. Also,there is NO open ended gameplay, you can only move to certain areas on the map. The enemy AI and the weapons physics are ridiculous.  You can have your team fire at an enemy out in the open and he wont move, wont throw a frag, wont call in support etc. If you want a REAL war simulation, buy Operation Flashpoint.  It's dated, but still THE best squad/fps/command game ever made.  After all the patches and upgrades and addons and it's truly open ended gameplay,  OFP will probably be the only game that will permanently stay on my hard drive. FSW, nice try, no cigar.\n",
      "Bad graphics, bad sound, not in anyway fun. To hard. This game is stressful, just like real life and I don't want to sit down and waste my time at this. You can't keep yourself happy and do all the other things in the short amount of time you get. In the games time, it takes him an hour and a half to eat, half hour to go to the bathroom, he needs to sleep for at least nine hours and need to be happy, clean, likes the house, is relaxed, and is social staduis is good. In the later levels you have to on top of that help run a gym and help people and stuff\n",
      "This game isn't any better than the sims i own both games and the only thing thats differnt from the sims and the sims busten out is the story line and that you watch you drive your vehicle i men how gay is that?I mean i don't know why they called this game sims bustin out i mean i dont even know why they wasted there time makeing this one.I sugest if you want to start with sims wait and get the sims 2.\n",
      "The Sims Bustin Out is a really really boring game. It is the same thing as every other sims game but you are in different places. All you do is control someones life. Dont buy it. It is a waste of monney.\n",
      "What a bad game! It stinks! The create a sims is half way decent...but it still stinks. Controls stink, furniture stinks, graphics are decent.IF YOU WANT FUN BUY SIMS 2 FOR THE PC!!!\n",
      "I didn't realize this old X Box game wouldn't work on the 360 so I sold to a local video game store.\n",
      "Im a Standard/heavy kid that plays in arcades, well, alot of my cousins and friends have these pads, and they are totally screwed up.  I was playing, and I was changing my level to make it on heavy(Press down twice) and it made it to Light mode instead of Heavy!  I suggest you buy stiff pads by the RedOctane company where they use stiff pads.  And also with these pads, it is hard to use for an arcade player, because the down arrow is farther down than the matal pads on the arcade versions.  And maybe, if you are a freestylist (trickmaster) Try puttion something behind the pad so you have a balance bar and something to do tricks with.Then I did Healing Vision, which I can get a AA on, and I got a D!!!  I found a site where you can make a homemade metal pad, but I forgot the site, and it costs $129 for the materials.  For a DDR freak, all this stuff is worth it.Remember, play in Bemanai arcades and other places with Arcade DDR for good Luck, console versions might be messed up by weird song sets, horrible pads, and those annoying characters dancing in the backround!  Note: DDR Max 1 and 2 are very good, the rest aren't especially DDR Extreme.\n",
      "The pad slides when you start doing the Standard levels and need to move your feet faster.These buttons seem to loose their sensitivity after awhile. grr.My boyfriend has big feet--- and he's always pressing multiple buttons at once on accident....\n",
      "What is it with game designers?  You come up with a good concept, which in this case has spawned an impressive game dynasty whose first three games were absolute classics, and then you screw it up.This game, luckily, doesn't try to be a 1st-person shooter; I haven't found a single good 1st-person shooter on the Game Boy Advance and am convinced that the GBA simply doesn't have the response and accuracy of controls necessary for games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, No One Lives Forever...or Medal of Honor.  It retains the excellent Michael Giacchino score which had distinguished this game series from the pack.  And the World War II locations and weapons remain accurate.  So what's the problem?  The level design, for one thing.  It made precious little sense to me why they would have two fairly player-friendly missions of low difficulty, allowing you to feel out the game, and then launch you into a multi-tier mission where you have to kill about 30 enemies back to back without being able to save.  Difficulty is a necessary part of any game, but this is just ridiculous -- so you survived an onslaught of 40 enemies?  How about we take away any ammo replenishments and send four bombers your way that can attack you behind barriers and kill on contact?  This game also has a hyper-annoying map system where you could take one step into an area and the game \"seals off\" your escape route so that you may find yourself suddenly cornered.  It makes no sense realistically speaking, and it certain does nothing except to frustrate your gameplay.The weapon aiming system is very poor.  Why would they veer your shots to the right?  To be more \"realistic\" because your soldier is right-handed?  This makes diagonal shots very difficult.  Also, your shots don't go straight -- they spray sideways, maybe in an emulation of gun recoil, but that's like saying to the player:  \"You can aim, but not really.\"  Your enemies don't mind -- they have unlimited ammo, and they come in groups.  Having to charge towards your enemy a step just to shift your aim is already annoying, but this \"right-hand bias\" is just dumb.  And the minute an enemy shot hits you, you bounce back and lose control of your character...but you remain vulnerable to attack and so can lose your entire life from just one bullet hit.  Ridiculous.Somehow no Electronic Arts game I've played on the GBA has been without fundamental annoyances like these, and it's getting just tiresome.  I *was* going to give this game two stars, but after having played one level 30 times with the same result of being killed by flights of bombers, I simply said \"*&^% this\".  I'll bet the ... game developers had a wonderful time devising ways to kill off the player with hordes of enemies.  Well, this is the last Electronic Arts game I guy, and this game is going straight to a second-hand store.\n",
      "this game was insanely hard i couldn't even beat the first level. its the only game i own that i havn't beaton\n",
      "The previous versions of this game we're A LOT more exciting! This one almost put me to sleep! The music isn't anything great, and where's the action? Not in here. Sorry, but they could have made a far better game than this! Congratulations I say to the gaming developers-You finally made a sequel to a game that sucks!\n",
      "The only thing that relates this rotten game to &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; is the name.  Everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game.  The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous.The ring menu system from &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker.Another minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains.I doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown &amp; Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.  They pulled the same dirty trick with &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; which was an okay game developed by Capcom, but it was not as good as a Square game.If they couldn't be bothered to do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all.\n",
      "Ther'es one specifc reason I don't like this game. Once you get to the final dungeon (the game is kind of like the legend of zelda) it locks you out and you can never go back!! If there's ever a game without any replay value, no matter how good, I would never get it...That's why I'm always cautious when buying my games, unless, of course, it's a puzzle game, etc. not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game. The last thing I have to say about this game is I got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door (read my review) but instead it doesent save at all once you're done beating the game! You're still in that damn final DUNGEON!!! Sadly, I might give this game a good rating IF it had replay value...Get this game if you don't care about replay value... ):\n",
      "Well, it's not Secret of Mana.  It's not even Children of Mana.  It's a totally different beast of a game.  I tried on two separate occasions to get into this game, but one single thing turned me off:  time actually passes during the day.Remember The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask?  Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time?  Yeah, I HATE that.  And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.So in reality, I can't give you a true game review.  I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done.  If you can handle that, however, this may be the game for you.Not recommended for anyone.  Epic fail.\n",
      "It wasn't what I expected. I thought I could be the SIM and not just look down on the city. Shouldve known since so cheap...smh\n",
      "My game came without the product code required for activation. Apparently this is a well-known problem. I suggest you avoid this game until the problem is fixed, or pruchase it at a retail location where you can open the box to confirm that an activation code is present.\n",
      "Horrible game. Not anything like the originals. Ea has horrible service. Thank You Amazon for the refund! I hope ea goes out of.business for ruining another great franchise.\n",
      "I found the art work, the inability to get in close, and the intensity of graphics (which eventually crashed my XP Home Edition computer) not anywhere near as appealing as SimCity 3000. I would never bother to buy a good video card just for this game.\n",
      "This game is terrible. I love the old Sim City games, especially 3000. They obviously put a lot of effort into the graphics on this one and they are very good, but the game is a train wreck. They should have stuck to the old engine, but beefed up the amount of things you can do. They should have just added more and more detail, more buildings, more control over city functions, control over climate (global location) when building terrains, more detail in running a city, and then some better graphics. Being able to build cities in arctic surroundings or deserts would be neat. But no, they have to make it so convoluted that just getting started makes you want to scream. Some of the things they added are OK ideas, but it's such a bad game that none of that matters. I found building starting terrains to be an extremely long process in this one. I could have definitely done without the driving around saving the day and using helicopters to fight crime. That whole aspect really seems to belong in some other game. I know that some people may like it, but I think they should have focused on what has made the series what it is. It's only my opinion, but this game gives me a headache just thinking about it and compared to it's predecessors it's a joke. It's like they tried to jazz it up way too much. Isn't part of the reason these games have sold in the past been because people like to just build away? It doesn't need to be slowly morphed into grand theft auto in order to improve it. Definitely the worst of the series that I've ever played. The old Dos version beats this one hands down.\n",
      "I remember playing this game when it first came out.  I loved it.  for some reason, I cant seem to get this version going.Its just not as easy as I remember.  don't like this version at all.  Very disappointing.\n",
      "We bought this game for our son, who has an affinity for these types of hack-and-slash games, only to discover that the game won't run.  This is a brand new computer, with more than plenty of hard drive space &amp; RAM to spare, with a 64mb graphics card.  Unfortunately, there are only TWO graphics cards that this game will recognize.  You can have the most powerful card in the world, and if it isn't NVIDIA or ATI Radeon, you are out of luck.Do we want to blow $100-$150 installing a new graphics card, all for the sake of one lousy game, especially one that has gotten the mixed reviews that this game has?  I really don't think so.  We have never had any problems with any other programs we have installed on this system.  The idea that I need to drag a brand new computer back in for an upgrade just strikes me as ridiculous.  This game's designers need to be more flexible when configuring the system requirements.Our son never got to play this game, but I know that he would have been driven crazy by the lack of a quick-save feature.  Once again, the game's designers display a profound lack of flexibility.  They must live in some fantasy world where people have all day to kill, slogging through an entire level before being able to save the game.  Get real folks.We have a couple of other EA games, and I have generally been lukewarm about what are obviously console games that have been reconfigured for a PC in a sometimes slap-dash manner.  This most recent, very disappointing experience leaves me extremely reluctant to purchase any EA products in the future.\n",
      "I won't get into a battle with words here. Let me kep it simple.PC GAMER magazine gave this game a rating of 58% out of 100%. That is bad!!!Let me quote some lines from their review in the January 2004 issue.\" Frustrating camera controls, not enough diversity in character play styles, disappointing failure, stupidly difficult\"Need anyone say anything more? Don't listen to the reviews that gave this high marks. They are LOTR extremists - the same guys that go to Star Trek conventions all dressed up like Kirk or Picard!!!First of all, most of the guys that gave this game 5 stars wrote reviews before the game was even released!!!! Second, most of them admit they have not even played the game!!! They just love LOTR. Ok..so do I, but don't go suckering some people into blowing their hard earned dollars...Are the graphics good in this game...YES. They are truly outstanding and unbelievable!! That is all the nice things I have to say about this game.The game play is terrible. You have to fight in 360 degrees which means that the enemies are between you and your guy. You cannot even see what your doing!!! Oh by the way, you cannot quick save. You can only save at the end of the level! Generally this is fine by me, but since this game is so hard and camera angles constantly make your life miserable....you absolutely need to be able to Quick Save!!!!THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING OF ALL - THE CUT-SCENES!!!!!!ELECTRONIC ARTS force you to watch all the cut-scenes. NO SKIPPING THEM!!!! And some of them are over 5 minutes long!Here is how the game starts - You have to go through all the production credits from EA Games, among others...get through the horrible THX ear blowing intro and about 3 other stupid intros...then the first cut scene happens - this one alone is about 5 minutes of scenes from the last movie. Then you get dumped into the game in the ehat of battle. Talk about confusing as all heck!Guess what...if you screw up the game or just want to start over...you have to sit through the credits and all of the games cut scenes all over again!!!!!! NO CHOICE!!!!!!!!Thanks a lot EA GAMES!!! You milked the MOH franchise to death and ruined what could have been great and now you are just out to milk money from the LOTR saga.I played this game through all the way. I normally would want to play a game all over again. Not this time!!!!!!!Borrow a copy from a friend or at the very least, download them demo and try it out before you buy!!!!!!!!!!Hey if you don't believe me...read the comments in some of the LOTR game forums out there! MANY, MANY other people that own this game will agree with me 100%!!!Send EAGAMES  a message, send them some e-mail and tell them to allow skipping past cut scenes, send them a message and skip this game.Trust me, your money is better spent else where...Get Halo, GTA:Vice City, Medal of Honor, or BloodRayne which is a blast and sells for less.\n",
      "If you like to fool around with boring games this is for you. The game sucks. It has horrible graphics and it is too hard to drive the slow goofy looking cars. It is a horrible game and it is not worth a penny.\n",
      "Age of Mythology, the original, is a great game. The campaign is fun. The random map games are great.The animation is stunning. The monsters and units are well thought out. I would DEFINITELY suggest the original.**HOWEVER** I feel this expansion pack was not worth the money at all. I played with it installed for about a half hour (and used cheat codes to investigate all the new things) and then promply uninstalled and sold it. The ONLY fun part about it was actually getting the titans, but the atlantians are pitiful in the sense of buildings and units. I was very disappointed in it.If you feel like trying it, go ahead. But I would not suggest buying it.\n",
      "I did not follow everyone else advice and went ahead and bought it.  Don't do it!  It's boring, slow, and not very exciting.  It takes a long time to even get playing and is very difficult to figure the game out.  Also the camera angels although they do allow you to rotate now are still not very helpful.\n",
      "This game is boring enough to fall asleep and never turn it back on. I found it very monotonous.\n",
      "After all the hype about how great the game was, the reality was such a disappointment. The graphics were fine, but the colors were very drab and not crisp enough to convey anything unique. The hardest thing was that I actually found myself bored halfway through the game....you have to waste your time going back and forth to places with no reason to be there just to get information to get further in the game. The characters were boring, there were tons of unuseable items that were a distraction. And after all the time you waste, the ending is the biggest let down. They should have just wrote on the final screen &quot;thanks for your money sucker&quot;. Just like with movies that have really bad endings, I have even less appreciation and respect for games like this that stink due to the fact that you have to work harder to get to the end.Unless you have the time to waste on this sleeper, I would save your money.\n",
      "This game has a protection called starforce. Starforce can cause your computer to mess up and also. By the lawsuit that is hanging in cort right now damage to your computer system and cd/dvd drive.\n",
      "Ok for all the retards that think you can add a NOS, and Turbo and all the other stuff you can &quot;add&quot; to your car into a Neon, OR a skyline and have them race with similar speed, you're really retarded.  This game has two things going for it, tight gameplay, slick graphics.  Once you get to the last few races, the expert races you'll notice that you're extremely fast car can do extremely fast flips when it hits the slightest environment article.  For example you can slice your car through some stop signs and trees, and then later in the game you'll be going 170 and then wham, straight to ZERO because you hit the wrong road cone, or tree. Even better the computer racers can glance off cars and not miss a beat, whilst you graze a car and you flip uncontrollably into other invisibly cemented objects.  This game is very frustrating I've destroyed a handful of controllers in the attempt to beat the whole thing.  All in all this game is not as challenging as a gran turismo game but it's easy playability is stomped to death by a plague of problems that makes playing it much less fun than harnessing a true NFS game like the beautiful Hot Pursuit 2 game.  but sorry kiddies in NFS: Hot Pursuit 2 you can't put crap all over your stupid civic and make it beat a skyline.\n",
      "Remember that movie The fast and the furious.....Well think of that movie fused into a game and just as idiotic. This game is the lamest excuse for a racing game ever. I am the biggest NFS fan but this hits the all time low. It is surprising Electronic Arts could have ever thought up something this stupid. I was excited when the game first came out until realizing that it was nothing more then a cheap offshoot of lame racing films. The customizablity takes over the concept of the real racing and destroys the purpose of buying the game. Hey how about you buy a $50 game so you can customize cars all day...If I ever wanted to do that I would go work in a garage. Nevertheless I must give props to the graphics. Though nothing compared to Gran Truismo it hit the low time standards of PS2 racers. But if you are planing to buy a great racing game with customizable features and fun racing time DONT buy this game cause thats not what your going to get. Instead settle for a 2d nintendo racer cause this game really is all cut out for playing material.\n",
      "What a fun game this may have been if it actually was able to play, Sadly this was a dud & would not play, so I got issued a refund & tossed the disc. I would not order from seller again!\n",
      "It is an EXACT copy of Medal of Honor Allied Assault and the expansion packs that followed. Don't waste your money.They didn't even try to make it orginial. It is just the same old, scripted mission action repackaged.I enjoyed the game. I liked it...but I did not think it was worth my money.There are some new things that are nice...but that list is so short, it is still not worth $40 or $50!!!DON&quot;T BELIEVE THE HYPE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Download the demo or borrow a copy from a friend and TEST DRIVE it first people.If you like it...then buy it but don't rush out because of the overhyped 5 star votes in here!!!\n",
      "worst game ever, it ignore me every time I try to run thre game, it just appear the loading screen and then it dissipear, i try it again but it wont work. u like WWII games go buy medal of honor allied assault, it has better graphics, fun, way better then this stragity game. but if u like stragity game go buy starcraft best stragity game i ever play.\n",
      "I must say I HATE the controller S.  It is way too small and the button layout is confusing.  It feels cheap and fragile as well.  I played on one in a video store and I could barely play the game.  I will never buy one of these controllers, I will keep my original controllers.  If I ever need replacement XBOX controllers I will just go to Ebay and get the first ones that came out with the XBOX.\n",
      "This game is just race and get new cars. One of the most boring games ever. Flashy cars, great graphics, but no interesting features what so ever. I have Project Gotham 1 and 2. I got bored of them after 2 days. Take my advice, theres better games out there! Later.\n",
      "My only experience with this product was after I opened it, and started to play a DVD in my Xbox, when I tried to pause it, it didn't work, and it had brand new batteries. I found (after much frustration) that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes. I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit, but it was sold out so I just got my money back. You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs.\n",
      "Went and bought this for Xmas. Worked fine, then the next week, \"Disc Read Error\"? WTH?!!. Even though I read about this from other owners, I decided to take a chance. Never again. People poke fun at the older sytems, but my Playstation 1 has never, ever failed me, and I almost traded it in for this crap. My other older systems, such as the SNES, Genesis and N64 have performed well without any problems. I took this back and will stick with the ol' skool systems. But then again, I guess I'm not a \"real\" gamer until I own an XBOX or PS2, right? As for the reviewer who told the guy to get a brain because he said playstation 1 was better, why don't YOU get a life. People have their own preferences in what they like.\n",
      "PS2 has got to be the worst game system out of gamecube and X-box. X-box is NUMBER 1 if you want a game system get a X-box. here are some reasons.1. an X-box has a gigantic hardrivePS2 you need to buy a expensive memory card2. the graphics are so much better on the X-box.3. X-box DVD is so much better than PS24. you need to wait so long for PS2 games to loadits so much faster with X-box5. when ever X-box comes out with a great game PS2 tries to make it for its consol.I could go on forever with this list...... so get an X-box becuase its worth the money!\n",
      "THis system is a piece of junk. It freezes a lot. ALso, the memory on mine corrupted after only 1 YEAR! Thats nothing. You have to also buy a memory card unlike xbox. Oh yeah, and i forgot.LOADING.........LOADINGLOADINGLOADINGLOADINGSTILL LOADING...You get my point. I played soul calibur on ps2 and on xbox. Their both the same, by the way, Heihachi sucks!, and ps2 took three times longer to load. Arrrrrrrgggggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "PS2 CONSOLE IT LOADS THE GAMES TO SLOW WILL NOT PLAY ALLOF MY PS2 GAMES HARD TOO SHIP BACK I LIKE TOO PLAY MY GAMES THAT I CAN PLAY WOULD NOT TELL ANY ONE TOO BUY FROM THEM NOR WOULD I TELLNOT TOO BUY\n",

      "you like games take my word for it all of sony is junk.buy a x box or gamecube\n",
      "Hey guys if you are even considering the PS2, don't do it. Don't even think about it. The PS2 sucks so bad it's not even funny. It would be great if it were portable, but it's supposed to be a home console! Here I'll give you a list of things that a home console should have but the PS2 doesn't -=It should have really fun games.=Good multiplayer capabilities.=Great graphics.=Cheap acessories.The ps2 does none of these. And here's something else - DVD incompatibility. I looked it up and it seems there are about 150 popular dvds that the ps2 for some reason won't play at all!!! 150!! And here's the killer - 30 that won't work on XBox. Only thirty!! And that problem with the stupid thing overheating. One person claimed that he was even able to play for a whole hour without out it heating up! OOh a whole hour. Well guess what I played Halo on Xbox with my friends for an all nighter (12 hours straight without turning it off) and when we did decide to call it quits, I felt the xbox and it wasn't even warm.BEAT THAT YOU STUPID POS2!!!\n",
      "Thanks for knocking the ever so creative Sega Dreamcast out of the water, Sony. You could have at least given us something good and not a clunky black box with DVD playback. You could have at least offered an online service like Xbox. You could have at least produced an outstanding library like on Gamecube. But no. You just have to scare Dreamcast away, crush Gamecube, and fight with Xbox. I have no idea how you do that with such an ugly mess that groans and never works. I hate you Sony.\n",
      "Bottom line is game cube and xbox are better. 1 xbox may not come with a dvd player but I have a tip for all you xbox lovers. Go to the internet type in xbox mod chip. you can either get the mod chip and put it in yourself, or get it already put in! The mod chip: -gives you an automatic dvd player (using xbox controller)allows you to play copied games (copy games with whats called a DVD re-writable c-d )(there just a bunch of special blank c-ds you use)-Gives you a whole new menu.-is a complete step closer to being a cpu-Your start up screen will be blue not green so dont be alarmed-DO not drop xbox with mod chip in. will knock out of slot slightly and screw up-no worries, we have 5 ppl in our family  (3 kids). me my sis and my little monster bro (JK) and our xbox is still in one piece-Plug in xbox and look through side. if you see a green light, it means all systems are ago. if its red its either busted (which never happens ^^ ) or its not quite on-should come with instructions-you can find it cheap on ebayWell I hope my tip gives you some insight or saves you a couple 100 hundered bucks heheheh.

      "The screen is half the size of my Game Boy Advance SP. It's a smaller screen than a cheap Palm device. Yet the unit itself needs about twice as much pocket space as a GBA-SP, so forget about slipping it in a shirt pocket; it's bigger than any phone on the market. The large size, odd shape and brightly colored buttons pretty much guarantee that you'll look a complete tool if you try to use it as a phone.As if that wasn't bad enough, the interface is complicated and confusing; don't expect to be able to pick it up and use it without reading the manual.For the price of an N-Gage you could get a refurb iPod, a t68i and a GBA-SP. Sure, three devices, but three devices that together take up about the same amount of space, while being much more suited to their respective tasks than this jack-of-all-trades.\n",
      "The Nokia N-Gage is a product that should not have been released. First of all, it tries to be everything to everyone but fails in the end. The games are mediocre (forgotten Playstation 1 ports) and the phone capabilities are subpar at best. I would also mention that the screen is oddly shaped for gaming and you have to literally take apart the entire back of the system (battery and all) to change games and THEN wait 2-3 minutes for it to boot up.In a nutshell, save your $300 and get a GameBoy Advance. It is tailored more towards gaming with a much greater library and everything from the system design to screen size is what a portable gamer needs.\n",
      "The system is flawed. This review is for the actual game system, get this. Do not buy the system for one huge problem, changing games. It is pretty complicated.You have to like remove the batteries, then insert something for sometime, then remove, then pretend to do something, then you scale a mountain, finally after a few key holds and such, you will win the nobel peace prize, and discover the start screen for your game.Honestly, Nokia there is something called the Game boy advance out. There is a really cool looking, and pretty small game boy sp, which everyone is happy with. Then there are 30 dollar phones that are twice as good as the n-gage. So lets bottom line it.Phone-30 bucks.Gameboy SP-70 bucks(Depending on where you get it, trade in your original gba and sometimes you can get rebates and such, i found a deal to get a new game boy advance sp for 50 bucks basically)That is like 100 bucks mabye, compared to the n-gage which is 300 dollars.I feel sorry for nokia though, they don't realize that noone is really intrested in their product. An awkward, expensive, and overall low-grade device is not worth so much money. If this phone was worth 30 bucks? Yea, tons of people would probably have it. It isn't though.Sorry Nokia, better luck next time.\n",
      "I'm starting to think this is the most laughable excuse for a video game system yet.  The Game Gear was pretty shoddy, the Jaguar was downright detestable.  But here's... THIS... for only a couple of c-notes, you get this amazing system, that's like a broken swiss army knife that has hundreds of different tools but seems to randomly burst open at inopportune times in your hand causing severe injury.  Yeah, it plays MP3'S, but buying this brings you already two-thirds of the way to the best MP3 player on the market.  Yeah, it's a cellphone, but there's so many more elegantly designed units that don't require you using a headjack to not look like a moron.  Yeah... erm, it plays games.  Erm, some games.  A-a few.  OK, they're ports of first-gen Playstation titles for the most part, and while that isn't wrong in itself (70% of the GBA's library is made of SNES ports or adaptations), it's all in the execution, and with poor control and the lousy aspect ratio, it's already gone belly up, not to mention these blocky 3D graphics are so much more painful on the eyes than something like, say, the nice smooth sprites of an Advance Wars.  And there are about 15 games in total, out of which only 2 or 3 are any good, and even then the fatal system flaws lead to them being well nigh unplayable.  Multiplayer is wireless and adequately implemented, but that's about the only plus, and there's only a couple of titles taking advantage of that, too.  After such a stupendous release as the GBA SP (perfection in design if there ever was any), such horrible design is inexcusable.  I know this is practically flogging a dead horse, but the message must be made loud and clear, lest a huge number of children become disappointed come Christmas.  Please, just say no.  Buy a GBA SP for half the price and get your kid a cellphone to accompany it with the remaining money (see, there's two of the functions the N-Gage has already!).  It's time that companies like this taking advantage of heedless customers with shoddy merchandise be stopped.  Disengage the N-Gage.\n",
      "Oh brother.After eagerly awaiting to see what the N-Gage will be like, I get my hands on one and find it to be a tremendous disappointment. Let me put it to you this way: everything negative you've read about in all those videogame magazines is true. This is a device that should be marketed to the cell phone crowd, not the videogamers. Essentially, it comes across as a Nokia phone wrapped around a fancy new package, right down to the obvious &quot;cell phone&quot; screen.It does several things, but unfortunately does none of them well. The games look great in presentation, but they are presented on a vertical (!!!) phone-style screen which is simply too small and produces too many headaches from eyestrain. The cartridge position is ridiculous, I hated having to perform surgery on the silly thing just to play a game. A strange idea, especially when you read Nokia's official explanation as to why the cartridge is &quot;buried&quot; inside the device which makes no sense. The menus and built-in management were both a mess. Talking on it is an issue all by itself: not only is it terrible to hear in public areas, but its downright embarrassing holding this electronic taco up to your ear! And who wants to splurge on a handset when the option to use it as a normal phone could have been made so much better?Few games are available for it, but that's common. That's not my beef. The problem is that the system itself is simply filled with too many design flaws. If Nokia (obviously a phone company) REALLY wants to create a GAME machine and then market it as a GAME machine, they should have gotten together with an outfit like Nintendo to help them design it for gamers in mind. It's pretty obvious that they had no idea what they were doing. I seriously believe this thing was rushed out the door for Christmas, but the fact the Nokia refused to listen to early consumer complaints about it at showings doesn't support that theory.Let me put it to you this way: I have a beautiful cell phone I adore (a Panasonic GU87), a minidisc player and a GBA. I'd rather have those three than this any day since I get far better performance and usage out of them as opposed to this thing. I took mind back and got a refund.The N-Gage is, unfortunately, a victim of its own design. Part phone, part videogame, part MP3 player, part radio, etc., it really doesn't fit or perform well in any of those categories.\n",
      "In addition the the previous writer's comments about the game system, I would like to add that the system also has to be held at an extraordinarily strange angle while using the actual phone. The &quot;gamepad&quot; design makes the buttons counter-intuitive to use as a phone and impractical to use as a gaming system. The screen is far too narrow for games to be displayed with any degree of useful information about surroundings, and given the numerous addon costs involving in making the system any more than a deficient gaming device, you could see from miles off that this piece of plastic-fantastic casual-glance garbage isn't worth your money.I'll keep my 3210 and my Game Boy Advance, thankyou very much, Nokia. If you're going to treat phone users with this amount of contempt in all future products, when the time comes to trade up I might buy an Ericsson or Motorola.\n",
      "Wish I hadn't wasted the money.First Glitch: Health and Mana viels could not be used. Reloaded and started the game at least ten times before finally deciding to try and venture on without.  Of course, it made for difficult and time consuming gameplay...running around circles during boss battles until my health replenished.Diehard that I am, I still managed to put HOURS into this shotty game and survived until reaching level two. That's when I found the SECOND glitch which made continuation impossible.Upon killing the Big Spider Boss, I decided to head back to unload my loot before entering the doors to level two.  Once done and \"saved\", I returned to the doors only to discover they were now CLOSED and I was unable to move forward without starting the entire game over again!After 12 hours of struggling to work around the games many unresolved errors, problems and glitches; the oh-so-boring 'hack and slash' gameplay was hardly worth the time... OR the money I spent.\n",
      "When I first heard about Sim City 2000 on the GBA, I thought dang that should be pretty sweet.  Then I realized that in actuality, the game would probably be pretty lousy due to the small screen and limits of the GBA. Still I decided to pick up a copy anyways but it wasn't worth the $20.As some have said, yes the game can be fun for a short period of time but then you'll most likely never get the urge to play it again. Doing some simple tasks in the game proves to be a bigger chore than in other versions and the cities you create feel empty and lifeless. However, if you've got lots of time on your hands and don't mind some of the neater additions of the pc versions missing along with some slowdown when disasters occur, then you will probably enjoy this game.\n",
      "If it says it will work in XP on the box then it should be PATCHED to work in XP whether you CAN play it or not.  If it says in the manual that four out of the five games are Win 98 only it should say that on the box.  I do not have this I would never buy it, but know for a fact that NS Porshe Unleashed and NS IV do NOT work in XP.  I do have those original titles.\n",
      "I followed the instructions by the book when I first purchased this product on installation and use. Everything seemed to be functioning normally, but when I start the game, there was no effect whatsoever. I went to the codejunkies website, read all the FAQ's on troubleshooting...nothing helped. So I exchanged this product for a new one, thinking it was defective. Same symptoms occurred. So I contacted both UK and US support. Neither side could help. They just kept repeating the instructions mentioned in the Instruction booklet, wasting my time. Eventually, I threw a question at them that seemed to have boggled their minds. I asked them if early PS2 consoles produced in 2000 don't work with their product. Both sides say they cannot be certain, but there is a possibility since they did design the product based on a later produced PS2 console. The funny thing is, UK support asked me to contact SCEA to see if there was any hardware changes made in the PS2 production over the years. Why waste my time? I just returned this product. My recommendation is to purchase this product at a store that guarantees returns so you can test it on your console and return it without any hassle if it doesn't work. I purchased my PS2 back in early 2000 and AR MAX doesn't work on it. Whether it's because AR MAX isn't compatible with early PS2's or AR MAX is a terrible product, I cannot say for sure with the facts I've collected. Purchase at your own risk!\n",
      "Then this will not work on your console.But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console.If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark.\n",
      "This game is an example of what not to do! The graphics are poor; the environments are almost as blocky &amp; pixilated as Super Mario brothers. All of the natural foliage is totally devoid of detail. The A.I. is sub-par at best as the enemies react to shooting only part of the time. Hit detection is also poor, as one shot in the mid section can bring enemies down while other's miss their mark completely. Weapon selection is severely limited as you can only pick from two primary weapons and either have a hand gun OR grenades. To offset the poor weapon selection, Ubisoft made all of the weapons fire at a full auto rate, even the M16. The full auto weapons will really tick a lot of people off, especially the people who actually know what the real life counter parts are capable of and what they are not capable of.  With all of the GREAT shooters out, game designer's really need to make the games look and feel real to compete, and this one just does not have what it takes. The missions could have been great but, the poor environment detail and overall reality just cannot be overlooked. I had this game on pre-order and wish that I had waited to purchase it until after all of the reviews came out. While people will compare it to SOCOM II, that simply is not fair to Ghost Recon. Ghost Recon is merely an idea or concept of what a great shooter should be. IF, Ubisoft plans to compete in the very tough market of shooter's, they need to take a long, hard look at the other titles and take plenty of notes. OVERALL RATING: POOR! I would advise renting first if you are a die hard fan\n",
      "I usually enjoy Majesco games. I like Bloodrayne and Advent Rising because they were both pretty cool games. But Majesco has a habit of releasing games a little too early, leaving them a bit undercooked around the edges. However, when it comes to Drake, this game feels like it wasn't even put in an oven. This game is a terrible glitchy mess, that will make you want to throw your controller at the TV screen. This game is so bad it doesn't even deserve to be in the bargain bin, instead it's like you grabbed a game from Satan's game library.WHAT THE GAME IS: A terrible third-person shooter. An artifact has been stolen from the temple of the 99 Dragons, and Drake's master has been killed. So he must go out, get the artifact, and kill all who stand in his way. The story is so poorly told within the game you will never be able to take it seriously, ever.GRAPHICS: I've always loved the comic book look in games. Like the awesome FPS XIII (PS2, Xbox, GC). This game has a nice look, but WHY THE F*** DON'T THE LIPS MOVE WHEN THEY TALK DAMMIT?! The level designs and enemy designs are okay, but seriously, what the hell happened when designing the protagonist Drake? He looks like the offspring of Frankenstein and a zombie because he looks like a walking corpse.MUSIC: This music is awful, it has no purpose in even existing.SOUNDS: Whenever this tool opens his mouth, he can't more than two seconds without sounding like a complete jackass. There's shooting, crappy voice-acting (Why does a guy who looks like a Yakuza mobster sound like he came from Alabama?), and the sounds of your character dying that wasn't even your fault.GAMEPLAY: \"Death is only the beginning,\" as one of the talking statues in the world you go when you die says to you. Apparently she's warning you that this game not only has a problem of constant cheap deaths that await you, but it has some of the most God-awful challenges ever put in a shooter and that you have wasted your money. The shooting mechanics wouldn't have been passable a decade ago... and beyond that! There is no reticle onscreen, so all you can do is try and guess where your shots go and shoot uncontrollably with a total disregard for tactics. Climbing up walls is a terrible mess and it doesn't work all that well. This game also steals the slow-mo shooting feature from the great third-person shooter Max Payne, and does an awful job of implementing it here. And for just about every stage you're timed on them. Your health depletes quickly as well, and I can't tell you how many times I went from high health points to death in about five seconds or less. This game provides no fun challenges of any kind for you, and cheap deaths and a wish to break the disc is all that you get. Other instances of cheap I recall were things like pursuit missions in which I got hit by several vehicles that randomly appeared on the street, and another time was when I entered a room and got mauled to death several times because of the strange creatures and the fact that if you absorb a bad soul your health is lost... and the room was full of them. Oh, and if you die, you have to redo the entire stage. DAMMMMMMMMMIT!!!!!!!!OVERALL: This is one of the worst games ever made for the Xbox. Terrible shooting mechanics, no fun challenges, awful music, terrible save system and numerous cheap deaths.THE GOOD: Good comic book-style graphics, controls work somewhat in the beginning.THE BAD: Controls don't work the rest of the time, crappy challenges, awful music, the worst protagonist ever put in a game, terrible save system, and so many cheap deaths.\n",
      "The idea for this game first appealed but then when i started playing it everthing just fell apart. The camera angles and the gun control that drake has is just terrible.  Once again the idea for this game was one that sadly didn't turn even half as good as i thought as thought it would be. One of the bigest disappointment ever!!!!  Graphics=3/10  Gameplay=4/10  Control=3/10  Story( didi mention that the story line is one one of the worst i've ever witnessed?)=1/10  Overall=2/10  1/5\n",
      "Two words can describe this garbage.....it sucks..I won't even go to detail all I will say is not only is the gameplay glitched up and horrible to do especially how to controll drake, but the story is just plain stupid.  Gamer no how doesn't know what he's talking aboutGameplay is just plain awfulMusic...............I'm not even gonna go thereThe controls is just plain awfulI have to give it a 1 out of 5...Hell I wish I could give it -5 stars but I can'tWHAT EVER YOU DO DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!\n",
      "I have heard for years,about how terrible this game was.Never trying it,I thought to myself...\"hey,it really can't be THAT bad\". Well let me tell you something folks...it is!!! As a matter of fact,it's so bad that you will wanna toss it in the trash. Oh my God,I don't even know where to begin with this piece of junk. The controls,gameplay,graphics,sound and story,stink to high heaven!!! There.That should be enough for you to not wanna waste a single cent on this dud. Save your money.\n",
      "Why a 1?a) The game is devoid of fun.b) You move about as fast as a crippled snail, even when running.c) The NPC's \"talk\" after you have concluded your text-based talking.d) The graphics may have been good about 5 years ago but they are just muddy and dull now.e) The game is open ended but as a result there is nothing really to do, and the land is so barren that you just get incredibly bored very fast.I now know why there is no demo for this game, if there were no one would buy it.BTW, some have argued that the \"slowness factor\" is a graphic/system problem but it is not.  Your \"character\" simply is exceedingly slow, there is little jaggies or system level slowness.  If you have played something like everquest or WoW, think of it like this; running in Morrowind is at the speed of walking in those games, and walking in Morrowind is about half that speed.Also, the \"since of wonder\" at seeing stars is old, been done everywhere and doesn't impress.  Walking down a road and seeing a door stuck in the side of a mountain means \"dungeon\" in morrowind...there is no since of wander, the dungeons are doors in the side of a mountain.finally, if you want to buy this thing go ahead, clearly it appeals to some people.  I rate it as one of the worst games I've ever spent money on and furthers my belief that if a game doesn't  over a demo then there is some reason they are hiding it until after you make the purchase.\n",
      "This is ONE OF THE WORSE GAMES I have ever had the displeasure of buying and wasting money on.  I personally will never buy another game from Bethesda again.  After all of the hype about the game, me and my spouse bought it.  After 10 minutes of play, we found that this game required too much camera angling, two hands to use a mouse and keyboard.  The hot keys, even customized, required way too much time to even enjoy the game.  This game, in my opinion, is for people who enjoy complex playing, and not medium to simple play.I am sure the game is great, but until a version comes along where I don't have to use one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse, pass this one by.\n",
      "You know I bought this game think I could play it, but you know what I booted this game into my xbox and it didn't work. Took me a while to figure out that it was a pc game, so I got it installed and it ran well, but you see I was born with one hand, and could not manage to play this with one hand. I mean what the hell a mouse and a keyboard are required to play, last bethesda game I buy.\n",
      "I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This \"game\" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy!\n",
      "I loved &quot;Max Payne&quot;. From the day I bought it, I was hooked. I finished it, and anxiously awaited the sequel. When It cam out, I played it over at a friends house. I still have not bought it. I was just disappointed with how they took the storyline. In the game, there's no mention as your playing, of the first game(unless you play the &quot;previously&quot; video in the game). Secondly, Max looks NOTHING like he did in the original! I can understand that times change, and I read how super looking max now is, compared to the original, but His looks didn't strike me as great. Medicore, I would say. And last but not least, if you don't have high specs for this game, don't even bother wasting your money, or downloading the demo(especially if your a dial up user). It's just not worth it. I'll stick with the original instead, this game, in my opinion blows goats.\n",
      "If you're fortunate to have one of the CD drives this game supports, it's decent, however there's no way for you to know ahead of time.  Their tech support is near worthless with my request for help having them tell me that I need a second computer to test it on... Yes, to get support you apparently have to have a computer lab to verify on.  The game worked on my old CD drive, the only difference is a new DVD drive.  My other DVD drive in this computer won't work either. They've had this long w/out patching their cruddy protection?  They aren't going to if they haven't by now.  Avoid this like the plague unless you feel safe downloading a no CD crack or need an expensive beer coaster.The game picks up shortly after the first Max Payne game.  You have Bullet Time again, but this time you're able to move at normal speed, so any illusion of it just being enhanced perception is removed.  You are not a man, but inexplicably a super hero.  You also get to play as Mona Sax, who was supposedly killed in the first game, but for some reason has the same powers you do.  There are some levels where you switch between the two, one defending the other or completing different tasks.  There are some pretty cool levels where you end up in a gang war with computer characters blasting away at each other and there are some improvements like not dying in dream sequences, but the story falls short of the first game.\n",
      "The game is to \"click\",that is it requires to many steps per event, and thats very distracting.The program does not work when trying to raid other merchants,just allows pirates to defeat youbefore you have a chance to respond.Old tech graphics, poor programing in all areas of the game.I'm very disappointed with this game, and disposed of it promptly.\n",
      "I found this game for cheap and it still wasn't worth it.  Not at all scary or suspenseful.  You know if you're entering a room, something's going to pop up at you.  Again.  And Again.  There are countless dead ends and single rooms that lead no where...you fight through five gouls only to get some health to recover what you lost fighing the gouls.  The monsters are unoriginal and, for the most part, indistinguishable from each other.  You have to lead your family to safety, which means back tracking to the beginning of the game, leading AI challenged characters who are easily left behind.To top it all off, all of it is timed, so there's little time for exploration or examination of your surroundings.  This was probably done on purpose so you wouldn't notice the complete lack of creativity or detail.Oh, another treat...if you accidentally hit &quot;reload&quot; on your revolver, it reloads it...even if it has a full cylinder...and dumps the unsed bullets on the ground, using up your ammo.  Brilliant.I've played the game once, didn't finish it, and probably won't play it again.\n",
      "I'm sorry to say that this is the worst Final Fantasy to date! I played for a month and the whole thing was basically just about running around and leveling up. Not really any kind of storyline to follow, very hard to get into since the instructions don't give you any clue as to where to go and how to get started. Not to mention you have to pay $12.00 a month to play such a boring game! I recommend you spend your money on Final Fantasy X-2 instead!\n",
      "I love MMORPGs, but I have limited time, so that makes joining groups rare for me. With this kind of game it pretty much requires you to group. Also, when you buy this game, don't plan on playing it the same day. It took over 5 hours to install, register and download all the updates. This is on an athlon 64 with 1.5 gigs of ram and a cable modem. The whole Playstation interface is just horrible for a computer game, and the constant loading of areas really kills the feel of this game. Also, the need to load each different area has caused me to die several times, because the game has a tendancy to load you right next to monsters. Also, there is no real exploring of this game unless you are at least the level of surrounding monsters. Anything with a higher level than you have WILL kill you, unfortuntely doing anyhting as simple as checking the level of the monster you are fighting requres several clicks of the mouse. Oh, forgot to mention that there seem to be about 3 monsters per area, and they go from extremely weak, to extremely powerfull. You can't tell how powerfull a monster is going to be untill it kills you.Overall this game was just horrible. I spent about a month playing it every chance I had and in the end I felt cheated of my time and money. It was more frustrating than fun, but I kept thinking if I get to the next level it wil be more fun. Well, it never got fun.\n",
      "Besides FF10, this FF is just the worst of the series. It's also a terrible MMORPG. If you want real MMORPG, check out Ultima Online. It is actually reasonable on the quests. As with FF11, you have to level up to extreme levels just to ride chocobos, etc. The quests are boring and tedius. This is not for MMORPG, it's not even really for hardcore FF fans. FF is better single player, and I suggest starting at FF6 (known as FF3 on snes) and work you way up.\n",
      "This game doesn't compare to World of Warcraft.  Final Fantasy should never have gone online because it ruins the whole series.  FFX2 was bad enough...Be a sport and switch over to WoW and see what a MMORPG is really made of.\n",
      "This review has nothing to do with the actual gameplay of the game.  Because of bad business practices and incompentence on Playonline's part, I haven't been able to play the game at all.Ok, to start off, I have owned this game for only twelve hours and am already completely frustrated.  For the twelve hours that I have owned this game, the servers have been down for six.  The registration server went down right after I gave them my credit card information (pretty convenient if you ask me).Once that got going, they wanted me to download an update for the game.  That's cool, I was expecting this, but the update was like 16,000 files and several gigs of information!  Have they ever made update files before?  Why did I even spend the time to install the game if I had to redownload all the files anyways?  The setup continues...  Finally!  Now I have the updated FFXI and am ready to play.  My frustration is starting to subside.  I click the play button...  ...  ...  ...  All servers down for maintenance!?  Ok, here's a concept: backup servers!At this point, I am completely frustrated.  I call the customer service number (which isn't toll free by the way) to ask for my money back.  Customer service number is busy.  Try again....  ...busy.I love Final Fantasy games, and I also love MMORPGs.  I hate bad business practices, and Playonline is full of those.  Be warned, if you do purchase this game and want to take a few months off (three to be exact), you have to repurchase the game.  This is terrible terrible business, and I would have expected a lot more from the people who make Final Fantasy.  I would have loved to try this game, but that was not a possiblity.\n",
      "At first this game is very involving and very fun, but then you start to get into the higher levels and you realize something that is stated as &quot;Easy Prey&quot; can easily kill you.  Also, every group camps out at the same place.  So if your in a group of 6 and are lv 25, you can bet there will be like 5 other groups of six camping the same ol' spot.  Also, this game is not enjoyable at all.  It's not even a game, it's more like a full time job.  Trying to gain levels is like trying to convince waiting for your hair to grow.  Also, once you have spent 2 hours gaining 500 exp (its is 5600 exp to gain a level at higher levels), and then die and lose 700 you will be very angry.  This is when you look over at the clock and realize you just spent 2 hours to lose 200 exp, wow that's fun!!!  So, ignore all the other positive reviews of this game cause it truly is horrible.  Also, I have been a fan off the FF seris until 10.  10 sucked, so did 10-2, and so will 12.  In fact Square Enix sucks, Square needs to break away from Enix and start making quality games like FF7 again.  Anyway, if you have no ambition and want nothing more than to sit in front of a computer all day then please get this game.  If you would rather enjoy yourself get a normal RPG that has a plot, not an MMORPG.\n",
      "I had, unfortunately, very high expectations of this game. I mean, Final Fantasy... MMORPG? Whoa! The best of two worlds collide!Unfortunately, the result of the collision is a horrid mess.  Square smashed this game out of the park graphically, and the sounds effects and music are decent too. Unfortunately as well, that's where the positives stop.- The UI is awful and unintuitive.- Play control is ruthlessly cumbersome.- Players are (mostly) unhelpful to new players.- Race/Class combination is pretty boring. Each race has a \"best\" class and most people go that route.- Did I mention play control is horrible?- The combat system is, also, unintuitive. I *highly* recommend playing a melee character as a first. Any casting class will be killed over, and over, and over. And apparently this is just blindly accepted.- The chat system is pesky.- Oh yeah... the play control? Don't even get me started on it.Now, the reason I weighed Play Control so heavily is because, in ANY MMORPG, you're going to spend a LOT of time traveling around. A *lot*. That, mixed with the horrible UI and combat system just make for a very frustrating experience. If you want a game with any sort of substance? Do yourself a favor and check out World of Warcraft. Or even Dark Age of Camelot.\n",
      "I receieved this game to find out that even though it was described to be playable on PS2, to find out this brand new disc does not even read on my PS2. Note I have no problems with any other PS2 games I own. This was the first one that was unplayable. I've heard this type of thing happening to other PS2 owners and now know the gaming tales are sadley true.\n",
      "Boy did they really screw this game up...First of all, you can tell that this is not emulated...The games all have a different feel, sounds are not quite right etc...The whole layout is bad, and takes place in an arcade... Funny the intellivision was a HOME system...And the background music makes me want to pound my head into a wall after a few minutes..Some games I can't even get to start...This is almost as bad as the 25 in 1 controller...Of all the \"retro\" out there, they really screwed up Intellivision big time..Intellivision deserves much better than the cr*p they are putting out..Spend the money at a yard sale and buy the real console because this is horrible..\n",
      "I purchased this because it said in the description that it was an official Nintendo controller, it is not. It does, however, look exactly like the official Nintendo controller so I figured there wouldn't be much difference, but boy was I wrong.After a week the C stick would stick, meaning you would have to manually center it when not using it. The Z button also stuck, and I have yet to be able to to fix this... so when I play games with this controller it plays like the Z-button is constantly being held down.Do not buy this, and I suspect many of the other GameCube controller deals online are similar to this. I'd recommend just going to the store and making sure you get an official Nintendo product, or even a quality 3rd party controller.\n",
      "I bought this game because I really liked Return To Castle Wolfenstein, but didn't realize that the entire game is for online multiplayer crap... If you're looking for single player action, this sure as hell isn't it! Save your money...\n",
      "No, it wasn't.  I remember being very excited when Driver 1 was supposed to come out.  You were supposed to be a gangster, running from the law, a game built oin the same engine (same physics) as the destruction derby games.BUT, whoever made Driver 1 thought it way too controversial to make a villian as the lead, so they decided to make it an &quot;on the run&quot; police officer.  that was weak and i lost interest in it, don't care how great the game was.  do i want a watered down version of an artist's vision?  please, why don't you put that fig leaf on &quot;David&quot;'s unit in Florence.So, here we go, now we have driv3r, a couple years after the GTA wave breaks.  yay!  in driv3r they finally let you get out of the car and do foot missions, fight, shoot, run over people, now that the coast is clear.  there is nothing innovative about what they are trying to do here.  driv3r is not the original.  any company that forfeits it's edginess to be politically correct will not get my money.  might as well have tipper gore in the passenger seat the whole time, telling tanner what he could and could not do.\n",
      "This game was definately not worth the hype (If there was any). I remember seeing a commercial for it and I was thinking \"GTA ripoff\" and it pretty much is. GTA is alot better than this in everything, this game was to bland. I got bored with this really, really quick.\n",
      "Okay, I'm not going to waste alot of time beating a dead horse, all of the negative comments about this game are ALL true.  Remember the car grabbing light poles from Driver1?  They are here, along with shoddy physics, poor aiming control, and a lack of speed that will disgust you.  You can grab the fastest car in the game, aim it down the longest straight away you can find and you'll still not have any feeling of REALLY moving.  I loved Driver, and even Driver 2, but this game should have been properly de-bugged before release.  Long and short-save your cash, rent first, and you'll see what I and so many others have said all along- this game sucks.\n",
      "Way back in the olden days I played a game called Driver for PC (what a rush), car physics were funky and cool, Miami at night was moody and mysterious and the cop chases... well for get about it, it was great!  And all that painful pop-up?  Come on it was 1998 after-all.  Well here we are, it's 2004, Driv3r has been loooong awaited by those of us who adored the first offering from Reflections and now that we have it, all I can say is... \"what the h#ll?!\"  I'll only review this on the graphics merits, so if you like the game play and can numb yourself to the absolutely pathetic textures look away now.  Talk about pop-up, \"holy.. where did that car come from Batman\", the AI vehicles (not to mention buildings trees, power poles and peds) appear out of nowhere not more than a block away at times, they don't fade in, they just appear like some crazy magic trick.  Textures tear and flicker and quite frequently disappear all together just to reappear again.  Now mind you the lighting effects are beautiful (note Miami at dusk bathed in that golden tropical glow), but there is absolutely very little draw distance and the unbelievable amount of graphics glitches that are found at ever turn are utterly disappointing and inexcusable, they may have passed muster back in the day but not at a time when Project Gothem 2 and Grand Tourismo rule the roads.  I went back and ran PG2 and recounted Wreckless last night just to make sure I wasn't being too hard on poor old Driv3r but I came away being even harder on it.  Great video games start with (can you imagine) great graphics!  Call me a graphics geek but if a title can't draw me in visually then the journey for me and that title will be a short one.  How the creative teams at Reflections and finally Microsoft let this pass to distribution with so many bugs to work out is beyond me, Xbox has so much riding on the quality of the games to sell itself that allowing such a shoddy example of workmanship find a place on store shelves is inexcusable.  On the upside however Driv3rs' opening cut scene is the most cinematic I've ever seen, and frankly stunning!  The levels (cities) are huge and exacting in their detail but the clipping and over-all poor graphics execution relegates what could have easily been one heck of a game to the \"should-a, could-a, would-a\" file.  Simply put... I was expecting so much more and got far less than I could have ever imagined from Driv3r and how sad.\n",
      "I bought this game a few weeks ago from Target for $23.52 (it also included a 2nd disc with tips) I had a $5 coupon as well.  This game is unbelievably frustrating I can't believe reflections spent nearly 3 years developing this game.  While the graphics are nice and some how impressed me some what it doesn't make up for the frustrating and dull gameplay. Here is a list of cons because there just aren't enough positives things to say about this game.CONSDriving controls are very sensitive and your car tends to slide like as if it were on iceon foot controls (I like to call it run n gun) are cumbersome to say the least and the aiming system isn't very good at all either.Did I mention that this game is on the difficult side and sometimes very frustrating?  I was on the mission where you had to stop the gator for good and trying to drive and shoot at the same time just PO'd me right off.I have played other games similar to this True Crime Streets of LA The Getaway and of course GTA.  Driver may of pioneered this genre but this installment was just poorly put together.  Many games of this genre may come and go but Grand Theft Auto is still king of the genre.  If you are really interested in checking out this game I strongly recommend renting this (I wish I had done so) or waiting for the price to drop to under $20.\n",
      "Just bad, plain bad the only thing saving this game is its theater or replay mode. And using cheats in this game is fun too. But the single player is the worst I've seen in a video game. Its like the developers spent more money on the cutscenes then the actual game. Because the controls handle poorly the missions are structured poorly everything in this game feels shallow and has that \"been there done that feel\". Just avoid this game and please save your money don't support badly designed games like this.\n",
      "I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and out of the games I have played this is the worst. I have to say that the characters are stupid, obnoxious, and terribly crated. But on the plus side the graphics are fantastic and not very glitchy The only decent character is Koko. This is the worst game in my 100 games that I have.\n",
      "i found this at a resale shop for $2 im glad i didn't buy it on amazon for $10. This was the worst game i ever played. It was so bad you would't believe it. Please take my word for it and don't buy this game and waste your money.\n",
      "I have played this game for 5 days and I coulnt get passed the first level.It is slower than turtles and very hard.When you walk into another room, oh my gosh, I can take a coffe break of how long it takes to load.How long dose it take one person to just read something like \"Womens Restroom\".If you love Resident Evil.For this game you can just kiss your Residential Evil likeness goodbye.\n",
      "This game has impressive graphics, but it's unbelievable how many hold times there are!!! Every single time you change a room, there is a hold time.  I felt like I was waiting half the time and playing the game the other half.  I actually want to play more of this game, but I don't want to deal with waiting every minute or so when I have to go into another room.  Get rid of the countless hold times and this game is great.  They should have put more time/effort into this game.\n",
      "I waited until the day this game came out to buy it.I was hoping for this game to be really fun like RE1,2,3 and code veronica but when I put it in I was Uterly disapointed,the game play was very bad with very bad controls,The other Resident Evil games had better controls.The other thing is that this game had no story line, you just start off in a bar and run from zombies.Do not get this game just wait for RE4.\n",
      "After playing a few of the other RE games, I was excited about this one, despite the different programmers.  Utter disappointment was my experience.  In fact, I haven't even attempted other RE games by the same programmers, which were obviously just generated with the RE name for the money.\n",
      "Ok this does have the best graphics, but I dont care what anybody says the friking loading time  u have to wait everytime u enter a room almost makes u want to shoot yourself! It ruined the whole game for me, I seriously threw it away.\n",
      "While I have played this game one on one, I have not played the game on-line.  This may explain the difference between my one star rating and the multitude of five star ratings for this product.As a one person game, Resident Evil Outbreak does not live up to its predecessors.  Gone is any semblance of a plot.  This is unfortunate since most of the charm of the prior incarnations of this game came from the storyline.Gone also are intuitive controls.  Here you have to load each bullet into your gun.  Haven't any of these people ever heard of clips.  And most frustrating is the snail pace with which the characters accomplish every task.  Unless you are running which is immpossible to maintain if you are trying to accomplish anything else, you move at the rate of 1 mile an hour.At some point I feel that a franchise such as the Resident Evil franchise simply puts out products because they know people will buy them based on name recognition.  I believe this is the case here.  Resident Evil: Code Name Veronica was the last decent game made along this line (I do not own a Nintendo system).  Save your money for a game worthy of the $50 price tag.  This game is a rental at best.\n",
      "Man, I'm glad I rented instead of buying. This game is unbelievably bad. The reasons are way too many to list. I just wanted to contribute some bad feedback to a game that truly does not deserve to be called Resident Evil. If you thought the movie was great, you're probably mindless enough to like this game. If not, stay away.\n",
      "Resident Evils 1&2 for the original Playstation are two of the best games ever made.  RE2 alone surpasses nearly all the other horror based games that were created for the consule, and there were plenty to follow.  With the evolution of the new gaming systems came new Resident Evil games.  RE Nemsis proved to be a challenging game of cat and mouse.  RE Survivor squandered in its attempt to switch the horror genre to the first person.  Now Resident Evil is back on the Playstation after some new titles under the Nintendo name.  The suspsense and antcipation for the game were killing me so I quickly bought it when it was released in April of this year.  Little did I know that the game itself would kill me.  RE Outbreak is quite frankly the most dissapointing horror game in the storied franchise.  The game is bad, very bad, and it has a number of reasons why.  First, you can not turn a survial based game into a team effort.  The fact that you have to help nearly everyone in this game just as much as yourself is ridiculous.  The game doesn't allow you to focus on the tasks and puzzles at hand, not to mention the 5 billion zombies that are thrown your way.  The loading screens are absolutely agonizing.  They were never good on the PSOne, so you think with the adaption to the PS2 this minor glich would get cleared up.  Oops.  The story is slow, the characters are dull, and the constant reptitive lines spoken by them is enough to make you want to turn into a zombie.  Oh wait, you can in this game, and then kill all of your teammates.  What?  Who came up with that brillant idea?  With such a storied past you think Capcom would play off its original success.  Instead, Resident Evil Outbreak is dead on arrival.\n",
      "I have a very state-of-the-art computer with all the accelerated video, drivers, sound, etc that is needed to run any game., with all the drivers kept up to date.  This game wouldn't even load and kept crashing the system, even to the \"blue screen\" of dumping physical memory.  I ran all patches, changed video modes, changed compatibility modes and nothing would work.  If that's any indication of what's left for problems if it ever runs, check out the other reviews of those who actually got it to work...lots of problems.  What a shame such a promising game ended up such a waste.\n",
      "I just finished playing this game last night. It was the worse adventure game I've ever played. The dialogue is inane. The voice acting is horrible. The body language is goofy. The navigation is a painful exercise in frustration. The puzzles and tasks are either pointless or impossibly difficult or both. I had to consult two different walkthroughs just to get through some of the puzzles.It's really too bad because the visuals are stunning. The graphics and colors are very good and the cutscenes are especially nice. But these things are not enough to save this game from being truly awful to get through.\n",
      "Normally I love Sonic The Hedgehog but this was the worst game Ive ever played in my life.Do not buy this game.\n",
      "There are good reasons this game never really took off, here are 3.1)The gameplay was severly lacking in almost all aspects. The power speed fly switch up was poorly designed, and they do the same thing every time. The levels were done very bad too. You also don't get as much freedom as in previous sonic games. Its pretty much there way or shut off the system and get a life way.2)O thats soooo awsome 4 different sonic teams! WRONG! There may be 4 different teams, but they all do the same levels, so what's the point? Same levels same skills BORING!3)No Choas! those little guys were awsome. Im going to miss um.So all in all if you buy this game you can still sell it back on amazon. O yeah the sound and music was bad to, I can still hear that stupid robot chanting...\n",
      "If I were you I would rent this game first. From Sonic's first adventure on the genesis up till SADX Sonic was a huge hit. On my scale Sonic went from a 5 down to about a 3.5. Why did they even put knuckles on his team because he was his second worst enemy(first is Eggman,hehe) back in the early 90's. Sonic should always fly solo or with his best pal Tails and not flying around in weird formations and making fantasised attacks.If you still intend on getting a Sonic game on crack then rent this before you buy it.\n",
      "the basic formula to ruin a sonic game is to throw  in extra playable characters, now play as three at one time? no thanksSonic should be about running and rings this game was mostly about that but it gets to the point where you're running around the halloween/haunted house levels for hours and hours! i still have not beaten that game and i've had it for years.sure it's ok...but once you beat it you'll never want to play it again i\n",
      "the concept of the game is great! half the stuff you can let the AI do for you concerning econimics, trade, manpwer, military leaders, et al. but some basic stuff like changing from army to navy management cant be done! or seeing and possibly retreating from certain territories under atack! to heck with diplomacy if you cant do these basics forget it!\n",
      "i've seen a LOT of overrated games, but this one amazed even me.take max payne.  remember how it was really hard without bullet time?  ok.  take away most of the bullet time, turn it into an FPS where you die every time you run out of bullet time (oh, excuse me, \"slow-mo due to your guy's amazing reflexes\"), include a bunch of super-standard guns and environments, and voila, a highly rated, great-selling game.why do people love it?  one word:  GRAPHICS.  yeah, those bullets look so amazing whizzing by you in slow-mo...  who cares?  looks don't make a great game.  gameplay does.\n",
      "In fairness, \"F.E.A.R.\" excels in several areas. First, the combat style is innovative and fresh, even though it wears thin after a while. The slow-motion option is a nice touch, but the programmers should have let you use it only in certain situations. As it stands in the game, it's far too easy to slip into slow-mo and eradicate enemies without much problem. The game would have been ten times more difficult if this ability had been limited. As it was, even while playing on \"hard\" level, I died only once or twice and beat the game in a relatively short period of time. Secondly, as noted by other reviewers, the sound and lightning effects are superb. The shadows are especially good and can lead to some scary moments. Third, it's nice how the programmers included a function that lets you \"test drive\" the graphics frame rate prior to actually playing the game. This lets you determine which bells and whistles slow down your system and which do not.Unfortunately, the good aspects noted above cannot outweigh the bad. First off, the violence and language are taken to a ridiculous extreme. Thankfully, you can reduce the gore (somewhat) in the game menu, and there is a patch that removes most (though not all) of the foul language, but that's not sufficient to salvage the effort. The game would have been just as good -- even better -- without all of the needless violence and potty mouths. Other games, especially those in the adventure genre, create legitimately scary atmospheres without resorting to cheap horror movie tricks (remember, the best selling PC game of all time is a non-violent point-and-click adventure game that is truly unique). The key to creating a sense of scariness is to leave most everything to the imagination of the gamer. \"F.E.A.R.\" does this well in some instances, but in others it jumps overboard and drowns.In terms of story and level design, the initial missions are quite good, but the novelty quickly wears off into boredom. One of the good things about \"Half Life 2\" is the level variety. There is constantly something to engage your mind, not just your trigger finger. In \"F.E.A.R,\" the levels are basically the same and the pattern grows tiresome. The story is pieced together in a fragmented way. I had to search online to figure out what exactly happened in the end. The system requirements are also way off the charts. I have a fairly decent computer (2.8GHz Pentium 4, 1.5GB PC3200 RAM, GeForce 6800GT graphics), and I could not run the game on high resolution without getting significant lag. Even with the graphics turned down, I could only get an average of 35 frames per second, which is not the best. Perhaps it's due to poor programming, since \"Half Life 2\" provides equal graphics without eating your computer's hardware.While there are some fun aspects, overall the game gets a losing score due to needlessly excessive violence and language, a terribly plotted story, and boredom-inducing levels.\n",
      "This game is so popular only because of advertisement. Just think about these facts: the single player is so short that it take no longer than 4 hours, and the story is extremely stupid, especially the ending when there is nuclear explosion, and our hero flyes out of there on helecopter!!!The multiplayer is one of the worst FPS multiplayers. Coupal weapons, similar maps, same skins and few stupid mods.The ONLY thing about this game is its graphics, but they ain't looking SO good, it just will be VERY laggy, unless you have the BEST video card.+It is secured by securom, which means if you have ANY cd-emulators installed, this game WILL NOT WORK.Will say something like \"security modul cannot be activated\". If you ever had this problem with any games, you definitely will have it here.\n",
      "Although this game is fun to play, it is a nightmare to install.  My husband spent several weekends trying to get the game to install and play without crashing even though we more than exceeded the minimum requirements.  After countless hours with tech support and on gaming forums, after my husband pulled what was left of his hair out (just kidding) and cursed and threatened and verbally abused the game and it's developers (not kidding) F.E.A.R. is finally up and running.Once installed, the game is a really fun - but linear - FPS.  With headphones on and the lights out, some parts are really creapy (in a good way).\n",
      "Si Doom 3 te parecio poco preparese para ese nuevo FPS. FEAR es un juego reciente ke porta no solo uno de los motores graficos mas exquisitos, sino tambien una tematica de survival/horror nunca antes vista digna de una produccion de hollywood. La accion y el miedo se combinan perfectamente para proporcionar una experiencia llena de adrenalina.\n",
      "F.E.A.R. was hyped to be one great horror shooter.  It delivers some good visuals, good positional audio, but...The story is way too poorly covered to convey any real sense of dread - OK, you're fighting evil, but how and when and why Alma became this evil agent is never really explained - nor is most of the rest of the story.It's doled out piecemeal, as you'd expect with a horror game, but the first 80% of the game has 20% of the story, while the last 20% (when you get to the underground site) has about 40% of the story squished into a small timeframe and area.  That's right - 40% + 20 % = 60%.  So where is the other 40%?  Apparently, hopefully, somewhere in the sequel.The game plays like a cardboard cutout shooter, too.  The weapons are wimpy (except one, which has too wide of an area of effect to use it for most of the game).  The levels are very drab, run of the mill shooter stuff - big pipes and wooden crates are everwhere.It's also very short, and the ending, because of the story elements left out of the game, comes up very abruptly.This shooter is nothing new...sadly, it's the same old Resident Evil clone, dressed up in a 2004 era engine.\n",
      "This is another game that won't run on modern pc's.  Again, I went online - as this is a fairly new game and it SHOULD run in compatibility mode but it will not.  I found out that once again, the developer went out of business and there is some flaw in the runtime code.  The people that are running it searched the internet for enthusiast fixes.  There is no developer fix.  If you like to fiddle with your software to get it working - buy it.  If you like it to run without spending days trying to find a fix for something that is inherently broken on the 'net then this is not for you.\n",
      "Unless you are never going to cancel your subscription, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The stupidest idea anyone has ever thought of: if your subscription is cancelled for more than 3 months, you must buy a new copy of the game, subscribe, and start over. Unless you paln to never cancel your subscription, I would suggest NOT buying this game.\n",
      "asking for this retarded game and having someone waste 100 on dollars on a gift for me when I could have bought something fun or useful no more square enix for me i'm boycotting after this waste of time. A game without an ending or point is retarded, this game is for people who dress up like elves, goblins, hobbits etc. in their homes and want to share their idiocy with the world.\n",
      "#1 It doesnt use a microphone.#2 It is the most complicated game for anything I have ever seen; in the game and just trying to get into the game.#3 It is very laggy even with cable internet.#4 It is not the best looking for graphics.#5 It has very in-need-of-help controls for movement.Dont buy this just for this game.  Trust me.  Unless your a die-hard FF fan then its your gamble.  I got the harddrive for Socom 2 and for all the games that will use it in the future.\n",
      "From spotty controls to boring combat, this game will not satisfy any sort of action buff's yearning for a good video game.  Don't waste your money.\n",
      "This game is pieced together from digital photos taken on the island of Capri.  The island is a beautiful place and perhaps it is worth the price simply to wander its roads and trails in this photo format.  However, after you have walked everywhere and picked up all the obvious 'clues' you honestly do not have a clue what you are suppose to be doing!  I must admit that I did not solve anything that I would consider a puzzle before I quit playing out of boredom.\n",
      "I was drawn to this game by one thing, and it turned out to be FAR from the truth, in my opinion.  The Box says &quot;think Myst but in a real location&quot;  not only does it not even compare to Myst in any way, but I found it  boring, tedious, and pointless, and after 2 days of wandering aimlessly through it and having no fun at all, I uninstalled it.\n",
      "This is the worst game I have come across in a long time. it is hard to understand the accent and there is no way of knowing what you have to do except to talk to people with these accents. If you buy it you will not even try to play it to it's fullest as it is a dud. stay away from it\n",
      "Again, an interesting concept that just doesn't work well.  This game is like looking at someone's lousy and boring photo collection of their trip to Capri.  I sold this game back to a store for a fraction of what I paid for it.  It really sucks.  Another case of intriguing packaging hiding a very lame product.  Oh well...live and learn!\n",
      "I really, really wish that I had read some reviews of this game before I bought it, because now I can't return it.  I could have spent my money on something much better than this string of snapshots with voiceovers attatched.  If this game were freeware, I probably would have liked it, but it's not.  Instead, it's a twenty dollar game that plays like freeware and has packaging like Myst.Incidentally, it was the references to Myst on the packaging that led me to buy this game.  The packaging says, &quot;Think Myst but in a real location&quot; (Quandary).  True, like this game, Myst was basically snapshots of a fictional world that you could occaisionally interact with, much like this game, but there's a few big differences between Myst and this game.  Myst never really felt like a string of snapshots to me, because the world it depicted was so beautiful and mysterious, and the puzzles were so engaging.  Capri is beautiful, but moving through it is confusing and frusterating.  There are so many places where one street looks just like another, which makes getting turned around or lost really easy, unless you check the map every step of the way, and doing that just makes the game feel even more clunky.  I enjoyed the scenery in Myst, but I could care less about the many, many snapshots of streets that A Quiet Weekend in Capri includes.  There should really be a better way to navigate the world of this game.  I haven't finished this game yet, but the puzzles mostly seem to involve doing errands for people, which, combined with the frusterating navigation, becomes incredibly tedious.  The people themselves are another annoying aspect of the game.  It's impossible to talk to any of them, which seems odd for a game that takes pride in being located in a real place.  You'd think being able to talk to people would add to the reality of it.  The people themselves are also snapshots, by the way.  They are never animated, even when they're talking - even Myst animated talking people.  There are, in fact, very few animations in this game.This game has, for me, redefined bad games.  I cannot believe that someone allowed this game to be released.  It's amazing to me that someone seriously thought that basing a game off of thousands of touristy photographs would be a good idea - and some of the photos aren't even all that good, blurry, with bad composition, or lens flares.  My plan is to sell this game as soon as I can.  Although I can't get cash from any of the places in my area, I can get game credit.  The next time around, I'll make sure I thoroughly research the game before I buy it.  This game may cost only twenty dollars, but it's a waste of every one of those dollars.  Do yourself a favor and get something better.  If you want to try this game, wait until it hits the bargain bins.\n",
      "If everyone has the same problem with a game, that's a bug. You shouldn't have to play a game 9 times to get through it. I've had characters disappear on screen, not be able to interogate witnesses, evidence be collected, and then disappear. Ubisoft (the games manufacturer) says it is a noted problem, but the patch they gave does not work, for all the problems. I feel that they rushed this game out to capitalize on the past success of the previous game. Time between announcement of release and release was a scanty 6 months. Is that enough time to put out a quality computer game?Also I had one other complaint about the game. Now it wants the CD in the disk drive for it to work, and it doesn't matter which cd. In the previous version, you could do a full install and not need the cd for it to run, which I thought was a definite plus.So wait for a unbugged version, or get the original version, which even though it was short, it worked. Don't waste your time or money on this. I was extremely disappointed, as I love CSI.\n",
      "This may possibly be the worst game I have ever played in my life. The game is more like a horrible RPG than and action shooter. All you do is walk around, find the bad guys and tell your men to shoot, that's right you don't even get to aim, you just tell your entire team to fire. I don't think this game even deserves 1 star!(The reason I put 1 star was because they wouldn't let me put 0) I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game. Trust me, IT'S A HORRIBLE GAME, AND STAY AWAY FROM IT! I can understand that this was made to train the troops in the field but at least make it fun like america's army! If you like this game, YOU SHOULD BE SHOT!\n",
      "It disgusts me that they would make a dinky fighter out of such a revolutionary movie.\n",
      "I read all the reviews and thought...\"how bad could it be, I mean it's Fight Club\" well, let me put it this way, I only paid $7 for this game and was still pissed and felt like I was ripped off. I hated it so much!!! The moves suck and are way to hard to do, and the game is just real boring...and they sure talk about \"Fight Club\" and \"Project Mayhem\" quite openly (two things they are not supossed to talk about at all). I hope by the time you read this and all the other reviews you take our word and decide not to waste your time or money like we did...If you love the movie, you'll hate the game...\n",
      "To say the idea of making a video game based on Fight Club raised an eye brow was saying it lightly.  What could have been an otherwise decent fighting game is loaded with glitches, bugs, horrible controls, blocky graphics, and a lame fighting engine.  Not to mention that since the game's license, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk and the revolutionary film, is the main selling point of the game, if you took away the license this would just be a run of the mill fighter that is a wonder it ever got approved for production.  None of the fighters, save for Bob, look like their movie counterparts, which isn't surprising, but it would have been nice (you can only beat up Fred Durst so many times).  Also, each fighter's moves are so generic and similar to each other that it seems like not much thought had been put into the game.  All in all, fans of the book and movie who may have wanted to check this out are better off leaving this on the shelf where it belongs, it's not even worth renting.\n",
      "I'll make this short and sweet...This game blows from clunky bad controls to the \"obviosly showing\" unfinsished gameplay and desighn.  Save your self from playing this garbage..Get the film it's excellent..Lates\n",
      "This game sucks big time! The characters are retarded looking,the gameplay is crap,the music is very annoying,the game modes are dull...It's just an all around bad game. You can tell whoever made this game,tried their best to make this a Tekken clone,and failed terribly. There are some unlockables in Fight Club,but they are not worth the time to unlock. Overall,I highly recommend you don't pay one dollar for this game. If you want a good fighting game for your ps2,then pick up any of the Mortal Kombat's or any of the REAL Tekken games,and leave this piece of garbage alone. If there is ANY reason at all to buy this game,it's to laugh at and nothing more.\n",
      "Hello and welcome to my review. This game isn't that bad but the interaction and alot of the controls of this game are alittle too hard for most players. (I had no problem but many of my friends were using words to describe it that isn't worth mentioning.) The storyline is alittle dry with no real mission laid out and only through dry humor can you advance in some points. It would have been nicer to have a list of choices-maybe in the next version. It was too easy to beat and did it in less than 2hrs. So if your bored and renting a game-this is for you. If your a hard-core RPG'r......then you want something more to sink your teeth into. Just my opinion. :-) Happy Holidays\n",
      "This is not good game and the graphics are dated. I really purchased this as an add-on to Pacific Fighters,which is also produced by Ubisoft.The level of realisim and flight models are very poor and the control setup and user interface are very user unfriendly and would be very difficult for the novice,desktop flyer. Over all,this is the worst Sim/Flying-game ever made. Don't waste your money on this one.\n",
      "Just blew $35 on Far Cry and Pandora Tomorrow ... no more purchases from UBI Software ... guess we all have to install regular CD drives to play this company's games ... well, I'm physically disabled and not going to pay $50 for some to install a $20 part to play a $20 game(... one company's games) ... so many decent games out there(FPS/RPG/RTS), I'm not jumping through hoops to play anyones game ... if it doesn't work on my system, as it is, I'll pass - I have no copy software, just one basic CD-RW drive that came with my computer ... I hope UBI Software take a nice revenue hit for this bs anti-piracy nonsense\n",
      "Just a friendly warning to all CDR/CDRW/DVDR/DVDRW drive owners.  UBI Soft as a \"feature\" on their PC software that prevents installation from any drive with write capacity.  Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, just to grab a random example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in \"some\" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.UBI Soft's tech support has said that this \"feature\" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  \"Flawed\" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.I'm certain this game deserves more than 1 star, and suspect it will see some good reviews from people who are able to install, but I can't give it more than a single.  That's a commentary on UBI Soft and their \"feature\", not about the game itself.  In fact, when I get around to writing a review of the XBox version, it may well merit a 5-star rating.\n",
      "I love Mk games, so i bought this one. I don't know why, this game is just not a great game. It is not a bad game, but I honestly would rather play the first MK on game boy color. This game is only fun the first ten minutes or so. This game isn't worth more than 5 dolors, but that is only my opinion.\n",
      "This is NOT the game you want if you were introduced to the series by the 360 title Red Dead Redemption.It is a completely different game, and you get NONE of what made the RD:Redemption so great:Storyline - HORRIBLE. Depth of character is non-existent. Storyline follows several different characters, but it doesn' teach you much about them at all, except they have a reason to kill.Open world exploration - NONE. It's level for level. Hell, even N64 did WORLDS better in giving you games where you can just explore. In Redemption, this was probably one of the BEST features. You WERE IN the old west. Not in this game. It's completely linear, set up level by level. Going into the Sheriff's office takes you to the next 5 minute long level. Each area has nothing to explore. Even the original Mario ONE provided more to explore with their secret pipes. The main town in this game has a total of maybe 15 buildings, half of them \"closed.\"Shooting up the bad guys - SOOOO not fun. Everytime you shoot a bad guy, they go into this character animation where they react to the hit. . . . Cool right? NOPE! Once they are in that animation, any additional bullets you shoot their way do not count until they are done with the animation.If you are (LIKE ME) considering buying this game b/c you have a hunger to satisfy before Red Dead Revolution is eventually announced and released go buy some western movies (I can recommend a few). B/C this game is a huge disappointment. It's not even a genuine Rockstar game. It was developed by someone else and picked up by R* after they shelved it.\n",
      "This game might work okay on XBox, but it freezes up on XBox 360 when battling Bad Bessie even though it is supposed to be compatible.  There is supposed away around this but it is very hard to do.....stay away from Bessie and kill her at the same time.  Yea right........\n",
      "I just want to let people know how much dissappointed i am with this game. I just threw away my $50 bucks. I have a state of the art computer system and I can play every other online game with no issues like UT2004, City of heroes, all other Battlefield series, farcry, novalogic new game Joint operations and I have no problems. Meaning NO LAG. BFV=LAG plain and simple. It feels like you are playing a game in slow motion.The game is a memory hog that leeches to your system resources until your system cant spare anymore and dont release them which equals to \"SEVERE LAG=POORLY WRITTEN CODE\". Either your guy would freeze up for a few minutes or would move in time delayed jerky movements. You can pretty much do nothing, other than getting frustated at being totally hopeless and getting killed by the time your get some normal movements back and the process starts again. The game also spawns you right in the middle of a fight at your base at the same point everytime and you are a open bait for spawn campers. The graphics are also pretty unimpressive compared to what we currently have out there. I tried majority of the servers out there same lag issues, sometime it wont even let me log in while there are more than 10 vacant slots or more for some weird reason. I uninstalled the game for good after trying the new patch, reinstalling the game etc. I have gone back to playing the orginal BF1942 and its stable expansions. I would never buy another EA Battlefield series game again until its out for couple of months and gets good reviews. Its game that was released in its early beta state to mint some money. Save your money..or buy this game and burn it..your choice ofcourse.\n",
      "i know nobody cares what i think, but bf 1942 and bf vietnam are perhaps two of the worst games i've ever played.  in 2006, the controls are of course completely dated and terrible (though i don't care about the graphics, they're pretty cool actually).  bf vietnam does a great job at atmosphere.  you really feel like you're there in vietnam.  but then what happens?  the control of the weapons is TRASH.  talk about clunky!!!  the CALL OF DUTY series blows this game away in every regard.  sure, call of duty could learn some things from this game - how to use bigger maps and vehicles for example.  but as far as actual GAMEPLAY and excitement, call of duty is infinitely better.  there were times in this game where i'd go maybe 20 minutes without even seeing an enemy!  all you do is walk around, keep walking, keep walking... maybe this is like real war, but if i wanted to be a real soldier i'd go join the army.\n",
      "Only for the internet, unless you like playing in a small old school sandbox smaller than the first GTA, LoL, anyways, i Luckily sold it, whew'''', i hate games for the internet, I need action in my little world, not playing with some dumb punky little kid half way around the world :[)\n",
      "I have a new, near top-of-the-line Athlon64-based system with equivalent, advanced graphic card, a gigabyte of RAM etc yet this game was still full of bugs and play was mushy at best. At different times, I would get a sort of flare on the screen that would block out half of the action and effectively render that particular game over or unplayable. As a result, I have only played this game a couple of times, which hurts given the expense. I have tried looking for patches but frankly I resent having to spend so much time trying to effectively repair something that should have worked out of the box. This game looks promising with all of the new equipment but if it's not going to work smoothly, then it might as well be junk. Unfortunately, I don't have a nephew to give it away to.\n",
      "Unplayable FPS. Gameplay is very jerky, long loading times (two minutes or more when beginning a new scenario...you have to sit through almost an entire song while waiting), annoying/distracting lag when trying to go from stand to crouch to prone, awkward control/feel when attempting to pilot aircraft which I couldn't get the hang of despite endless attempts; overall a big disappointment... traded in to EB for ten bucks after a few days. Reccommend Call Of Duty instead.\n",
      "this game is horrible. the best part of the game was the training mode, where you could run around and shoot moving targets like duck hunt. even then, the controls were worse than GTA. it's difficult to shoot accurately. the programmers know this, thats why as long as the target turns red, its a hit, even if it looks like a no chance shot. You can drag bodies and switch clothes, but it all seems rather pointless. you can try and sneak around, but it seems like it doesnt matter. you can just kill them however you want anyway. reloading is riduclously slow too, and before you die, time slows down and so it seems like it takes f o r e v e r. There are a lot of other games out there. I don't recommend wasting cash on this one. if you're looking for a shooter like halo, try kill switch. if you're looking for a sneak around game like metal gear, try tenchu. if you're just looking for more violence, take it up a notch and try manhunt. save your money and pass on hitman.\n",
      "I wanted to play this game, but the seller...HERNANDO GAMES and owner C.L. BRAND run a shady business. They sent me a game (I purchased as VERY NICE condition) that had scratches and smudges all over it. He then had the nerve to tell me that they buff and polish their games...what a crock! He told me he would handle this personally and told me I could keep the game, but would like to show his staff. I sent back the game because it would freeze at the end of the first stage or I would have kept it! Then he insults me by saying that he would expodite the order! Don't go through the same thing and buy somewhere else! There are thankfully businesses that keep their promise of satisfied customers!\n",
      "I tried to like this game but no dice. I kept on comparing it to the much better SmackDowntitle by THQ.The controls were lame, the wrestlers seem to be punching rather then wrestling.During a match After about the 4th or 5th bunch they bleed already. The wrestler seem smallcompared to SmackDown.Look I have been a wrestling fan for about 20 years now andThis game really disappointed me. The reason I gave any stars is because of the roster ofWrestlers it has.My advice save the $$ for SmackDown vs Raw by THQ the real authorityon wrestling games.\n",
      "well i learned my lesson with rockstar and rented this one. i bought gtaIII because of the hype and hated it. once i got over the newness of running around anywhere i realized how much it sucked. then i bought manhunt, which was unspeakably terrible. i rented vice city which was alright...then in some moment of madness rented san andreas which was a ugly (ps1 level graphics) mess of a game. like gtaIII it was frequently too hard and frustrating and definitely not worth the effort. which leads to the warriors, a bad game based on a bad movie which plays badly. what more is there to say?\n",
      "The landscape is changing in the gaming market.  No more are Sega and Nintendo the uncontested big boys of the industry.  After knocking out NEC, Atari, and SNK, both Sega and Nintendo thought nobody would come along to challenge anymore.  But then came Sony with the Playstation platform, and now another solid heavyweight has tipped the scales, and heavy they are...Microsoft.Anybody that played Halo, even if they didn't exactly fall in love with the game, experienced the raw power of what XBOX was capable of.  No longer are LAN parties, and first person shooters just a PC specialty.The XBOX is a low-cost, high powered gaming PC, in a proprietary case.  Housing an Intel Pentium 3 processor, Invidia Graphics, a decent hard drive, and a built-in RJ-45 ethernet port.  The system comes with the Microsoft Controller S, a refined, and overall better design than the original Microsoft Controller.  You get four controller ports, like on the Nintendo GameCube.  DVD is an option, plus you can download your CD's to the internal hard drive.  Some games alow for personlized soundtracks/playlists, like Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball, and even Counter Strike.The system is physically large, and heavy.  Of the three major systems, it's the bulkiest.  But don't let the large design detur you from taking a look at this system, it's what's inside that really counts, and this system delivers the goods.\n",
      "The Xbox suck [...] The hunk of junk failed when I played for just 30 minutes! I got it running again for a while... When I tried to save it got automatically deleted. Any slack-jawed idiot would see that most of the Xbox games are on the computer.DUH!! I threw mine away instead of giving it back. Then I got a PS2 a few days after, the PS2 worked like a charm nothing bad happened. Well sure you have to buy memory cards for the PS2 but its worth it! What if you run out of memory on the Xbox what will happen huh? What! Open the electricution in a box! And if your trying to fix it(at least I did)if its broken don't try, it will just damage the game and I knew what I what I was doing(my dad works at a support center for broken electronics)If I were you trust me I know, get the PS2 its more durable and you can play longer for like over 12 hours since I was playing GTA San Andreas for PS2 not Xbox! And take note If you want a game thats on PS2 but you still want to keep your Xbox you have to wait a year or more for them to come out(well most of them)Buy a PS2 its better\n",
      "Where do I start? Ihate the xbox. Not one thing about it appeals to me except a handful of it's games. It's a bulky system that weighs more than the combined weight of the brains of the people who bought the xbox. The controllers themselves are larger than a ps2 or gamecube. It was made by nerds, for nerds. Most of it's games are on at least one other system and just made for the money. Microsnot's plan is to create a device that will net them even more money.ooohh look at me, I'm microsoft, i'm going to mak a big,crappy game system so i can be even more rich. Then I'll buy out all the good game companies and turn them into mainstream crap. I would rather drive a very sharp stick covered in dog doo in my eye than even own an xbox. There's not much more I can say about a system with only 3 different letters in it's name and controller that feels like an iron maiden. Oh yea, and buy the way the only reason that their online is any good is because the system is made by a company that builds computers. Of course writing this review is a waste of time because xbox owners and people who would consider buying an xbox can't read anyway.\n",
      "This system is completely worthless. I'll start with the hardware itself: IT DOESN'T WORK. The hard drive is not nearly as effective at storing information as normal memory cards; in fact, it often decided to erase my save files on a whim. I have never had this problem with a PS2 or GameCube.But this problem pales in comparison to the paltry game lineup. Let's face the facts: Unless your gaming palate consists entirely of generic action games, licensed garbage, and \"edgy\", \"adult\" titles, you will be bored out of your mind with this thing. Oh sure, it purports to have \"RPGs\" in the form of trash like Fable, Jade Empire, and KOTOR, but these are just more generic action games dressed up in RPG clothing.Oh, and news flash: Pretty graphics can only numb your brain to the pain of mangled game design for so long. Once you wake from the \"Ooooh it looks so good\" stupor, you will realize that you are wasting your time.As for me, I found one single game that was halfway decent on this console, and even then, it was a game that also appeared on other systems. And still worse, halfway through it the XBox erased my data. Yippee.Unless you are (a. brain-dead, (b. addicted to violence and \"mature\" content, or (c. clueless as to what a good game consists of, skip this clump of dung and buy a PS2. Or even better, a GameCube. A sweet, decadent, purply GameCube. Ahhh, bliss.\n",
      "I've had my xbox for barely five months and it just stopped working.  Bestbuy left me on hold for 28 minutes and microsoft tells me I can spend [$$] to have it serviced or spend another [$$] to buy a brand new one.  90 day warranty my a#+!  it's a great system, but my recommendation would be to get the extended warranty.* My girlfriend bought me another xbox and that one also broke.  this time after 4 months.  luckily we had the extended warranty.  maybe i just have bad luck but it's been really irritating.\n",
      "I guess xbox is ok. I know a lot of you are like drooling over it but Im not anymore.The goods-Graphics are nice-halos fun-online play-Is very fun wit friendsThe bads-very small selection of games-graphics are no better (some games are terrible!)-Sound is no better-Is very bulky and delicate-Defective ones were reliesed the whole first year-selling a 100 dollar machine for 300 (now is 150)-your just buying a cpu so whats the big deal about xbox live?-xbox live charges an arm and a leg.just get internet access-controllers are friggen huge and annoying. The small ones are  to spendy-stuck playing the same old games over and over and OVER again-constantly screwing up on me tooWell I rest my case. Xbox sucks. Its good for a few things and thats it. dont blow your money.\n",
      "This game had many faults in my opinion. There was almost no storyline. You could talk to characters to play minigames, solve puzzles and problems, and move to new areas, and although they gave you a necessary collectible item, they had no affect on events in the storyline. In fact, only Hunter, Spyro, Sparx, Professor, and Red had any effect on the main storyline. Only Spyro, Professor, and Red would be considered main characters. As for the actual characters, about seventy-five percent or more had annoying voices, comments, characteristics, speech, ways of talking, mini games, puzzles and problems, and tasks. Some had five out of seven annoyances. It made you not want to even bother listening to most the characters. The mini games were usually terrible. With Sparx you had to avoid getting squashed, crushed, eaten, run over, or attacked more than three times. You had about three weapons, but usually only the standard weapon was useful. You could speed up or slow down, but only temporarily. The last Sparx games were easier than the first ones since all you had to do was shoot and dodge enemies instead of also avoiding obstacles and opening doors in addition to fighting. Blink's mini games were also boring, since basically you either shot, squashed, tackled, or bombed enemies. Most could be shot far away by zooming in, so the only challenges were making sure you didn't get to close to some enemies, jumping at the right time for something to land or grab on to, and having bombs left over to destroy the dark gems. St. Byrd mini games were a little better, though not much. Basically, you used bombs and missiles to destroy enemies who often couldn't fight back, and either targets or cannons. You also flew through gates and hoops. Spyro's mini game was the worst, if that is possible. You aimed and fired at a certain amount of enemies before they killed, passed, or stole from you. Hunter's game play was okay, but usually you could zoom and shoot enemies before they knew you were there, so the main obstacle was not falling off a cliff or getting knocked off one by an obstacle. Spyro's adventure mode was fun since you could use electric, fire, water, and ice breath and bombs, charge, and horn dive enemies while gliding, jumping, or running to defeat enemies. Environments were varied and skills could be learned from elders. Some of the puzzles were boring, but for most part, playing Spyro or one of the other two dragons was fun. Objective is to destroy dark gems and collect eggs and light gems throughout game. Overall, Spyro was fun, mini games were boring, most characters were annoying in one way or another, and the storyline was too short and silly. If you want Spyro with more action(combat), realistic graphics, good characters and storyline, and no mini games, try the legend of spyro trilogy. It focuses more on fighting, than exploration and puzzles, but is much better(especially for kids older than ten or younger kids who like action without blood).\n",
      "Despite the unsatisfied reviews of some people I am going to buy this game anyway. Mainly because I love Spyro and I want to own all the Spyro games. I just wish the Spyro Season of Fire and Spyro season of Ice were available for the PS2 format instead of just Gameboy!  :(\n",
      "I grew up on Spyro. I played every other game in the series and when this one came out I was reall excited. I never even finished it. Why? Because maybe 3/4 or less of the way through I came to the conclusion that the game was terrible. I was about 10 at the time and this was the first title I ever sold back to gamestop and never regretted my decision. Hero's tail was my last spyro game and in my opinion it's where Spyro's fate was sealed and I got off the ride. This game is barely a shadow of what Spyro is supposed to be. It's not even a so different it can be fun sort of change, it's a it's so different it's a forgettable mess that killed the Spyro franchise sort of change. This is the sonic 06 of spyro.\n",
      "I have been a fan of this series ever since I picked up the first one with my brand new Playstation in 1996.  It always seemed to know its place in life as a bridge between old 2D platform games and the present.  It used the new technology to update platforming with humor and attitude of the characters along with great sound effects and background music.  In this title, whatever they've done with all these elements just doesn't add up to the same charming experience as previous outings.Movement in one general direction collecting objects is gone and replaced with a free roaming enviornment.  I didn't see very good clues telling you what you are supposed to doing or going next.  The 3D environment makes it challenging to perform the classic crash moves of spinning or bouncing on top of enemies with accuracy although I suppose you might get used to that over time.It is really easy to die in this game, and it took us 3 or 4 attempts to get past the first level. At first I sort of liked the music but after roaming around trying to figure out where to go the music got irritating and seemed to loop pretty often.  The graphics are attractive, but are missing the previous version's style & polish.  In the previous titles, Crash was very expressive and you could see a sort of dumb look on his face.  That type of thing seems to be missing in Twinsanity.  Even collecting the fruit is less fun, the satisfying slurppy sound is gone and the fruit doesn't always fly across the screen into your fruit count.To sum up, with all the great platform games out there, there is just no reason to buy this one, especially at full price.  Pick up Jax II or Rachet & Clank Going Commando (or both) off the Greatest Hits shelf.\n",
      "This is the very first MMORPG I have tried.  After playing it for a month, I am definitely not impressed.  I knew about the monthly fee and read many differing reviews so I decided to give this game a go.  The character customization is the only thing I really enjoyed.  Afterwards, the sheer amount of just running around and clicking the same buttons over and over again just to attack, attack, attack.  What this game seriously needs is something besides talking to an npc or attacking.  The incredible amount of time it takes to level up and complete later missions of just fighting, fighting, fighting made me truly ask myself: why is this worth $15.00 a month?  I could get more fun out of the original Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy.  I would only recommend this to a person who is both a true comic book and MMORPG fan.\n",
      "I bought the game.There was a bad disk.12 hours later i had a website to download the whole game from.That 12 hour wait was the longest I've had from a CSR since.The game does what it says it will and more.  You become a hero fighting villains and interacting with a huge community online. You get to create your hero from scratch.  While every power that might cause a trademark infringement is not in the game, you should easily make a hero that fits -you- and what you want and then dress them as you like.The first major FREE content release is here, after a series of minor patches and tweaks and additions. Now costume options are even more profound.  There is more to do for those who spend 12 ours a day playing this game (I'm not one of them so I'm still taking my sweet time and enjoying the game) and got bored rapidly. There is a lot more for folks like me for when I do finally make my hero strong enough to face the new dangers added.Botoom line: They added a lot.  More is going to happen this fall.  Next year they release the villain side of you to play.  Over two hundred thousand players, active communities, and lots of fun.  Check out the website before you buy if you have any doubts.You need:A mid end machine, with a decent graphics card.A high speed internet connection.  Your AOL dialup is usable but will prolly leave you frustrated.Time.  Just take time spent watching TV and turn it into playing this and you might avoid getting divorced.The Game is suitable for teens. The content folks and CSR's vigorously enforce any violations. There is a profanity filter on as a default at start.  The chat window can be closed for the unsupervised very young.Play the super hero you have inside you and make some new friends online.\n",
      "People starting the game fresh will eventually come to despise it (or rather the developers) as much as the legions of veterans who've quit.You see, every few months the developers \"rebalance\" their \"vision\" which typically results in massive changes to characters that players have spent months and months playing. For some, they can re-spec (a process in which the developers  admit that they've screwed up the game so much people need to re-do their characters), while for others the changes are so severe and ill-planned that their characters are rendered completely useless.I still have a level 50 Electricity/Electricity Blaster that is completely unplayable under last fall's \"fix.\" And that happened after the developers promised no major changes which convinced me to pony up a few more months of fees. Never going to make that mistake again.I strongly urge people looking for a well-designed MMO experience to try World of Warcraft, at least until the Marvel superhero MMO is released. City of Heroes/Villains is simply not worth it. The server populations are shadows of their former selves, and even the new players who didn't experience what the game used to be will eventually be burned by the developers.They're crooks who constantly nerf player powers to try to slow progress and wring more money out of their customers. Not to be trusted.I can't believe I just wrote that. But it's true. The developers just abused the community trust too many times with lies, arrogance and clumsiness. Stay far, far away from City of Heroes.\n",

      "It should be called MCP instead of MVP. I played 1 and 1/3 inning it was enough for me. Everytime I made contact it was a soft roller to 2nd, three straight times the same result. I got one out pitching, with a system that looked like making kick offs, which is difficult to master, how about doing it over 100 times? Three pitches one out, one Double and one Home Run I had enough. Graphics and player models look great, but it's no fun if you can't play the game with out being a hardcore game. Anyway Baseball has become so bad of lately, why spend 50 bucks in this game when there are better sports or action games less complicated specially if you don't have time to spare in order to play a video game.\n",
      "So I sit here playing my xbox and I glance at the SVC:Chaos game box and I wonder, \"why did I buy that game??\" Ladies and Gentle men this will be a very short review,this game is GARBAGE!! I am a long standing 2d game fan and SNK is almost the lone survivor of the 2d age. So it saddens me when they release a game like this which is such an obvious rushed and uncared for release just to satisfy contractual demands they had with Capcom. LOW RES graphics and I mean sub par neo geo graphics....sound is even worse.Skip it...buy Capcom vs Snk: EO 2...muuucchh better better everything... SNK really dropped the ball...after playing Guilty Gear this game jus would not cut it\n",
      "This game was so bad, and left so much to be desired, that I, someone who never writes reviews, was compelled to write one, just to keep other people from buying it, and ultimately further rewarding an extremely subpar release.  The game play is horrible.  The graphics are sloppy.  The animation is unfathomably choppy (the frames per second are very very low,  maybe they could've gotten away with this 10 years ago on Nintendo version 1 or something).  If you're expecting anything like arcade gameplay, look elsewhere.  This was something that was dished out to the public to make a few bucks, and not much more.  Quality and effort just weren't put into this game.Blah, wasted money.\n",
      "I think that this Call of Duty was to hard and the gameplay was to slow. I didn't enjoy this game. I didn't have fun while playing this Call of Duty. I struggling to keep alive and make my objectives. Too hard for me atleast. Rent before buying this one, or play call of duty 2 big red one if you have just the original xbox and your looking for a call of duty.\n",
      "Activision should've reconsidered before hiring a game company like Spark Limited to ruin a whole epic. Why couldn't they hire Infinity Ward?If you are a Call Of Duty crazer, avoid this. This game is more like designed by an un-skillful ametur company. Even if you see a teaser trailer of the actual game footage, they create a diversion to gimmick. The intro movie in the game has got nothing to do with the game at all.Good things:None.Bad things:Plenty you'll find them in Call Of Duty: Fines Hour. The modelling and graphics are rushed, and a few number of weapons are missing from the PC version - weapons omitted from the release like the MP44, and all the pistols are gone, and only one rocket launcher which is the Panzershrek. All the classic weapons from the original PC release isn't included.Next downside point..tight aiming. The feel of the weapon your holding is absolutely a shocker. You can't even aim correctly at a far German - it will move too fast causing you to waste time and get asassinated. Comparing this to the PC version, aiming with the mouse is easier to use.Why can't we not forget? Saving during missions. Guess what, there is no saving ability during missions and you can only save after a mission. PC Call of Duty has a in-mission saving ability, incase if you get stuck on something. Finest Hour doesn't - every time you die, you have to start sorrowly from the beginning all over again (back to square one), and builds up frustration.Thirdly is the looping music. Ripped from the MP3 music from the PC version, but causes continuous looping at a point. Michael Giacchino deserves better than this.And yes, it takes forever bloody hits to finally kill a German and it's unrealistic. If you shoot an enemy in the head on the PC Call of Duty then the enemy dies instantly. You won't see it happen on Finest Hour.So sad, Spark Unlimited, get to learn how to program games, so sad.\n",
      "This game is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics look like yur playing on ps2 and the AI is really stupid. The commercials made this game look awsome but it is know where near awsome. [...]\n",
      "I played this game for 4-5 hours with my 8-year old son and it was unbelievably frustrating. I've never played a game before with such horribly designed levels, where you fight your way through hordes of bad guys for 2 hours only to find yourself facing a bridge and the WRONG X-Man character to get across it, so you have to start all over at a long-gone save where that particular character is still alive, and someone manage to keep him/her alive long enough to reach the bridge. The camera view is horrible, so that you can only see about 10 feet in front of your characters. There is no way to heal your most vulnerable characters because there are woefully few health drops.  The A.I. controlled X-men characters are so freaking stupid that they'll walk right off a cliff and die, which means you have to constantly switch from your favorite char to one of the idiot A.I. chars to get them in the right place, and they constantly get stuck and are too stupid to jump over little obstacles to keep up with you.  This game is fun when it works, which is only really when you're playing solo or 2-player co-op, when you don't have to deal with the stupid A.I. Overally, I became so frustrated and angry while playing this game that I had to shut it off. Only an X-men fan would give this a 5-star rating because the game levels are a confusing mess, the A.I. is stupid, there are no clues for solving puzzles (like crossing damaged bridges), and you have to use a specific X-men character to solve certain parts of the game, with no warning in advance, and that char probably will die before you reach it. Horrible, horrible game. The only game I've played that's worse than this is TMNT for Xbox, and I play about 100 games per year.\n",
      "Its nice to rent if you are saving up for a good game. I wouldn't invest in this game as the graphics are cartoony.

Save your dough for a good game and rent this on a rainy day!!!!!!\n",

And the company's technical support doesn't know anything at all about their product.  I let them know what is wrong, give them crash logs, everything...and they still can't figure it out.  It got to the point where I gave the game to my friend and I just play it at his house all the time now.  Don't get unless you know EXACTLY that it is going to work.\n",

      "THIS IS THE WORST MARIO GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's to easy to beat and it's boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "So... Mario vs Donkey Kong. Nintendo's latest shameless capitalization of a once-venerable series of games. I bit the bullet and started playing this recently, curiosity winning out over the recent experiences with Mario-branded games. Despite such tragedies of game design of the last 10 years like Mario Sunshine and Wario World, I still harbor warm feelings for the Mario games of the late 20th century, forgetting time and again that as their management and lead designers age and stagnate, fun, clever, original games like those are seemingly forever in Nintendo's past.The game started out alright, an interesting puzzle-focused twist on the main-sequence Super Mario series... they eliminated the venerable stomping-enemies-and-grabbing-power-ups formula, and replaced it entirely with simple logic puzzles in underwhelming levels usually no larger than two screens' worth. You can still jump around, but Mario's jumping range is no higher than about twice his height, which for Mario is absolutely pathetic. He also moves at a constant rate of speed no matter how long he's been running, making nimble jumps practically impossible, and skids randomly when he stops; I found myself constantly plunging into crevasses and falling off cliffs, wondering with utterly genuine surprise and confusion why the character was receiving commands I wasn't inputting. Probably the biggest sin of all, though, is the ludicrously short distance he can fall before pancaking on the ground and whining like a toddler. And if you're falling while holding something, he'll pitch the item across the screen once you've fallen a certain distance, forcing you to retrieve it once he's done feeling sorry for himself.Also, Mario's got the same voice actor they've been using in Mario games for years, Charles Martinet, who produces an entirely testicle-free whiny broken falsetto soaked in an Italian accent that rings less authentically than a Wichita Godfather's Pizza commercial. After maybe 20 minutes of gameplay, I was nearly in tears, begging the gods of video games to make him shut up... even if you're Mother Teresa, you can only really hear that \"Mama Mia!\" croon a limited number of times before a primal urge to exterminate mankind kicks in. And god help you if you let the rescued mini-Marios fall off the screen on the Mini Mario levels: until you retrieve all of them, which can sometimes take a while, they'll continuously shriek \"Oh, Mario!\" every second or so like starving lupine infants, producing a sensation that I can only describe as cannibalistic rage mixed with crippling nausea. One of the biggest letdowns in the game is the inability to pitch these mewling little parasites into an active caldera, forever silencing their demonic little voices.Donkey Kong himself is probably the strangest part of the game, though. During the opening cinematic, we see DK sitting on his fat simian butt in his house, flipping idly through channels, until he sees a commercial advertising some kind of weird mini Mario dolls. Then, suddenly, hearts appear in DK's eyes. I am not making this up. It appears to anyone with more than one digit in their age that Donkey Kong is either harboring a secret lust for everyone's favorite effeminate plumber, or has a sick fetish for plushie toys. The latter becomes evident as we see DK break into the factory and steal one sack full of mini-Marios, crippling the entire toy doll industry. Apparently in their panic, the ubiquitous, androgenous little toadstool slaves forgot they could just turn the machines back on and... uh, you know.... just, uh, make more. Instead, Mario comes to the rescue and follows DK through six worlds of improbable puzzles, rescuing one mini Mario on every level.So yeah, yet another failed opportunity to restore the Mario franchise to some mote of its former glory.  I'm sure Nintendo won't care as it'll still undoubtedly make them money, but it's yet another shovel working to dig their corporate grave.\n",
      "I absolutely loved the original \"Rise of Nations\".  Fantastic RTS game.  Also extremely stable; this will be important in a moment.  I \"upgraded\" to this expansion after about 6 months of Rise of Nations.  It immediately transformed my gaming experience from one of delight in a deep, complex, and endlessly replayable RTS game into one of unbridled frustration.  The expansion causes the game to crash constantly and without warning (although I often get an amazingly helpful \"Exception!\" window afterwards).  It crashes during loading.  It crashes during saving.  It crashes at the start of the game.  It crashes 3 hours into a game.  It crashes when 100 units are fighting.  It crashes when a single peasant is walking.  It will even, in something I've never seen before, crash in the middle of crashing.  It is without doubt the least stable game or expansion I have ever played, and I've played Temple of Elemental Evil.  I regret the day I bought this expansion because it has so colored my view of the game that I don't even like playing the original anymore because I half expect it to die with every move.  The nominal benefits of the expansion (4 new nations, a few new campaigns, and tweaks to some old nations) are SLIGHTLY outweighed by the fact that you have no chance in hell of playing or finishing any of them.  Avoid this expansion at all costs.\n",
      "First of all this game is pretty fun to play even though the voice acting is a bit cheesy. Great Character Dev, nice pocket universes to visit and such, but I agree with the previous reviewer talking about Starforce. I went to the website to check out what in heck it was and my PC was left alone until I came on the particular topic in thier discussion forum and then my Privacy settings warning message came up meaning that if you even got to the FAQ you get bombarded with B.S. I volunteerely installed the demo(Which by the way also uses starforce) and have had no problems but that doesn't mean YOU won't have problems. I warn you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is good but not worth it to puke up your system. I was waiting to save up enought to buy until I read that reveiw and then went to the very site)Larian) and found out that thier was indeed such a program that installs and that it can cause reboots and other system problems on some people's systems. I don't normally believe what I read, but I reaserched it and found that it is not mentioned in the EULA at all. SOme idiots on the Larian forum said that they would have to mention every file installed, not so, just the significant ones. I think this &quot;driver&quot; should be mentioned. Doesn't anyone have any common sense anymore! I have no problems on my system(yet) but out of Principle, I am not going to buy this game and encourage more violations to my freedom in future games such as &quot;phoning home&quot; and paying a fee everytime I load the game! It's just a silly game and not worth it!\n",
      "I didn't know a game company could install a program/drivers onto my computer without informing me. And, the only way to uninstall the program/drivers is to get the removal program from the game company site = it's not even included on the cd/game ?. Talk about shady and underhanded tactics. I refuse to allow anyone to have access to my computer, so this game is being returned. With so many worthy games available, I'm not going to add to what hopefully doesn't become the industry standard: \"if you want to play our game, we must have access to your computer\". The risk just doesn't outweigh the reward !\n",
      "Fans of the survival horror gaming genre were no doubt excited by unraveling the mystery of Sirens errie Japanese town with the terrifying past. Sadly, the premise is about as exciting as the game gets.The ProsThis game is a really gorgeous visual treat. The chracters are rendered with a new technolgy that actually wraps realistic images onto 3d computerized planes.The setting has been developed well. The village of Hanuda is a scary place cast in eternal darkness surrounded by a sea of blood and of course the Siren going off in the background.The Cons (and there are many)The game developers dubbed the game with a British voice over crew which in the beginning is comical but after awhile just feels ridiculous. For some people this may not be an issue at all but for me it just seemed distracting playing a Japanese guy and to hear him shout \"Oi Mate! wait up!\"Secondly, the gameplay is terribly limited and re-do's abound. More skilled gamers may not have to replay missions as much but I found it hard not to be killed as 80% of the time your only defense is to run and hide. The game employs a drop down menu to issue command to your character. The menu is easy to use but truly annoying. A good example occurs on the first mission. Your goal is to escape a bad guy via car. The drop down menu asks you 1) Would you like to pick up the car key? 2) Would you like get in the car? 3) Put key in ignition? 4) Turn key to start car?- truly gets to be cumbersome to game play.Lastly, the game uses a event system/ time table for you to keep track of events as they happen to all 10 playable chracters. While that sounds convoluted in itself it only gets worse that you have to play all ten characters and not one at a time. The game is broken up into missions. For example,one mission may involve a journalist and reveal certian parts of the mystery and these events are recorded on the time table. The next mission you are introduced to a new character and complete the next mission and learn more. You must refer back to the time table to try and piece it all together.Siren was a truly exciting idea thta really failed to deliver. I don't feel many people actually completed as I myself grew bored and gave up halfway through. If you truly want to be scared and enetertained I recommend Fatal Frame 1 or 2 as both are in my opinion the best (and scariest) the genre has to offer.\n",
      "How can you have a game where all the characters are Japanese, the setting is Japan, and yet have all the characters speak in U.K. English with U.K. accents? Talk about spoiling a great thing. Siren 2 is supposed to be on the horizon, and hopefully the game's makers will come to their senses and include the Japanese audio track for all releases. It could have been right up there with Silent Hill, but instead the realism, and thus the intensity and scary factor, is lessened because of the lack of a Japanese audio track, which could have been easily included since this game was released in Japan with such an audio track. Those responsible for releasing this in America must have made a major mental lapse -- I hope so, because if they actually sat down and thought of some \"reasons\" to not include the original language track, then there's simply no excuse, no justification. Ridiculous, just plain ridiculous.\n",
      "It's a Star Wars game, but it's a pretty bad one. Ok, the graphics look awesome, as a multi-player game I could see this being good. Single player mode can have two extreems, easy or hard. Those aren't selectable settings, but the way you choose to play. At each \"level\" your character becomes immediately involved in a large battle, your character is one of many fighting this battle and there are no specific goals other than taking over command post. You can elect to piloting ships, steal an AT-AT etc.. but this really only serves to bring  a loose bit of freedom. It makes the game a giant mush without any order to it. You can fall back and let the computer controlled team mates win the level for you or you can engage in combat and (usually) be destroyed almost immediately. Bottom line, this is a poor game. One of the worst Star Wars games ever made. Save your money.\n",
      "I thought this game would be awesome based on the reviews but it sucks. The graphics are blurry and pixelated.I have an awesome HDTV so no it's not my screen. Very disappointed.\n",
      "The battles in this  game are kind of short, and, what's worse, winning them  doesn't depend on the level of player participation!  As one reviewer noted, you can win many battles  in this  game by killing one enemy, or none at all.  Maybe it's different with online play, but I've not ventured into that arena yet, and have no plans to in the future.The graphics are much like the CGI of most George Lucas films; they're kinda pretty and also kinda plastic and dull.  The same goes for the sound effects.  The laser blasts sound... well they don't have that much \"ump.\"  Also noted by one reviewer, the player isn't at the center of the action in this game.  It's just an all around dull experience; I won't be renting the sequel.\n",
      "My first piece of advise - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL AN OFFICIAL PATCH IS RELEASED! ((I am not the only person saying this))Even then you should be leery until maybe a 2nd patch is out! This game is LOADED with bugs, the graphics engine consumes your CPU and RAM no matter how powerful your system is! Please read on - I don't hate this game...I just think they should have tested it before releasing it to the public.There are many fansites with forums. In the forums you will find people screaming and yelling from the rooftops about how bad, buggy and choppy this game is!Let me make myself clear and explain what I mean by BETA for those that do not know.When a software company creates a program it typically goes through several stages before being released. BETA is a version that is ALMOST ready for sale to the public but needs to go through test drives first to hunt and find problems, crashes, bugs, mistakes, etc. This version would not be sold or released to the public for widespread use. NO WAY!A release that is ready for widespread public use or sale is called a GOLD or RTM version. This means that it runs beautifully, very few bugs or crash problems, if any!WELL, Vampires: Bloodlines is NOTHING BUT A BETA!!!!!!!! I can prove it. Keep reading!I have a P4, ATI X800, 2 GB CORSAIR RAM....etc. You name it, I have nothing but top of the line, latest and greatest.This game chugs along. It consumes over 750 MB's of RAM when being run, I get choppy frames, and lots of lag at times!How can this be? Easy, this game was not meant to be released so soon. I think there was pressure to get it out before X-mas!!!! The code and graphics engine behind this game was not ready for retail release.Bloodlines crashes at certain parts of the game, lip sync is off on many characters, some missions of the game cannot be completed, graphics errors and goof ups abound while playing the game, the combat action is TERRIBLE, involuntary switching from 1st to 3rd person disrupts your game play!! I could go on and on!The GOOD -Diverse campaigns/missions, funny interaction with characters, some interesting weapons to use, very creative game with clever ideas and lots of thought put into the concept.The BAD -Missions become repetitive, lots of level transitions that TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD!!!!! Lot's of talking about meaningless things with characters. It almost seems like they added this crap just to keep you busy! The graphics are nice but the characters are stiff and unrealistic looking.The UGLY -Parts of game cannot be completed successfully, parts of game cause you to crash to desktop, there is an unofficial patch but it does not work under many circumstances, slow load times, choppy framerates, music and voice sync is off in many situations. The worst part is the collision detection part of the graphics engine. (Translation -You can be stopped dead in your tracks by a measely drinking cup or piece of chair on the floor while just walking, but worst of all while being shot at or chased!!! Talk about ruining the gameplay experience!!!)This game was not ready for primetime and should never have been released so soon. I think this game will be a good game once an official patch or two have been released and proven successful.Don't buy this game until these issues have been resolved. TRUST ME ON THIS!!!!!!\n",
      "this game was to short I beat it in 4 hrs.thats why I gave it 1 star for overall.3 stars for the funess because it was kind of fun.\n",
      "Game sucked, just didn't like it. The first problem I experienced with this game as the key code wouldn't work. After getting a third code it worked. However the game play sucked, just couldn't get n2 the game. Wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Dont buy this game because it doesnt work on Windows 7 even though Microsoft's website clearly states the game is compatible and should work with no problems.\n",
      "This is another game from this manufacturer that refuses to play straight from the box.  I have a system that exceeds the minimum requirements and a video card that it says works fine with the game.  However, the game refuses to work, just the incompatible card message pops up all the time.  No matter what additional drivers are installed or additional tweaking...it matters not.  These people should be sued for poor performance.  Let the buyer beware.\n",
      "I had high expectations for this game.  I played the single player demo and the multiplayer demo - both worked fine on my nearly brand new system (P4-3Ghz - 1GB Ram, Radeon 9600XT 256MB, XP SP2).  However, I installed my purchased copy, only to encounter some Firewall VBscript error at the end of installation, and then when attempting to play the game, it cannot find the installation CD1 disk.  I attempted to install the game on my second PC and encountered the same error.  So, I returned my copy to Amazon and requested an exchange for another copy since I suspected maybe the disk was damaged.  I received my 2nd copy only 2 days later (great return process Amazon!), reinstalled the game, and again had the same error.  I have a Lite-On LDW-851S DVD/CD-RW combo drive and updated the firmware per information I found on the EA site, but that didn't resolve anything.  I haven't had any other compatibility problems with other games (ex UT2004) and this drive, or with the drive itself so it must be something with the game.  I guess I'll have to go back to Call Of Duty for my WWII genre action gaming.\n",
      "I loved Medal of Honor on the Xbox/PS2, so I thought I would give this a chance.  As an experienced gamer, I had high expectations for this game.  Big mistake.  Took forever to install, and the load times are horrendous.  I start playing the game, and I get to a part where I need to rescue a wounded soldier.  I can't even get through the doors below deck because of the fires, and everytime I attempted it, the guy I was trying to rescue was burned to death.This game is terrible, not what I expected.  I uninstalled it and got rid of it.  I do not recommend this game to anyone except diehard military fans.\n",
      "The seller was buynowlv. I paid 9 bucks. It worked fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3.I took a chance on this game based on what I read about it, and based on the good reviews.It's about mobsters, cops/robbers, and organized crime; so, you can expect scenes with drugs, prostitutes, etc. I thought the game was dark/gloomy.An example of gameplay:Open a door and there are mobsters to kill; kill them.  Then go around a corner...same thing. Over & over again. I thought it was boring, and I stopped playing after an hour or so.I would rather replay a game that I previously enjoyed than play this game for the first time. Before you buy this one, check-out some of the gameplay videos on youtube.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections\n",
      "Midway has officially changed the title lineup on this collection, show your anger and write them a bad review!!!!THEY REMOVED STUN RUNNER, STEEL TALONS, and the original MORTAL COMBAT....Once again, the only way to play STUN RUNNER at home LEGALLY, NO MAME, is to buy an Arcade JAMMA, or the only console version, which is pretty good, ATARI LYNX...\n",
      "Before I start this review I want to say a few things. I am a LONG time gamer, I have lots of love for all genres especially JRPGs and I am fairly lenient on games. I try to find enjoyment in games that are simply un-enjoyable or have many issues. However I am sorry to say that Fable: The Lost Chapter brings a new definition to the term \"Garbage.\" It is simply the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Now I will tell you why:Story - It blows. It is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable. It is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil. Nothing more, and nothing less. I'm fine with that, but the way the story presents itself is dreadful.Voice Acting - Atrocious Crap. A 5 year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this. It is unbelievable in every sense of the word. The characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoying.Music - Nothing memorable at all. I know you don't have Nobuo Uem, or Tsuyoshi Sekito but damn not one good track at all?Gameplay - It's bad. You will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell. The good/bad system in the game is flawed beyond belief. I know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game FORCES you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible. The entire system is unnecessary if you can't choose.Technical Issues - Loads of them. There is pop-in, screen tearing, freezing, and many other various glitches in the game. My favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well (The Last Remnant) but at least it had good VA, Story, Gameplay, and AMAZING music.I know this is coming off as a HUGE rant and I don't mean to offend any of the Fable fans. However I was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them. I am just ashamed that I spent 12 dollars on this and I bought the 2nd one as well which I am just horrified to open.I'm sorry Peter M, but if your other games are as bad as this one I will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game. If you like WRPGs I would recommend that you borrow this from a friend or rent it first so you don't take a leap of faith like I did.Rating 1/5 Abysmal\n",
      "Okay, whether you have high expectations or none at all, this game just doesn't work. For one, the whole \"freedom of choice\" thing is a huge lie. If you want to be \"good\", you can rescue the same people over and over; for \"evil\", you kill them repeatedly. That's it. Second, you CANNOT choose where you want to go and what you want to do there. This game is mission-based, just like every other bland game this year. Oh, sure, you can \"choose\" which mission you want, but if you choose any but the \"right\" one, you'll find yourself getting killed in an instant. So no matter what you do, you have to follow a linear path.The gameplay is a mess as well. The combat system doesn't work half the time (you'll often accidentally target people instead of enemies), and even when it does work, you'll still get killed because your skills aren't powerful enough. How do you get them more powerful? By going to the forest and killing bees until you level up. Hmmm, where have I heard this before? In every single other RPG to hit the market, perhaps? Unlike better games, where you always find yourself at the right level to move forward if you take on all the available enemies, Fable forces you to go back and forth between areas to get the enemies to respawn, watching a long loading screen each and every time you exit and enter an area. What fun.Even the non-combat interface is completely dilapidated. Menus were a monster to navigate, and it took me a good ten minutes just to get my equipment on. And don't get me started on my attempt to use the controller customization feature.Finally, there are the things that aren't \"broken\" exactly, but are still annoying. Like the people, for example. Even when you are just walking through an area, perhaps on your way back to kill more bees, NPCs are constantly chattering away in irritating accents. You can't get a moment's peace. Also, you can call me a prude if you wish, but I can't believe that \"burp\" and \"fart\" have their own buttons. This game is rated M for mature, but perhaps it should be rated I for immature.Overall, Fable is an annoying, clunky, and frustrating game. Far from the promised revoloution, it delivers a package that doesn't even meet mediocre standards.\n",
      "\"Over-Hyped\" is not the word I'm thinking of.  \"Rip-off\" is more accurate.  This game had so much potential, but falls flat in every way.  While the new revolution in third-person point-of-view camera work makes you never want to go back to Baldur's Gate, the blatant false advertising that proceeded the release makes a case for Class Action lawsuit.  The trailer that is shown on Cinematech has NOTHING to do with the game.  There definitely wasn't any consequence for my actions as the makers would have you believe.  Good or evil made no difference except  you get a halo or horns.  Big Whoop.  And don't even get me started about the confining story line and the whole two minutes in took to beat the final boss and take the game back to EB.Lame, lame, lame.  The makers should be ashamed.Rent it if you must.  But resist the urge to snap the disc in half at the end.\n",
      "Of course it has now turned the M rated game into A for Adult for specific reasons. Shooting innoncent people for no reason...doing missions like having sex with girls...hijacking cars...killing and killing over and over. Okay, so you pretty much get my idea of all of the violence. But what most of you want to know is the gameplay. It does have many glitches and although driving in a car can be...fun, all of the gameplay is boring, and not good at all. Want something good to teach your kids...what about E rated games like Kingdom Hearts or Katamari Damacy. But oh my gosh, stay away from this game. Waste you own money and time if you have the guts too.\n",
      "despite the claims that this game would be so much more everything than other gta games, it's just more of the same with a few added tricks (like swimming, etc.).the worst thing about this game is the frustrating missions. when you get to the 'first date' missions you'll see. you have to drive 20 minutes to get there (there is nowhere to save within miles and miles), then you might chase the guys (1 of the 4 missions) for 10 minutes then some car might pull out and crash you.....and then you get \"sorry they got away.\" after some sh%$ like this happens a couple of times and you waste hours just getting back to square one you'll be tired of this cr&@ like i am. i deleted this game off of my memory card and i was happy to do it.avoid!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Well this is a wonderfull game! It teaches people that it is fun to run around with automatic weapons and shoot people for no apparent reason! The first thing that I see is a bunch of corrupt cops mug your character and take his money and then beat him. I can barely stand to look at this game because it is so sinful. I was watching a friend play this and he pulls out two sub machine guns and gun down a man on a motercycle just for the bike! He then goes on the road and shoot at cars while the people are inside. This game was banned in Australia for crying out loud. You can even get prostitutes and use them for sex and then kill them! I don't understand why it could ever be fun to just go out and kill people, even in a stupid video game like this one. I don't mind any other shooters such as Halo or Call of Duty because your not gunning down innocent people. The few aspects that I do like are changing the radio station on the car and parachuting out of airplanes. Everything else is just sick. This game sucks and all the copies should be destroyed.\n",
      "I don't understand how this game got a \"Best Game\" rating at the Spike TV VG Awards, other than by bribe.My friends and I rented this game, to see if it was as good as its hyped to be.Looks to me like Rockstar did a rush job on this game because the physics suck. How realistic is it for a guy on a biycle to be able to knock over a telephone pole? Or to be able to explode a car by punching it enough times? These guys aren't doing drive-by's, its more like a \"park & shoot.\" And the driving physics also suck worse than Davilex's \"Knight Rider: The Game.\"The worst part of San Andreas is the \"Gangsta DDR\" segment where you press buttons to \"dance\" although you're actually just doing the same boring moves to the same song over and over (Nuttin' But a G-Thang). Snoop Dog musta been stoned outta his mind or paid an arseload of royalty fees for use of his and Dre's songs because I'm sure he's played better games than this one. Or maybe Snoop hasn't even played the game at all and just decided he'd endourse it for no reason.The bottom line is this game sucks. It plays out like a really crappy Urban Gangsta flick and it perpetuates the stereotype that all black people sell drugs, beat hookers, do drive by's on each other and kill cops. Believe it or not there are some really intelligent African Americans out there who have college degrees in medicine and don't speak in ebonics.\n",
      "A few years ago, when I had just recently gotten a PS2, I was super pumped when I got this controller. It was getting great reviews, I found it to be more comfortable than the official Sony controllers, and mine was working flawlessly-- for a few months. The rubber contacts on the buttons are made out of some ridiculously cheap rubber that even the Chinese knockoff makers would probably laugh at, and it was not long before my X button started sticking when it was depressed. For fighting games like Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deception, you NEED lightning fast response from the buttons. One sticky button completely ruins this controller, and eventually all of them will wear out due to the terrible material Logitech uses.I actually considered picking up a Logitech wireless PS3 controller at one point since it uses the same form factor, and hoping that Logitech finally learned their lesson about the crappy material, I figured it would be easy to swap out the rubber contacts from the PS3 controller to restore my PS2 controller better-than-new. However, I learned ahead of time that Logitech uses the same crappy material in the PS3 controllers, and the buttons wear out just as quickly! I will probably never buy a Logitech controller again. My official PS2 controllers still work just fine after many years of making Jak and Daxter jump platforms and doing kombos and fatalities in Mortal Kombat, and that durability is worth putting up with wires for. Logitech's terrible neglect for quality materials ruined what would have otherwise been the ultimate controller for PS2 owners.\n",
      "Like several other people have observed, the buttons on this controller, once depressed, tend to stay that way.  I've had two of these Logitech controllers for my PS2.  On the first one, the R2 button didn't spring back once depressed, which made games that went relied on the R2 nearly impossible to play.  On the second controller, the X and square button started sticking; as other reviewers have said, these are two of the most important buttons on the controller (i.e., broken X and square buttons = no gameplay).  Even if all the other (or most of the) features on the Logitech controller are solid, the inability to play videogames using this input device makes the whole package useless.\n",
      "And what about the graphics????As a strong IY fan, I was looking forward to this game.We  bought it some years ago, and I've just now gotten around to playing it a bit.I say a bit b/c I cannot stand another 30 minutes of it.  Deformed graphics, waaay too much talking thattakes forever, no real action.  Seems geared to the very young kiddie set.  I just can't take this seriously,but I am seriously disappointed.\n",
      "The reason I got this game is because of its overall concept of being able to explore a dangerous zone on earth. As I grew up in Eastern Europe, the atmosphere reminds me at my experience during the communist era.I've played many FPS games and recently finished F.E.A.R, Doom 3, HL2, and Far Cry. The graphics, AI and overall game-play in S.T.A.L.K.E.R are pretty weak compared with any of the games mentioned above. The AI of the enemies is very poor, the game-play is cumbersome as you have to micromanage very many little details, and reading a lot of dialog text is annoying. During play, you will have to spend a large amount of time in inventory.The load times are very slow due to what it seems to be poor caching and memory management. The reason I believe that to be the case is that it even takes a long time to go back to a recent quick-save.The slowness and other bugs I encountered made me apply a patch that was released recently. The new patch broke all my saved games and I had to use a unlimited health trainer to speed up the process and get back to where I was. (wasted about 2 hours)Overall the game play is poor, and the support is terrible.\n",
      "The free-flowing, non-linear gameplay is hamstrung by the fact the game forces you through timed, linear missions, where you will save, restore, restore, restore, restore, kill another mob, repeat the save/restore process, over and over.I have been playing FPS titles since Wolfenstein, and was one of the first people to play Doom while it was still sharewear, and this one is perhaps the most frustrating one I have found--even on novice it is too hard. Part of this is because the maps have bottlenecks where, sadly, you are the one entering into a tight killzone where 5-7 mobs are well hidden and shooting at you. Part of this is becase the mobs are too hard to kill.Maybe the programmers think it is cool to make human opponents that can be shot point-blank in the face with a shotgun--twice--and recover before you can reload your shotgun (which hold two rounds) and shoot you dead. Personally, I don't enjoy fighting AI controlled opponents with infinite ammo and superhuman resilience.Oh, and just to make things even more fun, the mobs you are assisting on the missions tend to all die within the first 3 seconds of battle.Also, I have seen people talk about the RPG-aspects of this game. There are none. If you play all the way through to the end, your character will have the same skills as when you started. And, he will still only be able to carry 50 pounds. While 50 pounds may not sound too bad, remember, you carry loot back to your home base and sell it to make money. Well, since you have to carry around first aid kits, and ammo, and food, and bandages, and 3-4 weps, what that means is if you carry around enough of those items to use on a mission, you are coming back with no loot.Do yourself a favor, borrow a copy from a friend before you buy it. If you like it after trying it, buy a copy. Otherwise, save your money.\n",
      "Like most games the difficulty level is absolutely ridiculous. Need a game that non experts can beat.\n",
      "Let's start with the things I liked:The run down look of the environment, Smart A.I., nice textures and I especially love the PDF map. The appearance of the Human NPC's gives them a G.I. Joe kind of look.Not good:Even after version .0004 it's brutal on your system specs but should run much better on newer mid to high end gaming machine. I was running it on a Pentium 2.4GHz with 1Gb ddr3200 with an x1300 xge AGP card. It stuttered and froze up George Bush at a Kanye West Concert. It was not open ended it was scripted and linear.The unforgivable: No Vehicles?!? Five years in the making should equal at least a skateboard.Way too political. From the Enemy Factions to the Military it felt like I was playing Red Dawn the video game with mutants. What happened to the Stalking? I bought the game for stalking not Call of Duty type action.I had to go on the internet to find out why the game kept giving me a German error code after I tried to start it for the first time.Mine is a relatively old system but I should have never had to boost my Virtual memory to 2gig for the thing to even start.Uninstalled it, chucked it in the closet.\n",
      "...it has no minimul system requirements listed and whether or not the internet is required.  That automatically draws a one star review from me.

(you know, this is probably gonna be a fine game.)\n",
      "First of all I gotta say I'm a fan of the game series. I watched them all on outube when I had a weaker computer. But now that I have a good one, I bought the game to check it out.The game has 6 fix patches(Remember when games didn't need patches?). I installed them and started the game on medium difficulty.The game is very buggy and...wrong! Enemies can see you through bushes, walls, smoke, etc and they shoot you when they shouldn't. They know your position ALL THE TIME. Throw grenades at you and you won't know who killed you. They have infinite ammo as well.Anyway there are tons of bugs and technical bugs. Such a shame. The story is nice and could've been a great game\n",
      "This game takes place in Russia and was written by Russians that have no idea how to write a game. Actually, this is just a sorry excuse for a game. The game is fundamentally flawed-EVEN after it gets patched. And the patches will keep coming.  Don't waste your money.  I would have rated this a negative 4 stars, if I could have.\n",
      "What makes me so upset is that this game had the potential to be one of the best games ever designed.  It is almost like the designers studied every one of the game's finest features and decided to deliberately and utterly make them frustrating and stupid.The biggest game killer for me about this is that the single player game is treated like you are hosting your game as a server, as you often see the \"disconnecting\" and \"synchronizing client\".Save that garbage for Multiplayer.The problem with this is that all the stuff you kill in the game respawns the very next morning, every day, totally destroying and ruining what could have been a satisfying experience with working your way through the game.  The same bandits you kill, over and over keep ressurrecting and attacking you as you pass, even while the corpses of their previous bodies are still laying at their feet.  And of course the unique NPC's if they are killed (And they seem to be pathetic weaklings compared to the respawning bandits and their godlike killing abilities where they can headshot you at 300 meters with a pistol)  do not come back, so if they were a quest turn-in, too bad,  the designers thought that god like, near unkillable respawning bandits was more fun for your immersion.Totally destroyed. Do not buy this wreck.\n",
      "This game isnt that good.  The battle is slow, and i just didnt like it Disagea looks much better get that or another rpg.  Don't waste your money on this game.\n",
      "I wonder if the people who have so far reviewed \"The Bard's Tale\" (PC) on the web actually played it or the demo, or if they are relying on the reputation of previous games with the same name to make a judgment call about this game. I do not believe many did play it, because if they did, they would have seen how frustrating and how little fun the game becomes as it drags on. Yes, the voice acting is funny and enjoyable, but a cute and quirky story cannot make up for the game's overall poor design.During certain animations (and more importantly during battle) the game will slow to a crawl comparable to the lag you might experience playing a newly released MMORPG on a dial-up connection. The slow down is a known problem for users of certain models of GeForce and Radeon cards, but not all users will be affected. As of the date of this review, there is no support for this issue and no official forum for discussion of such tech problems.Don't rely on the game box and screenshots as a judge of the game environment. Basically we are dealing with a slightly modified, old fashioned top-down view with the added bonus of trees and other structures that must become transparent to allow you to see your character as you move under them. Due to the limited field of view, the minimap becomes essential to know what is a few feet away from you, either because you will not be able to actually see monsters until they are practically right on top of you or because they will be obscured if they move under trees that you are not under at the same moment.Yes, you have companions that have cool powers that will be helpful in different situations. But no matter what you do, if you are ganged up on by more than three monsters at once, you may as well give up and load your game. This is because most of the monsters you fight have a tendency to knock you down or stun you for some time when they hit. Basically, if you cannot block perfectly, you will be round-robined to death as you enemy takes turns knocking you down and doing damage to you while you cannot stand up and recover. Meanwhile your companions will do whatever would be most illogical in such a situation: Healers will run forward and fight monsters with their fists, warriors will stop fighting in the middle of a battle and simply stand still, ranged weapon users will fire at monsters offscreen, drawing them into the battle.Forget about the claim \"less A, more I\", the monsters aren't any better than most games...you will simply be overwhelmed with numbers in most cases.Overall, the game is sub par...the price at release is low for a reason.\n",
      "I bought this game, only to find out that it would not work on our PC. If you do not have a T&L vidoe card, it will not run. BE SURE YOUR VIDEO CARD IS A T&L BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I've played vietnam games a lot like Viet Cong, NAM and this one is right up there with them.  good graphics, storyline and weapons....Love the part where planes come in and napalm an area.  The load times are long and no gauge or level to see how much time before gameplay starts....lot of swearing and bad language in the game - but it's a lot of fun!\n",
      "Sierra brought us many wonderful titles over the years, including the Kings Quest, Hero's Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry serials.  In most cases, they did a good job putting together creative, cute, situation driven puzzle games.  Here, they delivered an appalling blend of poor graphics, bad language, and simplistic game play.Gone are interaction with characters, puzzles, and good writing.  Instead, one plays simple 2-D mini-games and views poorly developed cut-scenes.The game is a bizarre blend of exceptionally childish \"humor,\" such as fart jokes and random acts of not-very-clever profanity, coupled with 4 or 5 mini-games so shoddy and simplistic they recall the days of CGA.  Too simple for those over 10, too profane for those under 16, this game would not be worth playing if it were free.  At $50, Sierra sells their reputation and little else.  I will think twice, and read some reviews, before purchasing another Sierra product.\n",
      "Who are these people who review and praise a game that hasn't even come out yet! Yeesh.The reviewer below says that it should be as good as the previous Larry games well there's something you should know.The Leisure Suit Larry series was created by Al Lowe who made every title until he and hundreds others were fired by Sierra.Al Lowe had NO contribution to this title, (Even though Sierra said he would be involved!) this title is the concotion of a third party developer who have never made an adventure game in their life. From previews I've heard the game is alright but it's obvious that is hasn't got the distanct influence Al Lowe gave his games to make them personal and fun. Another critcism I heard is that it relies too much on nostalgia.For what it's worth, I'm not getting the game until Al Lowe gives his apporval. I'd advise fans do the same, but please don't praise a game you haven't played yet...Or is this guy below me a marketing goon?\n",
      "I notice that there's no mention of Al Lowe anywhere from Sierra.  Here's the simple truth - if the genius creator of LSL's 1 - 6 is missing, then this isn't an LSL game at all - just a cheap rip off.Message to pointy-haired bosses at Sierra: You can buy the LSL concept.  You can buy Larry's image.  But if you don't have Al Lowe, you don't have anything.\n",
      "This game will amuse and entertain an inexperienced 12-15 year old kid. So if your not in that age range....skip this game.It is dull, repetitive, uninspired. This game was hyped up to sell you on the concept that it was going to be a baudy, risque' game for adults. Well, there is certainly no nudity. There are certainly no interesting game moments. You spend your time playing skill games equivalent to FROGGER to accumulate points to \"score\" with the targeted female. YAWN!!!!!!!It is brief, dull, pointless. Here is the worst part...the scumbags behind Larry (Sierra- which has been teetering on collapse for years now) are releasing an \"UNCENSORED\" version that includes nudity. So if you already WASTED $30, you will have to do it again! Here's a tip...if you already own LSL,you can download NUDE patches for the game from some of the popular gaming websites that will make it exactly like the uncensored version for FREE!!!!! Just Google it and you'll find it.Save your money. Teach these guys a lesson by not buying this game. Make them pay in GREEN for doing crappy work, hyping a product and trying to steal/waste your money!\n",
      "I bought this game thinking it would be like Star Wars meets Unreal Tournament. Boy was I wrong. I don't care about the pretty graphics or all the vehicles I can drive/fly. This game is just another Battlefield title. I hate the Battlefield series. 0 stars.\n",
      "Hmm ordered it a week ago and they (AMAZON) still haven't shipped it... Hopefully the reason is that they are going to send me a version that works..read online many of the cds are bad... anyhow..if the game is anything like 1942 i'll be happy..however hearing it locks to 20fps on online sounds scary.. oh well... maybe by xmas this will finally ship!\n",
      "I thought this game would be a great one and an improvement over the first EE. Well, not quiet, this EE2 has nothing to offer, the grqphics look like the ones in Age of Empires II (realeased in 1999 I believe). The game runs slow, i have a computer with the following specifications:*Windows XP*Dx 9.0c*Intel Pentium 4 3.06 GHz*2 GB of RAM*256 RAm video cardand yet the game runs slow.I love Empire Earth I because the graphics are good, and the game runs smoothly...This new released now is a major disappointment, and I dont understand why if the graphics are not good. The gaphics of this game look like a paint by an abstract painter.If you have played the first Empire Earth, you will see the difference between EE I and EE II, and you will go back to the first one.Save your money and play EE I ntil these guys come with a real improvement over EE I.\n",
      "What could the game designers have been thinking?  I've been ambivalent about Dynasty Warriors 4 to begin with, but I'd learned to accept its shortcomings.  But in this installment in the series, it's almost like the shortcomings are the only things left.  They took the least fun and most annoying features of Dynasty Warriors 4 and made it the sole purpose for Dynasty Warriors 4:  Empires, and the result is a supremely monotonous and charmless game.First of all, it's as if they felt that the old enemies weren't powerful enough, with their dozens of archers interrupting your every move, ally soldiers who love standing around watching you get pummeled, unlimited Musou (special) attacks for enemy generals, and overlarge maps that take forever to navigate.  Now to add to your misery you have:- Enemy generals who respawn indefinitely;- Enemy troops no longer have to emerge at a gate; they can literally materialize beside you from thin air;- Enemy commanders can pull one six-hit combo that takes half your health;- The player can be infinitely juggled so that you can lose your entire life bar if you fall down just once.  If the computer opponent happens to be behind you, you may as well kiss the fight goodbye;- There's a new type of enemy, the Sorceress, who can shoot endless flame/ice/lightning at you so that you won't be able to get up for about a minute straight;- Special items aren't available every turn; you have to wait for some kind of production schedule;- There's a low limit as to how many generals you can have in your roster;- And no, your characters, items and achievements from Dynasty Warriors 4 don't carry over.The game mechanics have been altered so that now the emphasis isn't on fighting (uh, isn't this a fighting game?), but capturing these annoying \"strongholds\".  And to do that, you have to kill every single enemy within a large radius.  So if one enemy troop hides in a nook from you, you'll have to run around looking for him.  Also, you now have to run from place to place and ignore enemy generals just to capture these strongholds fast enough that your allies don't screw you up in your other locations.  Level after level of this -- it's amazingly dreary.  You can forget about using some of your more eccentric generals; the only characters that matter now are ones with a very long weapon range and crowd-control abilities.  I may have 10 characters available, but the fighting mechanics (and super-cheap computer opponents) mean that I only use two, Xu Huang and Lu Bu.  They may as well have gotten rid of all the other available characters, because trying to use Zhang Jiao or Meng Huo in this game is suicide.The gaming equivalent of an eternal root canal.  Save your money.\n",
      "I think my title and \"K\"'s review says it all. Unless you've played SH games before, and/or are absolutely a survival/demented horror freak DO NOT BUY. RENT IF YOU ARE CURIOUS, then you'll only be disappointed in a small sum of money wasted.I can't believe I wasted forty minutes of my life beated retarded dogs with metal poles. I was hoping it would get better or something, trying to find reason for wasting thirty-odd bucks on it...then a ghost showed up and I said Screw this crap. And I played good games like MK Deception and Burnout 3.People need to get a reality check. Just cause video games are popular now more than ever, new and hyped don't mean good. Old school games like the original MK's, Tekken, old Wolfenstein (for its day), Doom 1 and Rainbow Six were the good stuff. And those arcade fighters, the side scrollers with big guy, the martial artist and the middle man were awesome in their day. And Diablo 2, don't get me started. All these games, IN THEIR DAY, were defining. Revoluntionary. FUN. Halo, Silent Hill, Midnight Club, Quake 2, Half-Life 1 were hyped yesterday and are being hyped today. Someone persuaded the masses somehow to buy them, and I got caught up in it.Bring back games with imagination and - gasp - an actually satisfying fun factor. These days its hard to find the good ones (Burnout 3, MK Deception, Return to Castle Wolfenstein) amongst the throngs of retarted trash. Grand Theft what? Pixel porn and finding the best way to torture and mutilate people (Punisher, Manhunt). No wonder people think violence stems from video games. By removing the fun and innovation, that's all they got anymore!\n",
      "I dont think im even shure that is from the silenthill series.This game is confusing and it gets sortof boring.You might like this one if you like walking around never finding any thing realy diferent from the same floating in bodyments that hurt you when they touch you?i rented it and hated it.\n",
      "The set up sounded interesting enough.  Man trapped in apartment, which showed more signs of decay as the time passed.  Man finds hole in wall, and--in his desperation to get out--decided to go inside, and into a hellish adventure. Game, START.When actually playing the game, though, suddenly you wish that the main character, James Townsend, would just succumb to the monsters, ghosts, and other unnamable creatures trying to kill him.  Why?  Because nearly everything is wrong with the game.First, the good stuff: The graphics and the creepy atmosphere is on par and above when compared to its Playstation 2 predecessors.  Someone mentioned the graphics is brigher than before, which is a great welcome since I wasn't too much of a fan of the too dark to play atmosphere.  The music is on key, providing an appropriately somber welcome during the introduction and an ant-crawing-up-your-spine chills during gameplay.  This makes the bonus soundtrack included with pre-orders a gem to own.Now, the bad stuff.  I do not like the new inventory system one bit.  You can only carry a small amount of items, and when you accidentally pick up useless ones, you have to trek back to your house (I'll talk about why that gets tiring later) and put it in your magic infinite box.  But you can't risk NOT picking up the item, because you MIGHT need it and you need to pick up it up to read the description of it.  This limited inventory system is made even worse by the fact that each CLIP of 12 bullets for your first gun (this goes for later firearms, too) takes up one space in your iventory by itself!  Sure, in your magic infinite capacity box they take up only one space for all the bullets, but in your pocket, yes, one space per clip.  This makes guns a very unreliable source of protection... or you can run home everytime you run out of bullets...assuming you HAD any.  Ammo is terrible scarce, even on easy mode.  You can rely on your trusty melee weapon near the beginning, but later on, the enemies are too tough, one big healing resource is taken away from you and turned into a source of hp depletion, and you have concerns other than your own life (such as, getting a good ending) to risk just bashing the enemies brains in with a shovel.Adding to even more trips back to your pad is that fact that the only place to save is on a notebook in your apartment.  So yes, you have to go there everytime you want to save.  Horrible!  When I'm in the middle of the story, I don't want to make an extra special trip back to my apartment just so I don't lose an hours worth of play.Healing items are also scarce, so in the first half of the game, anytime you needed to heal up your HP, you run home and wait for your HP to fill back up.The trip back to and from the apartment through the hole in your wall gets tiresome around the fifth time to do it.  Leaving the apartment, you get the same animation for \"warp speed into the depths of despare through a stone pipe\" everytime, and no matter how many buttons I press, I can't skip that movie.  Same thing with returning to your apartment, you have to endure the annoying \"James is not a morning person\" ritual of getting out of bed that takes WAY too long for it to be fun when you're on a routine trip back to your place for a save or to drop off some items.The ghost enemies are the most annoying enemies I've ever encountered.  At first I was scared, since I couldn't kill them and their mere presence depletes your HP, but soon they just grew into a pain in the rear.  In a certain level, there were a lot of narrow passageways.  If a ghost were to approach (and they approach fast), you would have to take it down (you can stun them) before proceeding... that would have been fine, if its undead body doesn't block your walkway!  So you find yourself in a hopeless situation that causes you to find the nearest exit, leave, and come back into the room, hoping you can outrun the ghost this time before it blocks your path.Okay, so this could be made up with a great story.  Silent Hill 3 wasn't the most innovative in gameplay, but the GREAT backstory made up for the small number of flaws and made it a fantastic horror experience.  This time, the story could not overcome all the problems with gameplay.  Bits of the story is revealed as you play, but it just doesn't happen fast enough for is not riveting enough to keep me interested.  James seems like a nice enough guy, but since you mostly encounter the dead, or people who aren't key to the story for the first half of the game, you don't find out too much about James at all.I've been a big fan of the Silent Hill series since the first game came out, but this one is just utterly dissapointing.  I know they didn't rush it, but the problem might be they tried too many things that just didn't work.  I'm a fan of creative innovation, but just because it's new doesn't mean I'll praise it.  Back to the drawing board with you, Konami!\n",
      "Though I admit the premise is intriguing, and the atmosphere is spooky as hell, there is very little real substance to the game, and I'm not sure why I continue to play these Silent Hill titles.  Lots of walking around whacking these creatures with a plank of wood...  That's not my idea of fun gaming, and I find it disappointing that in some ways Silent Hill has set the standard for survival horror lower than it should be.  They all pale in comparison to other games in the genre like Fatal Frame, Resident Evil, and Clocktower.\n",
      "To see how ripped off Nintendo is, let's do a simple conversion math.The goal is to find a 1019 Blocks card has how many Mega Byte or Kilo Byte?Let us do some calculation8 Bit = 1 Byte1 Mega Bit or Byte = 1024 Kilo Bit or ByteMemory Card 1019 Blocks = 64 Mbit = 65536Kbit = 8192 KByte = 8 MByte8192 KByte / 1019 blocks = 8.0393 KByte/blockHow much is nintendo charging? $28.95How large is Playstation 2 card?8 Mega Byte = 64 Mbit = 59 blocks *64/4 = 944 BlocksHow much are we paying for 512 MByte SD, Compact Flash, or Memory Stick?Around $8.00 or even Free.And who wants 512MB cards these days?Not a lot of people, almost no one. Most people today are going for 1 to 2 GB or 4GB for flash memory for PSP, MP3, Videos, and Pictures.Lets use the $8.00 = 512MB = 60416 Blocks as of today's standard. That means 1019 blocks should cost:1019/60416 * $8.00 = $0.135Wow so Nintendo is actually over priced by 641.12% by charging at $1.00.So in conclusion:Nintendo is 18,272% over charged consumers for only 8 MB memory card, which no body even use today for any mp3 players nor USB massive storage device with even many times faster speed than this Gamecube card!!!!!The saddiest part is for those people who has Wii and want to play Gamecube games, they are forced me use the Gamecube memory cards.  You cannot save Gamecube data on Wii Internal memory nor SD cards!!!!Nintendo is creating a hazzles to consumers!!\n",
      "The Wii will destroy the card at random.All saves on the card will corrupt.  They will remain corrupt when moved to a 59 or a 251.  They remain corrupt when using the card on a REAL Gamecube.  The card remains corrupted when all saves on the card have been erased and new saves are started using ONLY a real Gamecube.It's a $20 white brick.The background:I purchased this 1019 memory card when I bought my Wii.  I never had a Gamecube, so I thought I'd mess around with some Gamecube games due to the Wii's backwards compatibility.  Deceptively, with no issues, I played several Gamecube games on my Wii over the course of a few months.Then I played F-Zero GX with 1019 on Wii.  From that point on, my 1019 was bricked and all my saves were lost.  Are certain games' save mechanisms not compatible with Wii/1019?  Is the Wii randomly introducing electric shock to corrupt the card?  The cause may not be known, but I have a $20 white brick.  It can't be formatted.I'll consider buying another someday, but only to use in a real Gamecube.\n",
      "This piece of s*** Corrupted on me out of nowhere. I was enjoy playing my videogames and all of a sudden the saved data erased.\n",
      "By this point, most gamers have tried the original \"Donkey Kong\".  While not quite as iconic as Pac-Man, \"Donkey Kong\" was effectively what put Nintendo on the map in the gaming industry, and the debut of a certain \"Jump Man\", who would later be renamed Mario.  You may have heard of him.  He went on to have a pretty successful career after this game.So what is \"Donkey Kong\"?  A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man. Jump Man must avoid the barrels, jump over other obstacles, climb ladders, etc, to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of Bowser . . . er . . . Donkey Kong!What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of \"Donkey Kong\".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\", and \"Super Mario Bros.\"), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.  The Japanese \"Famicom Mini\" series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the West.In terms of Donkey Kong, I would pick it up on the Virtual Console if you really want to play it.  Do not waste your money on the Gameboy Advance version.\n",
      "...but I don't like this game at all. I'm a big Zelda fan and loved all the GBC, N64, GBA and GameCube games, but because of my age, I had never played the \"classic\" Zelda games. So I picked this up, aiming to be a full-blown Zelda aficionado.Yet within a few minutes of play, I realized that the game was far too primitive for someone reared in the era of Link's Awakening DX and Ocarina of Time. There are no NPCs to talk to, no exploration to be done, none of anything that I had come to expect from the series. I am well aware that I was probably expecting too much, but whether that's true or not, I was disappointed.Although I didn't find anything to enjoy in this game, I'm not saying that it's bad. I'm sure that it was a classic of its era, and those who grew up with NES games will probably fall in love with it all over again. But from the perspective of someone who relies only on what she has read and heard for info on this bygone time, it simply seems like a bland, watered-down hack 'n slasher.\n",
      "PACMAN is the game that basically defined the Arcade.  But this isn't the &quot;Classic Arcade Series&quot; its the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; which means we get the NES version.  This is NOT a good thing and while PACMAN is one of the games that will NEVER be forgotten the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; doesn't capture it in all its glory.  PACMAN was a nice classic Arcade game. I wouldn't consider the NES version to be a classic in anyway.  There are a few things that stand out as to why.The gameplay isn't bad. You're PACMAN in a maze eating up little yellow pelts.  The Big Pelts give you the chance to capture the ghost.But as I said some things are just wrong.  For example, the Arcade version was a stretched out screen with the score at the top.  This version shows the score off to the far right and tries to hard to fit it into the screen.  You'll notice that PACMAN, the fruit and the ghost are all bigger than the corridor of the maze.PACMAN also suffers from what many other Classic NES games suffer from and this one has it bad.  For one ITS BEEN RE-RELEASED SEVERAL TIMES!  If you have the Namco Museum you're fine (and that's even out on the GBA).  Don't buy the classic NES series of PACMAN. Instead buy the Namco Museum package.  Not only is it better but its also the Arcade version.\n",
      "For roughly the same price, you could get Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, it plays on all Game Boy systems, and has everythign this game has plus a lot more. Does this game have Super Mario Bros. 2 hidden in it? No. Does it have a calendar? No. Mini games? No. You're much better off with Mario Bros. Deluxe.\n",
      "I will most likely get many \"NO's\" for \"was this review helpful?\" because of my negative review and I hate to be the oddball of the bunch, but please hear me out before voting \"NO.\"I was a Mario fanatic during my freshman year of highschool. Playing Mario Brothers for hours on end. I would leave the console on at night (there was no saving Marios progress) only to have to start over the next day because mom turned off the console... she just didnt understand, \"I made it all the way to world 5-3!!!\" Mario was a huge success for its time!!! There was nothing better!!! So, feeling nostalgic, I picked up a copy for my gameboy advance.After a few hours of gameplay, I was done with it. In this day and age where games of the same price can be so much more entertaining... why did I blow my money on Mario? Its not that I expected cutting edge graphics, or changing the game (why change a classic. I would have been able to make it thru to the end if they just added one feature... just one. A simple thing like a save game feature would have given it 3 stars from me.This is a perfect example of Nintendo recycling old games and making a bundle. No thought process went into this... it was an old idea repackaged. One thing this did for me, is made me appreciate the advancement in the video game industry. In a day and age when reviewers complain about games being too repetitive, Mario does not deserve a good review... even from those of us who grew up with PAC MAN and GALAGA.I will agree that when Mario first hit the streets, it was the greatest thing out there. However at this point and time, Mario is definitly showing his age. Think to yourself... if this game was released today... for the first time ever.... would it truely deserve 4+ stars?\n",
      "I HIGHLY don't reccommend you buy this.Unless you can play about 20 hours straight or have an AC adapter, then you can buy it.This doesn't even have a SAVE FEATURE!How messed up!I tried many ways, including asking Nintendo.There is none, which is completely absurd.\n",
      "I am an avid star wars fan, but this is unbearable! I went into this game with high hopes because the game got such good reviews and I'm such a huge fan, however, I came out confused and ultimately very upset. It's not like the game is a complete mess and doesn't do anything right, it's just not fun and overall unbelievably forgettable. Let's start with the graphics: At times, I felt like I was playing an early xbox 360 game, but most of the time it felt like a ps2 game or something, especially the outside portions of the game. I found them to be blurry and lacking detail. Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is atrocious to say the least. The mechanics and everything are fine, but it takes too many bullets to take down certain enemies and overall it's just very repetitive and not fun at all. I would equate this game to left for dead because the enemies come and keep on coming. They are relentless and you don't even have time to look around at the environment. This game is not even in the same league as halo, so don't even say it. Now, I would go over some other things in the game, but if you're like me then the gameplay is probably the most important thing and you already know how I feel about it, so I will leave you with a list of my favorite fps games of all time and you can see why I thought this game was crap. These are in order starting with the best. 1. Goldeneye-N64, 2. Perfect Dark-N64, 3. Red Faction PS2, 4. Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor Underground-PS1, 5. Bioshock, and Bioshock Infinite- XBOX 360. Some of my other favorites are Halo-XBOX, Cold Winter-PS2, Times Splitters 2 and Future Perfect-PS2, XBOX, Area 51-XBOX, PS2, Duke Nukem 3D and the list goes on and on.\n",
      "the only way i can explain the positive reviews for this game are simply my theory that gamers are idiots.  they'll play anything if it's given good reviews and other people like it.  there's nothing new in mercenaries that hasn't been done before.  you accept a contract.  you drive around to the bad guy and subdue him or kill him.  o...... k.  all this has been done before (and vastly more interesting) in games like metal gear solid, call of duty, hitman etc. etc. etc.  it's not fun or challenging, or original.  also the gameplay itself is bad.  shooting people isn't fun here, you just pull the trigger and move your crosshairs across the screen.  boring.  the graphics aren't very good either.  just because other people say it's good doesn't make it so.\n",
      "this game could be one of the best games out there, but it has way too many bugs. here are the most anoying ones: character gets trapped inside boulder and can't get out, game sometimes say there's no controller connected, and the most annoying one - I successfully entered the abort codes for the nukes after hours of really intense battles, eliminated the foot soldiers, then the game froze just as I was about to capture the ace of spades!!! what the heck!!!\n",
      "I really liked the first two Jak games, so I was excited to try Jak 3. Whoa. Major mistake. This game is nothing more than a lame racing-wannabe. I was very disappointed in this game. If you are expecting a platformer, look elsewhere.\n",
      "I know this game came out a long time ago.  However, I recently dusted off the old PS2 in an attempt to pick up some gems I missed.  Boy, was I wrong about this game.  It is a good idea to bring an exclusive FPS to the PS2, one that is unique, fun and has good replay value.  This is not that game.  To give consumers a clue, on the back the only review it cites is from Playstation Magazine, which gave it a-you guessed it-9.5.  Hmmm....what a surprise.This game is a standard FPS.  Story-wise you play an ISA (good guys) soldier named Templar who is part of the army tasked with repelling the Helghast (bad guys) invasion.  The campaign is quite long for an FPS, which would be a plus...if the game was fun to play.There isn't much weapon variety-or mission variety for that matter.  Most weapons have a unique secondary fire, but more often than not you'll be using the plain old assault rifle.Gameplay wise the game is rather dull.  It consists mainly of walking a set path and Helghast pop out at you.  That's it.  There is some variety like taking out tanks, but overall if you play for prolonged periods of time you will get bored.Graphics-wise it's okay I guess.  I'm used to next-gen graphics now so I don't really know.  However, in some situations it does seem like the game is too much for the PS2 to handle, so the fps drops.  Also, the game is so DARK.  I mean, it wouldn't be that bad if they gave us a flashlight, but they dont.  A lot of time is spent in corridors, which are so dark and disorienting you won't know which end is up.  You won't even be able to see your weapon.  Maybe this is why they made the Helghast have the glowing eyes-otherwise nobody would be able to spot them!  Furthermore, the game has a very grainy, washed-out look.  Some may say it adds to the warlike feel, but I think it just contributes to making the game boring.  Finally, there is virtually no notable music in this game.  This is a major con when comparing to Halo, which has a fantastic musical score that is abundant throughout the game.Now onto my biggest gripe-the controls.  I don't know who the heck was in charge of controls for this game, but they should be fired.  These are the clunkiest controls of any game I have ever played in my entire life.  Aiming is very difficult due to it being very, very sensitive.  Hope you don't want to walk or run while shooting, because that will take a ton of practice.  Most of the time in order to hit anything you have to take cover, pop out, and fire.  Rinse and repeat for each hallway.  Character movement is also sluggish; it feels like my guy is walking in tar or something.This game has online multiplayer as well as offline against bots.  I can't really say much now since there were like 20 people online when I played.  The problem with this is that those 20 are the really hardcore fans that have been playing since it came out and are practically pros at it by now, so expect to get destroyed.  However, even if I was better, the clunky controls still hinder online as it does with the campaign.Overall I think this is a poor choice for an FPS if you're in the market for one.  There are many others out there that offer a more compelling story, cooler weapons, and most importantly: comfortable controls.  I believe this was a sorry effort on Sony's part to compete with Halo.  The good critic reviews make me seriously puzzled-this game in no way is above average for first person shooters.  It is the exact definition of average-nothing about it makes it unique. Buy this only if you want 20 hours of frustration and boredom in a dark hallway.  I'm not trying to blindy bash the game-just trying to give a different voice than the others that have so highly praised this game.PROS:Decent graphicsOffline and Online multiplayerLong campaign-good valueCONS:Horrid controlsHardly any musicDark, dreary and grainy lookBoring (repetitive)Lack of imaginative weapons\n",
      "I just ejected this game partway through and put it in my Goodwill pile.  What's wrong with it?  The question is, where do I begin?The AI is retarded.  Sometimes they just sit there looking at you five yards away like they are blind, but  mostly they just wander back and forth.  They don't banzai charge nor do they hide and make you come after them.  All you have to do is keep your gun trained on their doorway and they repeatedly wander into your sights.The things the characters and enemies shout are stupid and repetitive, and the groans they make when they get hit become annoying.  And I don't like their stupid British accents, either.  If you hit them with one bullet they shout, \"I'm under heavy fiah!\"The weapons aren't accurate beyond point blank range (although the bad guys seem to have no trouble hitting you at long range,) and it takes several hits to kill one bad guy.  If you see three of them bunched together at thirty yards, you can empty a whole clip at them and sometimes not even kill one of them, while they are busy shouting, \"Suppressing fiah!  Aaaugh!  I'm under attock!\"  There is a sniper rifle, but the aiming system is idiotic and nearly impossible to use.Your character is slow, and areas are large, which is normally a good thing, except here you can't hit anything beyond fifty yards.  You can sprint, but only for a short ways, and you can't fire while you are sprinting.  The bouncy way your character walks is lame, too.  Plus, the pathway is totally linear.  There are no side areas worth exploring, no hidden items or powerups to look for, and since you can only carry three weapons at a time, most of the ammo you find is unusable.  There is a ton of the ammo for the standard rifle, but hardly any for the bomb launchers.  Reloading takes a long time, too.  Your character can't jump, and small curbs and boxes hold him up.  There are about four obstacles in the game that you can \"vault\" over, which takes several seconds and is a lame feature.Your teammates are seemingly invincible, so when you run across bad guys you can just hide and let your teammates kill them--that is unless they come and hide behind you.  If you and your whole team is in firing position, all of the bad guys shoot at you and the rest of your team stops firing and strolls over to your side appearing \"at the ready.\"  Other times they will shout, \"This way,\" take a few steps down the path, and then stop and wait for you to take point.  They get in your way a lot, too.There are no health packs, I don't think, but your health recharges over time.  So if you get hit, all you have to do is hide out for a few seconds (in complete safety since the enemies don't charge) and you're back to full health.When you die, the camera pans around your dead body for ten or fifteen seconds, while I am wishing I could get on with the game.  That was really annoying.  In fact nearly everything about this game is annoying.  I had played the excellent Project Snowblind right before this, and Killzone was a major letdown in comparison to it, or to all other FPS's for that matter.\n",
      "Only a baffoon would not see this coming.  If it can't even handle Deus Ex 1 and Rainbow Six 3, what makes you think it's going to be able to run a halo clone.  Call up any psychic, they'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you.  Sattle up the syrup boys, we are headed to the flopzone.\n",
      "This game I thought would be good but it is very annoying. In the game when you kill someone they make the same annoying sounds. They say the same things when they get hurt. They shooting was alright but not great. I just bought this game to see if I liked it but didn't. Probably won't buy killzone 2.\n",
      "What a piece of garbage!!!  I rented this game and returned it the next day because I didn't want it to plague my other PS2 games with its filth.  Thank goodness I didn't buy this crap.  The framerate is terrible and the screen feels like its right up in your face.  I couldn't play it because it gave me a headache; the first time ever while playing video games.  From what I hear, you shoot the same looking bad guys the entire game.  What fun is that?  I'd give it a zero.  I've gotta go.  Thinking about the $6 I spent on renting this game is starting to make me angry, and you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\n",
      "Our whole family highly dislikes this game. We purchased it because of great reviews on Amazon, yet this game doesn't have enough save points and after 30 minutes we got tired of replaying the same paths over and over again, each time with less ammo.\n",
      "I am taking my time to write a honest review about this game. If you are those kind of people who like games who resemble the real life then this game is not for you.The NEGATIVES (which are more then the positives by the way).* IN real life when teams are on offense most of the time DEFENSES get tired. Well, in madden 2005 and 2006 that is not the case, if your offense is on the field most of the time your offense gets tired and their defense gets stronger.*When the computer wants to score there is NOTHING you can do. Even If your CB is covering,  the ball will go through his body and the WR will catch it ( i have never seen that in other games like ESPN).*As we all know in MADDEN players are rated by an overall number. IN madden 2005 and 2006 for example if your defense is agains the computer you have a big disadvantage one single offensive linemen can block 3 (99 overall) players of your defense.*The most ridiculus part of this game is when a CPU player is running in one direction and then accelerates in the ooposite direction and tackles your player and the block at the same time.I can keep going on and on and tell you why after 5 minutes this game is not fun anymore, but the negatives are so many that I would need days to review this games (2005 and 2006).If you ask yourself why am I including madden 2006 in my review? I do it because i have a friend who is a game tester and he told me that the gameplay of Madden 2006 is exactly the same as the 2005.Personally i am done with the MADDEN series until thye re-disign the gameplay and it resembles more to real life.\n",
      "I admit it, I have something of an ulterior motive in rating this game so low.  It's a good football game, really it is.  However, after playing EA Sports titles for the past decade, I've discovered a football game I like much better.  Unfortunately, because of EA and the NFL's greed, exclusive rights to NFL licensed products has been granted...meaning we will not get an ESPN NFL 2K6 game.  Hence, I will no longer be playing EA titles.  For any serious gamers out there that welcome competition among our titles, thus ensuring that the best products are available, join my in my boycott.  Like I said earlier, I prefer the bulk of EA's sports titles to the ESPN brand.  However, I think their NHL and NFL products are surperior to EAs.  But I'll no longer have a choice in NFL products.  I'm not happy with either EA or the NFL.\n",
      "I bought Madden 04 and I loved it, primarily due to the incredible new owner mode, but this year there's a new football champ and his name is ESPN 2K5. This game is amazing and it's only 20 bucks! Save yourself 30 bucks and go with the game that won best of show awards @ E3. Sorry EA sports, you lose! game over.\n",
      "there is one thing it must have in 2005 if I'm going to buy it.In Dynasty mode, when you create your schedule at the beginning of the year, you must play X number of games in your conference, and you can't change them. In 2003, Michigan did not play Penn State or Wisconsin. So, even if I play 20 years of Dystany football with Michigan, I can NEVER play against PSU or WI.I would also like to see being able to switch players' positions. If I have 8 guards rated at 99, and 2 centers at 50, I can't cut the centers and have one of the guards move over.And it would be cool to see Michigan run out of the tunnel, hitting the GO BLUE banner on the way out.New audio clips really needed to be added. I've played a lot of hours on 2004, and I'm really sick of hearing the same comments over and over and over again.Let's hope 2005 improve these areas, and I'll be happy!\n",

Go buy a better game like tales of symphonia that games the best if you are like 5-8 this game (zelda four swords) is ok but any older it just not worth your money good thing my freind bought it and let me play. Game play it the worst it nothing like the old zelda game like OOT or MM this is just like a game boy Adv zelda game but you pay alot more.Over all this is a peace of junk sorry nintendo but I know you can do better next time.\n",

      "I've been a long time fan of LSL & have played the games since I was about 12 & snuck onto my dad's computer. I was overjoyed to see that there was going to be another outing for this series & was looking forward to it, even when I heard that the series was not going to surround our favorite hero, Larry. However when I actually played the game I was incredibly dissapointed.Unlike it's predecessors, the game is entirely a series of minigames instead of the point & click first person interface of the previous ones. That wouldn't have been so bad except they were the same exact mini-games that repeated with each character you pursue. The plotline was actually pretty watered down for a LSL release & was obviously missing the signature Al Lowe humor that made the previous ones so popular. There were some funny moments in the game (such as the 'Summer Loving'-esque song in the gay bar), but they were few & far between. Ultimately I was glad that I'd rented it for my PS2 instead of actually buying it.  I have to say that I didn't entirely expect it to be great when I discovered that it was due for the PS2 as well as for the computer, but I didn't expect it to be as terrible as it was. For people who just discovered the series, they are sure to be pleasantly surprised when they discover how much more entertaining the original games are, but for the rest of us... well, we'll always have the originals.\n",
      "I see that there is no mention of Al Lowe being involved with creating this.  If he is missing, then I can guarantee you that the humor and gameplay quality will be missing as well, and online opinion would seem to confirm this.What a shame that Sierra wasn't smart enough to employ him.  I was looking forward to a real LSL game, not a rip off.\n",
      "Dear Reader:  I suspect you are on the Chessmaster 10 page because you are unaware of the Fritz program (Amazon ASIN: B000B643GA), which is what serious chess players use to play chess, both against the computer and against others on the internet.Chessmaster (even version 9) has got to be one of the most irritating, intrusive pieces of software that I've ever installed on my computer.First of all, before permitting itself to be installed, Chessmaster scans your hard drive for any software it deems illicit, such as CloneCD or other kinds of Windows utilities that allow users to duplicate files.  If it detects anything it doesn't like, it won't allow you to install the game on your computer.  The problem is, much of the software on its \"banned\" list are, or at least were intended to be, completely innocuous.  As if this wasn't enough, Chessmaster won't deign to tell you which piece of software it objects to, leaving you to guess.  What's really baffling is the realization that software pirates could easily copy the Chessmaster CD without having to install it first, of course!  So what was the point of the programmers having Chessmaster do this?  To strike a blow for intellectual property rights in general?Anyhow, another irritant is that the Chessmaster game has decided to model itself on certain racing games, which only unlock certain tracks and cars if you've beaten certain lesser opponents and tracks.Well, Chessmaster works the same way.  The programmers have decided to make certain colored 2-D boards and all the 3-D boards unlockable, meaning that you can't adjust the board's colors and look to suit you, unless you \"unlock it.\"  This means you have to play about, I think, 25 games at a certain level before you're even allowed to play 3-D chess, one of the reasons many people buy this particular program, I think.  Very frustrating for those who like to play 3-D right from the outset.But it goes further.  Chessmaster also won't allow you to specify your level, meaning that you have to play dozens of probably unpleasant games against opponents which probably cruelly out-rank you, or laughably under-rank you.  You have to \"earn\" your rating, so to speak.  You're not allowed to start playing at your level for quite some while, and you're also not allowed to play above your level.No, I'm not finished yet. I've noticed that chess programs are popular on laptop computers because of their low graphics and sound requirements.  Unfortunately, Chessmaster requires you to insert the disk every time you play it, making play on-the-go more of a hassle.Boy, am I sorry I bought this thing!\n",
      "Rarely am I compelled to stop what I am doing and write a review about a product. However, this product is such garbage, that I felt that need.In fact, it should receive no stars.First, the game can only be used with certain video cards, which is something I did not learn until after I received the product. Specifically, it can only be used with a GeForce 1/2/3/4/FX or an ATI 7500-9000 series graphics processor. Now keep in nind, I meet those specs anway.Second, you need the 1st CD (of 3) to play the game. Although not normally a problem, if you have an ultraportable or tablet PC, forget about this product.Third, the installation is over 540mb minimum install. Thats if you do not install anything but just the pure game files.After installing, I rebooted my Dell 8300 (2gb Ram P4 3.0, 400gb hard drive, ATI Graphics card with 256mb RAM on board). I started the program, and it locked up my computer. Tried again, no luck. Rebooted and tried opening the program, it finally opened. However, all the graphics were off.Long story short, this game should be taken off the market and the development team put out on the street.ALL I WANT TO DO IS PLAY CHESS!!!!!! DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION!\n",
      "If you're considering buying this game, consider very carefully, especially if you enjoyed some of the earlier \"Myst\" games. There is very little that is positive about \"Myst IV: Revelation\" besides the high-quality graphics, camera, improved movement and the theme song that plays at the main menu. In general, the game is a frustrating queue of puzzle after puzzle, with little incentive to actually spend the time to solve them. The worlds are disappointing, and the game has a heavy dose of New-Age material, signifying a departure from the mainly mechanical nature of the earlier \"Myst\" games.The AgesWhile every detail is in place, and the quality of the graphics good, the worlds are disappointing; unattractive and un-enjoyable to interact with.Tomanha is a collection of glass houses; nice aspects, but could have been better.Haven is one of the better worlds, with a few lovely places. Still, it wasn't that great.Spire is the ugliest world I've ever seen in any of the \"Myst\" games. If you've seen the Disney rendition of \"Sleeping Beauty\" you'll see Spire bears a resemblance to the evil Maleficent's castle.Serenia, while difficult to actually describe, is an unlikable world nonetheless. It is chock-full of New-Age material.The PuzzlesNot all the puzzles in this game are hard, but some are time consuming and frustrating. In Serenia especially once you solve one puzzle another one soon follows. Unlike in \"Myst III: Exile\" where you don't mind spending an hour fiddling with controls, all you want to do with \"Revelation\" is get the puzzles, and the whole game for that matter, done and over with.The infamous \"Mangree Puzzle\" is located in Haven. Even when you know what you are supposed to accomplish and are good at producing the correct sounds, it's still a pain. You also have to deal with \"The Throne\" in Spire (no pun intended). This puzzle also deals with sounds and it's annoying-a walkthrough is recommended if you have my patience level. Unless you're lucky, you'll need a game patch for the \"Mangree Puzzle\" and probably for \"The Throne.\" Fortunately, the patches are free and fairly easy to download and install at Ubisoft's website.This game is not worth your time or money. For the most part, the worlds are un-enjoyable, the puzzles aren't fun and all you want to do is finish the game as quickly as possible. If you want, listen to the theme song somehow, the best thing about \"Revelation\" and perhaps see screenshots if you want to see what the game looks like. But if you liked the other Myst games, there is absolutely no guarantee you'll like this one; in fact, it will probably be exactly the opposite.\n",

The combat system is virtually worthless, Jedi's kill all PVP players to earn more points, and content is extremely lacking. Which brings up a point. In the expansion the devs have stated that most of your time will be spent on the ground as opposed to space travel (making money to pay for repairs / upgrades / etc). Well isn't the ground where all the problems and glitches are? I seriously doubt that the new expansion will fix many problems. I really believe it is yet another way to get people to spend more money on empty promises.

YOu can get most ships that have been seen in the movies, but as Imperial you'll want to complete the \"Jedi Starfighter\" quest which gives you Anakin's Episode III fighter.What is fun about that is that it's the best fighter in the game - so Ship building professions cannot build anything that is nearly as good and thus have become worthless... and with the advent of the NGE pushed into an even more minority status.This expansion is also currently free with the \"Starter Kit\" that is also available on Amazon... but it's not really worth it.I'd suggest buying some Chuck Norris movies.\n",

Instead, they were hard at work on an \"Expansion Pack\" to sell us! And then once again \"promised us\" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, \"just hang on, this game is going to be great!\" They promised us that they were going to do this \"Combat Upgrade\" and do it right, and it \"wouldn't be released until it's ready!\"We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited \"CU\" would be coming out along with the \"Rage of the Wookiees\" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the \"CU\" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could \"streamline\" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or \"EverStar Galaxies QuestWars\" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.You have been warned!\n",

      "After playing through FM3 at least 20 times, when I had heard Square Enix was going to be making FM4 I was extatic.  Finally after long months of waiting I was able to finally purchase the game.  After about 8 hours of gameplay the game found itself amid the rest of the trash on my bedroom floor.  What happened??  How could FM4 be such a disappointment?  All Square had to do was keep all the features of FM3, create a new intriging storyline, boost the graphics, and thats all she wrote.  They boosted the graphics, started a decent storyline (from the 8 hours of the game that I played) but took out way to many features that made FM3 so great.  They completey destroyed the customization system in this game.  Pilots skills are basically pre set.  It doesnt matter how long you practice with your weapons anymore bc you can only get skills for the beginning weapons your characters start our with.  Wanzers designs are sub par at best and very generic.  Forget about trying to capture enemy wanzers.  They completely removed that feature from the game.  So no more slicing and dicing captured enemy wanzers (one of the coolest features I thought in FM3)  They got rid of the net surfing.  I am sure plenty of ppl thought this feature was annoying and useless in FM3.  Well it never really affected the game so if players didnt like the net they didnt have to use the feature. The net would only reward players who took the time to surf and discover all the hidden training maps and programs you could download.  Remeber this review was only written based on 8 hrs of gameplay.  But for me thats all that was needed.  They really killed the skill system in my opinion.  And that was the top reason why I loved FM3 so much, for its EXP and Skill system.  This game will never touch my PS2 again.\n",
      "game will not install,no solutions found by company.i cant even try the game,it simply wont work,waste of money,might as well flush your money down the toilet.\n",
      "Rushed, they didn't even beta test it, and they only internally playtested it, and it shows.HORRIBLE AI, sloppy unit movement, poor controls, and lackluster gameplay highlight this title.  Worst of all, most of the gameplay is copied from Kohan and Kohan2, and doesn't even measure up to those games!Poor, avoid it.\n",
      "Sorry for being a stick in the mud but if I had seen this game running before I got it I probably would have just watched someone else play it. The big con to this game (that I was really looking forward to playing) is the fixed world camera with a tiny little tilt to the left or right that springs back the moment you release the key. Zooming in or out takes you somewhat closer to the fights but you cannot choose your action viewpoint meaning that TBFME is a very limited RTS ( I knew it was limited but didn't realize how much)... so much so, that it is nothing more than draw a big box around whatever group is present on the screen and right click on the enemy and then watch the battle... but watch what? Amazing 2D fight sequences?... and I think you might just get my point here... -> The film is the better 2D fight sequences.I am sorry but the fact that you could not rotate the camera just blew me away. It felt like playing R-Type Final or some other 2D platform shoot `em up. The extreme (and I mean extreme) lack of critical thinking in this game just makes it a very glorious looking bad game. It is not even a game when compared to any modern RTS. The best way of describing it is like a gawk-fest where you can literally sit back and just let the game run itself. I would not have minded that if I could actually choose an angle to gawk at the battles.The best way of describing my disappointment is to imagine if the producers of this thing just recorded a demo of the whole game on DVD for you to watch.Anyhow, all this depends on how much time you invest in games. If you are a fan of the movie, and do not play games, then maybe this will satisfy you. If you have any experience with RTS gaming and a pimpin' fast computer you have a right to know that you can not rotate or tilt the world. If I knew that then maybe this item would have got a far better rating.I would love to have recommended it but sadly, I am a gamer and felt badly letdown by the lack of world controls. Something as simple as a 360 rotate with a 90-degree tilt would have made it five stars (even with the simplest of RTS controls). As I said, watching the film is better.\n",
      "All they did was take a poorly made RTS engine and slap LOTR into the title.  If you played age of empires or Empire Earth or even star craft back in the day, you'd understand what I mean. This game is horrible.\n",
      "The Good: The tetsugen is an awesome weapon, Kurenai is a sexy assassin, the game looks pretty goodThe Bad: Broken camera, terrible platforming, weird and awkward controls, stupid AI, generic looking enemiesI try to be forgiving with games, but there are some that just can't be overlooked. Red Ninja is a perfect example that has mechanics that are broken beyond reason or repair. The story is the first thing you will notice that isn't very interesting. You are trying to stop a rival clan from getting a machine gun blueprint from yours to use to destroy their enemies. The beginning cut scene shows your clan using a machine gun to cut down hordes of samurais. Just one machine gun. After this your leader tells the man in charge of making it to destroy it because it dishonors the rules of engagement. Sure that's noble, but all this for one stupid machine gun!You will notice the game is severely flawed in the tutorial. The camera is completely useless, the controls are awkward, the platforming is uncontrollable, and the enemies are stupid as well as generic. The only interesting thing in the whole game are the tetsugen weapon and Kurenai's panties. The camera is inverted no matter what you do. In the options you can turn it off, but it becomes inverted vertically instead of horizontally. I constantly had to consciously remember to turn the camera the opposite way I wanted it to go. This is so frustrating during already busted boss fights or when surveying enemy patrols. On top of all this the combat works a little, but needs a lot of work. You can use the tetsugen as a melee weapon or throw it from a distance and slice enemies in half. One awesome feature was being able to run around enemies in a circle while one is tethered and trip them down or cut them in half. Good luck keeping all the enemies focused because of that broken camera.Secondly is the platforming, this is probably more frustrating than anything because you need to do this to avoid enemy detection. You can shimmy ledges, ropes, wall run, and dash around, but the combination of the camera and the weird controls make it frustrating. Wall running consists of you having to be in a dash while running at a wall. You have to continue running while moving the analog stick in the direction you want Kurenai to run. This is ridiculous and unintuitive. A lot of times I had her bouncing off walls because the camera just couldn't keep up. Enemies will detect you even when you on rooftops which is weird. Swimming is no better because enemies can always see you and you can only hide underwater while being still. Completely useless. You can use projectiles by picking them up, but aiming them is just too time consuming. There should be some sort of auto-aim for these.If that isn't enough for you to stay away I don't know what will. I got two levels in and just couldn't take anymore. The camera constantly going berserk and doing its own thing, the stupid AI, weird control scheme, bad platforming, and just overall an unpolished mess. The combat is somewhat saveable, but the camera and controls make this frustrating as well. The game looks pretty good, but in the end you won't even care. Not even the sexy seduction kills are enough to save this game. I hope one day this series is revived, but needs to be built from the ground up. Just stay away from this pile of garbage.\n",
      "This Game absolutly sucks to the max the movie sucks how can the game posibly be any better sure the graphics are good but it sucks just as Aqua-man and super man geez katamari damacy is better than that if you want an good game get Halo 2 , Doom 3 or splinter cell chaos theory or at least get spiderman 2 the best marvel game out there you can explore new york and the fighting and controls are good. since the scale doesnt have a zero give this game a 1 out of 5\n",
      "The shipping was decently fast but i got a completely different Dragon Ball Z game in a Budokai 3 Case... I'm not happy at all about this transaction... i asked for Budokai 3 not Budokai Tenkaichi.. I want my money back ASAP!\n",
      "I didn't like this game.  I play games as a way to relax between work, a way to escape, a way to keep my mind stimulated.  Alida didn't do this for me.  Most of the time I wasn't quite sure why I was running back and forth doing things, and I never could figure out the whole logic (or whatever) with setting the planets in those covered trays and had to do them all trial and error (and must have done them wrong since there was no indication when you got them right--the other segments had some means of letting you know when things were set correctly).  When I finally go to the part where all the various items had been fiddled with and the lost chord should have played to open the vaults, nothing happened.  I sat there for a minute thinking about what was probably off and decided that whatever the ending, it had to be pretty sucky since the beginning premise was pretty lame--and I decided it wasn't worth going back and refiguring anything.  I just uninstalled it, took the game to work for someone else to try (for free).  There was no initial reason for me (as the hero) to want to go find whatever-the-woman's-name-was boyfriend (I'm rather sick of someone telling me something needs to be done, I've gotten to the point where I'm going, \"why can't you do it yourself you lazy bum???\") and since adjusting all those gizmos didn't give me any incentive, I didn't feel any need to successfully complete the game.  I seriously could not think of anything good (or interesting) happening if I'd just go back and correct my wrong setting--so I uninstalled.  It wasn't fun, the graphics were just okay by today's high standard, a little more incentive would have gone a long way to encourage this player to want to find the final solution.\n",
      "I play lots of adventure games. I'm smarter than your average bear. The puzzles were just stupid.Here is an example. You look in a window, and an old lamp is flickering. You are supposed to count the flickers, they are a code. A code to what? Another, totally unrelated puzzle far away. How do you know this? You cheat and use a walkthrough.The puzzles are so random. When you read the solution, you don't go \"ah ha!\" you go \"What the heck?\". With every adventure game, you sometimes have to go to a walkthrough to get unstuck. This game requires walkthrough help all the way through.Too bad, the graphics were kind of cool, the idea had potential, it's just the puzzles that failed this game.\n",
      "Very disappointed in this game because after three installs, it still will NOT work on my six-month old computer using Windows XP.  It keeps on crashing my computer and causing it to reboot.  When I was able to play it for a few minutes, the puzzles made no sense and were very difficult.  The instruction book that comes with the game is very poorly written and is not accurate.  The instructions are unclear and don't match up with what is displayed on your computer screen.  Perhaps this is due to the instructions being translated from French or something...I don't know.Very upset that I blew $20 on yet another game I cannot play on my computer.THIS GAME SUCKS!!  TOO MANY FRIGGIN' BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I just wanted to say that I nearly bought this game, but thanksto a lady I talked to at EB Games and the reviews by all you folks, I have saved my money. Many thanks for taking the time to submit a review...... Charlie Spivey Richmond VA."
